If it looks like he's taking his time it's because he's waiting for the temperature of the water to be just right before cooking the next bowl. Man is an artist and if you don't want to wait for his noodles then don't.\n2) Price - Running a hawker stall in Singapore is expensive. Why don't you ask the guy how much rent he pays every month before complaining that the noodles are too pricey? Yes it's more expensive than the average coffee shop meepok, but you're not getting average meepok are you?\n3) Unfriendliness - I've never really gotten this from them, but it's a kopitiam stall so I'm not sure what kind of Haidilao service people are expecting.\n\nI've been eating this since I was a kid and I've never once been disappointed by the food, wait time or service.
