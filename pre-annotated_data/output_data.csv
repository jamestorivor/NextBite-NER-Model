"The fishball noodles were evenly coated with the vinegar and chilli, al dente. There's the GU ZAO WEI for sure. The ingredients such as fishball, fishcake, minced meat were sufficient such that you get a bit of everything with every mouthful. Soup is enjoyable too. 1 bowl of noodles take about 5-8 minutes..so if you are in the queue.. that should give you an estimated waiting time. Hope it helps! Lots of parking available."
"The flavour is gone. After 15 years, I suddenly came to try , to my surprise the taste n flavour is all gone, noodle , they changed supplier, not springy but tuff , service was s slow, mayb purposely slow so as to recreate a long Q, chilly lost it taste, can't compare to his father standard, when they r at Frankie Ave, Not worth coming."
there was a super long queue for these noodles so we joined and let's just say it was worth the wait  the noodles were SOOO good and so flavourful!!! so so so yummy the soup was also really full of flavour - if you're coming to marine terrace you DEFINITELY need to queue for this
"Move from coffee shop to the hawker center, as usual, tastes good.
The sauce is always great"
"Overrated, a normal mee pok which required long waiting time."
Giving lower star so less people will queue and I can enjoy this delicious meepok without queueing
"We saw a queue of about 5 pax so decided to give this stall a shot (we should have read the reviews first). It took us about 25 minutes to reach the front of the queue and have our orders taken. That would have been fine if the food was good, however, the standard of the mee pok noodles here are way below average. Noodles were stiff, bland and there was close to no ingredients in the bowl. Highly disappointing experience. Safe to say this would be my first and last time waiting in line for this stall."
10 ppl in queue but preparing 10 grab orders. Make it make sense
"I been eating this stall 30 yearrs +++ ago when it was at Kembangan. It has recently moved from a nearby coffeeshop to Marine terrace hawker centre.

The food got better! The price got cheaper from $4 and bigger portion!  Super happy

Yea the boss is a little slow. And I got my noodles faster cos I am the first in queue.
He has always been this speed since I can remember."
"Downright slow, downright normal. I queued about 30mins with 3 customers in front of me. The boss really took his own sweet time with the noodles and everything. If you are in a rush for time, stay away. If you want something better look elsewhere"
"Today my wife who is a foreigner shared with me that she joined the queue for about 20 mins at this 132 meepok @ marine terrace. But when she came to front of the queue, the stall ignored her and took orders from people behind her... she continued to stand there waiting for order to be taken, and still the stall didn't take her order...

Granted she's a foreigner and may not speaks as fluently but do you hv to treat a person like this??

So given this stall's food may be good, I told her we would never ever come back to patronize them."
"Average bowl of noodles.. not worth your calories.. you will be disappointed, especially if you bothered to queue"
"Ordered 6 packets, told auntie one packet don't put vinegar she said I told her all don't put bean sprouts. Ownself heard wrongly still dare to argue. Worse attitude"
Ridiculously bad. Really really not edible. Madness. Slightly better when it was at the coffee shop nearby that they burned down some years ago now just terrible. Avoid!
"Uncle works alone. Not sure what happen to the other helper for him. He cooks real slow. He also takes time to replenish food etc. if U are 3rd in the queue, wait up to 30 mins. Mee pok dry with ketchup is good But too long a wait for 1 food. If you are 1st in the queue... I think U also have to wait for 10 mins for 1 bowl of noodles."
"An average bowl of noodles.
The noodles texture are good.
Ingredients are fresh.
Fishballs texture is good, but kind of small.
Chilli sauce and vinegar not bad.
Soup taste acceptable.
Worth a try."
"Wasting customers time by dragging the ordering and cooking process, that's not the way to create a queue. Serve good food and I am certain the queue will form naturally."
"Hearty bowl of Mee pok noodles. Bought a larger version as I was really hungry. Comes loaded with fishballs, fishcake, beansprouts and minced pork.

Noodles were well cooked and springy. Like the chilli here, which is not overly spicy."
"I feel, still one of the better old school mee pok. Standard has dropped compared to the Siglap days... just something is missing ..some omph is missing  New stall location 50A Marine Terrace in the middle roll! It's small Hawker Center so easy to find ! Have been a fan since they relocated  to opposite Siglap corner opposite DBS treasure.."
Extremely slow service. Owner is slowing down to create a queue. Don't waste time. There's another stall behind. The noodles 100times better. Very fast.
"My father and I have been loyal customers this Authentic Mee Pok in Singapore for over 20 years. However, we've stopped going recently due to their extremely slow service. It feels like the owner is intentionally stalling to create a queue--taking things in and out of the fridge, drinking water, organizing items, and wiping things down. A queue of just six people ended up with a 40-minute wait."
"Best meepok in Singapore hands down. Don't let all the negative reviews tell you otherwise. Ignorant fools dont know what they are talking about. Meepok is all about its springy texture, and no other place does meepok texture right except this place. Everywhere else has soggy meepok texture. Much easier to cook youmian than meepok. Their soup is awesome as well. Lots of umami flavor in there."
Dont ever Q. Its a waste of time. Noodles is soso. Yet Q is slow and long. The uncle took in grab orders and ignore Q in the line. The long Q is not due to nice food. But just him being greedy to earn more money from Grab.
"If authentic traditional teochew mee pok is what you are after, this is it. Can't go wrong with the $4 bowl or $5 with few more ingredients and one tasty her-keow. Noodles are rather doughy but nicely al dente. Old school tasting chilli sauce with or without ketchup up to you. What's not worth it in my opinion are the $6 bowl with one prawn or the $8 bowl with more ingredients. However I do appreciate the use of proper market prawns. Not frozen prawns like some other stalls. Overall true to their namesake but this is not for me. I'll return to my usual mindblowing Ah Ter Teochew Noodles at Amoy St for the same price."
"I think the mee pok is a tad undercooked as I get the floury mouthfeel with every bite, maybe the cook was using the tapao timing to cook my noodles. I find the sauce more on the salty side and could be more balanced with sour/sweet elements."
Be prepared for small portion. Today noodles not cooked.
"Fir me, meepok was a bit overcooked."
"Had fishball noodles ($6.50) for breakfast on 26/5/24, was good. Do note that they've already shifted to the hawker centre (Blk 50A) next building from 1/6/24."
"Probably the best Fishball Mee Pok in the world.

I am biased because I have been following this stall since the dad operated at Jalan Tua Kong (then Kembangan and then back to East Coast and now in Marine Terrace)

Today is the first day it is opened in the Food centre next to the kopitiam where it was for the last 10 years.

The prices are more or less the same ($5,$6 and $8)  and there is a new economic $4 version.  My usual $6 portion was today way too big but I am not complaining.

One thing I want to comment is that each bowl of noodles take a while to cook, and this is how it should be. And rather than increase the price or take short cuts to hasten the process, Chan the son and now owner of the stall, has traded down to the Food Centre so that he can manage the cost aspect while not compromising on the taste.

Speaking of taste, the secret is in the sauce. Here is an old 17 year old article on this 132 Mee Pok:  https://ieatishootipost.sg/132-mee-poh-the-original-east-coast-mee-poh-man/

The new address is :

""132 traditional Teochew noodle""
#01-285
50A Marine Ter, Singapore 441050
(Next to the coffeeshop where the stall was)

$6 Meepok + $6 ""liao Teng"""
"Above avg BCM. Too bad they dun have mee Kia. So I'm stuck with mee pok. It's a bit under cook for me, but so will call it Al dente 

Chili belongs to those more spicy with punch. Take note if can't eat spicy. Also the chili tends to be more on the salty side as well.

Ingredients is fresh and portion reasonable for today's cost.

Soup is nice and well balanced.

Can try if around this area. But will not travel just to have this BCM."
"Unbelievable pathetic serving of 3 small fish ball, 2 slice of fish cake and a small prawn for $6.50.

Will not recommend and nvr be going back ."
"I've been eating from this mee pok stall for decades. Even my daughter and son love it and rate it the best in Singapore. Can't deny there's waiting time involved due to its popularity. However, one can always avoid to peak dining hours and yet enjoy the succulent food. Their chilli is just legendary, together with the mee pok and their ingredients. You have to be a local to truly appreciate this. Also, this mee pok stall is located underneath a hdb block, in the ""heartland"". So, for folks looking for excellent white table service and ambience, please reset expectations. This stall is definitely a ""go-to"" for an excellent bowl of mee pok."
"The noodles have a great springy texture, and the fishballs taste excellent. Chilli is good!

It's a bit pricey, but definitely worth a try if you're in the area!"
Love the mee pok.
"Food is ok. But the aunty taking order is really pushing their customer away. Rude n as if we are Q-ing for free food.
The experience with her kill everything."
"Meepok is a personal thing and this is my personal favourite! The noodle-'liao' ratio is perfect. $5.50 (M) bowl gives you a decent portion of noodles, sliced pork, sliced fish cake, minced pork, fish balls and a prawn. The chili base is spicy and flavourful, and the soup is truly a tasty accompaniment. I've been eating here since secondary school and I'm in my 40s now :). Dad was the one who introduced me, and my daughter has been eating it since she was in my tummy! She now can finish an almost adult portion at 5yo, and is enthusiastic enough about it to want to self feed when she's here. :) Thank you for making such delicious noodles!"
"I'd like to say how unjustified some of the low-rated reviews were, and in particular about the food and the service.  I favour a kwey teow mee combo, and these are put into the water separately due to their uneven cooking times.  If you want good food, it usually takes time.  I dislike Seth Lui's horrid series about the worst-rated places to eat as there is a mean-spiritedness about this theme but their reviewer actually said that she would return and found the food great.  It is a hidden gem, and many people have been eating here for a long time, and for those who gave the poorly starred reviews, I'd prefer they stay away as they don't appreciate good food and otherwise the wait would get longer.  Have a heart for hawkers who work long hours and hard."
"The meepok is tasty, similar to his father."
Consistentky good bak chor mee since their days at upper east coast road. Chilli packs a punch.
"One of the best, if not top meepok in town. Texture of meepok is nicely done al dente. The pork lard is fragrant and crispy. The fishball is on average side but the main selling point is really the noodle, chilli sauce and lard concoctions."
"Best mee pok in Singapore. Hands down. I'm living in Canada now and this is the mee pok that I dream about almost daily. From the spicy chilli, tasty pork lard, springy noodles and amazing pork and prawn broth, I really miss this mee pok! Will be eating here daily when I come back for a holiday."
"There's a list of reasons why this meepok is great - Flavourful noodles cooked with pork lard, combined with prawn stock soup that gives the dish a super unique taste. Chilli is great too.

I've seen some other comments here that I don't really get:
1) Long wait times - there's only one man cooking I'm not sure what you expect. If it looks like he's taking his time it's because he's waiting for the temperature of the water to be just right before cooking the next bowl. Man is an artist and if you don't want to wait for his noodles then don't.
2) Price - Running a hawker stall in Singapore is expensive. Why don't you ask the guy how much rent he pays every month before complaining that the noodles are too pricey? Yes it's more expensive than the average coffee shop meepok, but you're not getting average meepok are you?
3) Unfriendliness - I've never really gotten this from them, but it's a kopitiam stall so I'm not sure what kind of Haidilao service people are expecting.

I've been eating this since I was a kid and I've never once been disappointed by the food, wait time or service. Will be a sad day when this guy decides to retire, one of the last few masters of his craft left."
The yan pi was fire overall a solid bowl of mee pok soup was above average on par wif siglap
Eating this will be detrimental to your physical and mental health
"Noodles I must say is ok, problem comes with the service though. Auntie taking the orders better buck up on your attitude. Won't patronise again for sure"
Very rude and forgetful.
"My husband decided to give it a try this morning. Waited 15mins till his turn & to our surprise, the auntie didnt bother to ask his order at all. She continued taking care of the take away order...after 5 mins later, he gave up. Literally waiting down there for 20mins for nothing. And why you all see the Q very long. Not because of the food itself. Its because the aunty isnt good at managing Q & order plus the man inside the kitchen takes his own sweet time to prepare the food."
"Nothing to goat about. Stuck up owner and helper! Imagine dry mee pok with ketchup!!!! Is expensive and the portion is miserable. The other stall inside the hawker centre is much better, in term of taste, value for money and services."
Long queue. Slow service. $5.50 for a small (2 small fishballs?!)
"Have been eating this mee pok for years.  They have a very well blended chilli and noodles are qq.

These days I usually tabao home and so I order dry kway teow.  This way the sauce gets soaked into the kway teow when I reach home and makes the noodles tastier than if it was meepok. I like the little bits of lardons that are hidden in there. Fish cake is fresh tasting and the minced pork is well blended.  The slices of pork can sometimes be dry, but tastes good nonetheless.  I usually order small which is filling for me, but does not come with prawn, which is only available from medium bowls onwards.

Taste wise noodles here is perfect old school, original, a perfect 5 or perfect 10, but I cannot give a perfect score as a pet peeve I noticed from many is how slow the line moves as the cook often deviates from making the noodles to count his prawns, or splash water on his work area.  (A bit OCD).  The lady order taker is also loud and gruff and some might misunderstand her to be rude, as she often cuts people off when they are ordering even though it's their turn to order as she is not ready to take the order until some magic moment only known to her.  Despite this, I still faithfully line up to order again, hoping she does not snap at me."
"Lady managing the stall is disgusting. There was no proper q line. Although I was in front I was asked to q from the back. Not eating anymore. Price ranged from $5.50 for small to $8.50 large, not worth eating."
"Hidden gem in Marine Parade , ingredients were fresh and porklard crispy . On par with many famous Meepok out there .
Only felt that my Mee Pok is slightly over cooked and little soggy , else it's a perfect bowl !"
"Took the $6.50 (medium size portion) of Mee Pok. On the overalls is delicious and old school style bak chor mee. Chili is great, the soup is good and the bah por is good.

Just feel the fish balls are smaller in size. But they give a good size prawn.

For myself, I definitely recommended to come back again."
Standard drop liao. But better than most mall food.
"First time, healthy way of serving. No msg but good tasty noodle."
"NEW: 2  Not really getting anything here other than nostalgia.. the meepok is so limp.. It's so disappointing.. this is the end of the line of this legendary Siglap mee pok man stall.

OLD: 3  Oh.. how heavy is the weight of nostalgia? This was the original Siglap ""mee pok man"" (currently in its 2nd generation), having operated 40+ years ago in one of the cooked food stalls at the old Siglap Market which my granny brought me every week. I've followed them each time they moved location, but the determination to keep up and keep coming dwindled over time - because the quality has diminished as well. That signature noodle texture/ gloss is missing, so is that punchy chilly that used to make me sweat with a smile. How I wish things don't change so much, well, for this at least."
"I'm giving 2 stars because of the friendly brother making the noodles.
But that's all there is to it.
I'm an avid noodle eater and I love meepok.
Ordered a traditional meepok medium.
I think as a stall that holds so much history. They really"" have to look at some comments and realize how much they have gone under.

The noodles are clamy and mushy.
Taste is very mediocre, not tasty enough and no vinegar taste at all.
Fish balls and the soup are very normal"".

It's not even as good as a nameless meepok stall.
I appreciate the guy cooking and I think he's trying his best. But something went wrong some where.
He's got to relook and experiment on his forefather's recipe.
Just really sad"
I dun understand why this stall is so famous. The noodle is so so. I have eaten much better ones. They are very slow in serving even there's only 2 person in front. Personally I don't feel the noodles is good. Once is enough
"Fish Ball Noodles (SGD $5.50) @ 132 Traditional Teochew Noodles.
.
Now into the 54th year since their founding in 1969, this renowned stall is helmed by the 2nd generation owners, a proud Chinese Teochew bastion where they insist on using the freshest ingredients.
.
That pride also translates into a respectable wait, as each bowl is prepared to order, taking around 5 minutes or so per bowl. Expect to queue for at least 20 minutes.
.
Portions are generous, and the mee pok / wide flat egg noodles are properly al-dente, with their secret chili lending a savoury salty spicy kick, and just enough oil to prevent sticking.
.
The freshness of the minced pork shines with meaty sweet savoury notes, while the the crisp bean sprouts lend a hint of vegetal sweet flavour. The bouncy fish balls and springy fish cake carry mild savoury sweet flavour.
.
Completed with slippery her giao / fish dumpling, and a warm soup on the side."
"Used to be better, the texture of the noodle is softer than before. I used to like the more al dente version, which I fondly remember. Ingredients are still fresh, but the physical queuing system needs some improvement now that they accept online orders. You can end up standing and waiting for longer when there is an online order before your turn."
Bad food slow service
"Been eating here the past 13 years or so since I was first introduced and I genuinely feel like the taste and texture etc are still very consistent so i'm shocked that so many people giving it a 1-star. My favorite Mee Pok in the entire Singapore and yes, i've tried plenty (the rest tastes more or less the same). Dine in is the best way to have it. Kicks different"
Not sure why they don't get a better rating but it's definitely 1 of the better meepok in the east. Queues are a constant and the smallest portion starts at $4.50. But they cook the noodles just right and the chili is simply spot on. Well worth a visit if you're in the neighborhood I promise.
"Ordered the mee pok dry black sauce. The mee pok has an alkaline taste. Yucks.
Dunno why there's always a long queue here. The same noodles at the hawker centre next door is so much better!"
The food is yummy . Definitely worth the Q or wait. Though the wait may be long and the area is clean and tidy.
"They are supposed to be the OG recipe holders of the Tua Kong Mee Pok branches. Also the distant relatives of the famous Lao Lim Mee Pok. Its edible but not the best amongst those who carry the Tua Kong flag.

What's appalling is the crazy wait. With a lot of redundant rituals, the second gen hawker will take around 5-8mins to make a bowl of noodles. Need to have a lot of patience to try their fare. I'll bail!"
"Queue was kind of slow but shop was a one man show and that probably explains.
Noodle was tasty and chill pack a good punch (at least for me) definitely worth trying if are around the area."
"Nice Singaporean meepok (local version of fettucine), complete with dollop of spicy chili, fried shallots and morsels of lard!

Warning: Pretty spicy on the palate.  Strong and bold flavour profile!

How to eat it?
1) Mix the noodles properly until you'd get an even colour
2) a mouthful of noodles and meat
3) a mouthful of soup  (warning: this brings the whole mouthful of noodle to another level of spiciness and flavours!)
4) repeat

Cons:
1) spicy (only a con if you can't take spicy)
2) long wait - wait is longer now
3) some might find it too salty"
14 Jul 2022: Ordered mee pok dry from 132 TRADITIONAL TEOCHEW NOODLES and we went home feeling satisfied. Nice combination of the sauce and chilli and it sure is a nice comfort food. The soup is a little salty for me and the best time to try this old school mee pok would be after 1pm.
"The best time to eat this is probably after 1pm. When we went at 12 plus, there were only a few persons ahead but the wait was 20 minutes.

I'm not sure if I was famished after exercising or what but I thought this was a really yummy bowl of noodles. The noodles was al dente and soaked up the flavourful sauce. The soup on the side seemed a tad salty, so I reckon it is probably laden with MSG.

I ordered the small bowl at $4.50, so the ingredients were a tad skimpy with just 2 fishballs, 1 fish dumpling, 1 thick slice of fish cake, 1 thick slice of pork, and some minced pork. My friend's medium $5.50 bowl had 2 more fishball and a prawn. So I'd probably order the medium bowl next time."
"3.5 stars! After looking at so many negative reviews online, I decided to give it a try. Waited for 15 mins with 5 ppl in queue, quite fast. Ordered meepok dry and kway teow noodles soup to try. The soup version is your average fishball noodles you can find anywhere. However, if you are looking for a challenge, try their dry version, I consider myself quite a chilli eater but I nearly melted finishing this bowl of dry meepok. My lips were swollen and sweat is dripping down my back...my verdict, if you wanna try wait till there's no queue."
"Everything has slack, too spicy & oily, the cashier attitude not so happy when i ask for tomato ketchup...not going back!"
Very bad service. Owners think they are a big deal and only cares about chatting and not preparing noods. Q moves soo slowly Coz of their inefficiency! No big deal!
"Can eat, but not a must eat unless you have craving for a normal bowl of meepok, chilli and noodles texture is not bad, the rest is normal, will skip if there's a queue."
"Sadly the quality has dropped. The noodles are soggy and mushy. The two fish balls are comically small. And the overall portion for the ($4.50 or small size) is really comically small. I know there's inflation, but this is quite extreme"
It is ok. Expect to wait though. The store does take care to prepare each bowl
"Used to patron them alot in the past.
But its getting really bad now...

Noodles not Al-Dente anymore. More like mushy noodle mess. Ask for Xiao La and it was still bloody spicy. For what I am not sure.. Fishballs not fresh for sure.

Another pet peeve was the slow queue... I mean, if you have such a crowd then perhaps spend abit of money to get a queue system so pple can sit down and wait? And get another helper to quicken the preparation of the food process... And DON'T accept Grabfood/Foodpanda orders if you can't even clear the physical queue... Wth. I think i order from gradfood is faster than queuing up honestly. Last but not least, super dirty trays. Disrespecting your loyal supporters imo.

I'm all for supporting locals but making us suffer for supporting you? Then no go...

Today's 1 and a half hour wait was a last straw. Will never patronize again after a decade of eating their food."
This man is v slow and hence longer queue. The woman is fast to take your order but cannot remember what u ordered. I would prefer she don't ask until my turn. Not very friendly. It's not worth to waste time on this
"Chan's Mee Pok is probably the best in Singapore. Always a queue, but worth the wait."
"I rate now as above average. Not in the past with Must eat. The Auntie is still the same & the pace of cooking is extremely slow. With s mindset of you want to eat you have to wait.  No more
The passion or urgency of 10 years ago
Has disappeared. A kind of disappointed."
A total disappointment. Noodles were not cooked properly
I am a regular patron
First and last time for me. You can get as good or better fishball noodles from other places. Customer service is bad.
Good chilli
"Yes it is a good noodle place...
But it is a mom & pop shop which is seriously slow - need to wait over an hour just for a bowl of noodles. Still living in the past."
"I've eaten this meepok for years and hope to continue to eat it for years to come.

Be wary of the long queue and cook time. The Aunty will take your order only after she's said the pevious one, so be patient.

The meepok texture is great and the chilli always to be enjoyed. Its soup is flavourful with great ingredients and fishballs that are on the harder side.

The kway teow mee is also good, with the kway yeow being on the slightly thicker side."
I went at close to 3pm so only a few in line. Noodles were painstakingly prepared as such had to wait for him to get my 3 pkts of takeaway done.
Nothing special. Take long time to cook a bowl. Estimate 5-10 mins wait between bowl to bowl. Seems the chef waits till there is a long queue then he starts to cook the next bowl.
"Wei Dao Bu Cuo,Ke Xi Mian You Dian Ku"
"The noodles tastes awful. Can't consider as teochew noodles. There are better teochew noodles than theirs. The auntie there also has attitude problem. I asked for cut red chillis, she just scooped and pour it into the orange plastic bag, not even into the noodles. Lousy service and unhygienic!!"
Bad customer experience and disagree the Mee Pok is that great as described.
Simple pathetic. Food was awful. The aunty taking orders just makes you wait forever without making eye contact. I would avoid this place. The Sunday Newspaper article from yonks ago is misleading - I'd go somewhere else
Very flavorful chili sauce for their dry meepok
"The original vinegar-less Teochew noodle in the East! Lau Lim & Ah Lim are both originated from 132. This is the original!

Highlight is the sauce for meepok, loaded with lard yet in a perfectly balanced way. Ingredients wise nothing to shout about, standard fares.

Wait could be long, be patient.

Meepok was a tart over cooked though. Still very good fishball noodle to go after."
Grimey chopsticks and spoons. Dangerous during a pandemic.
"Waiting time was a tad long given only 2 customers ahead of me. Guess the uncle was a little slow. The old auntie who took my order was also rather curt and impolite with me. Frankly I wasn't even sure what there is to order. I just assumed it was either meepok or kwayteow because those were the only items on display so I told her I'd like to have a kway teow and she was immediately curt and impolite with me giving me a tone as she started asking if I'd like to have chili in it and if I'm having it to go. Like chill? I wasn't rude so I really don't appreciate the attitude and negativity. It wasn't rush hour and no one was behind me. Of course, she immediately changed tone and was all friendly when she served the caucasian man after me who wasn't even speaking mandarin. Well the noodles wasn't shabby actually. Rather tasty as it was spammed with tomato sauce. Heh. Nothing too fancy or outstanding. The food tray looked old and grubby. I like that there was chili padi available. Guess I'm not  patronising again no thanks to grouchy auntie."
Miss the good old taste .  Yum Yum.
Always good.
Open today on Christmas Day! This is hands down my favourite Teochew Mee Pok in SGP. Just be prepared to wait. He does take his time in the prep of each bowl. It's worth the wait.
Very rude old lady and very slow service. Food is good but sometimes it not just all abt the food quality. If the old lady is so unhappy then don't be in the service line up spoil everyone's day.
Above average noodles. On the oily side. Tasteless factory made fish balls. Come here only for noodles and chilli. Rest not worth your time
Waited 20 mins to get a noodle from hawker.. the son lost the skill from his father
Somehow i recall it to be tastier...
Many repeated visit. The noodles is good and the ingredients are always so fresh.  Oh ya the soup is also very tasty too.
"Good old style Teochew Mee Poh, but prepare to wait cos uncle quite slow, making one bowl at a time. If got grab order come in, wait longer !"
29Mar20 Their dried Mee poh nothing special to mention ; very ordinary.  1 to 10 I gave a 4. May be their soup would be better. Will not go back.
Excellent dry mee pok with potent chilli... absolutely love it
"0ne of the best place to savour one of our
Singapore prized dish... Mee pok with the fiery
Chilli complete with fresh ingredients and
A taste of teochew soup goodness."
"Surprise to find a short queue and decide to go for it. Only to realise you need to pay first on the right with the elderly lady. Btw, she decides when to take  your order.

Food standard drop or maybe there are other options which tastes similar. The mee pok is tasty but average at best compares with others such as Joo Chiat (the kopi shop beside Killiney).

Wait is around 10-15mins for a queue of 3 pax in front of you."
"It is truly one of the best mee pok in Singapore. The kway teow soup is good too, my son loves it. Don't pay attention to the rubbish reviews."
I would say that a lot of the other Tua Kong places have caught up in terms of flavour but the difference here is that the noodles are perfectly done... Springy and will wonderfully al dente.
"If you are in the area and need something to eat, you can try this. But pls don't drive all the way here just to try this."
Good traditional fare in a modern stiing.
"Not recommended .buy a SG,6 kway tiao noodles .looks like sg4 noodles . overpriced and noodles is not that nice also"
The staff was snobbish and arrogant. The noodles was on the expensive side and the taste was not to my expectations. Not worth queuing for it actually. I've tasted better!
"Queue wasn't long at 8am. Asked for little spicy but found whole chunk of chilli mixed inside, the taste of mee pok is overpowered by the chilli itself, couldn't taste anything else. Maybe it was good in the past but every other mee pok stalls is either the same or better now. Come and queue for chilli if you like."
"Overrated. Incredibly slow and the auntie is terrible at customer service. The guy makes his food so slowly, which would be justified if the food was incredible. It's just alright. Only eat if there's no queue."
This stall used to be at Jalan Tua Kong Coffee shop.  This guy cooking is damn slow.  He just taking his time own sweet time.  He just don't  bother to serve the customer fast. Overrated reviews and overpriced.
The chilli not to be miss.. Expect queue on weekends.
Nice n good price
Over rated many times over.
"If you are willing to stand in line and suffer the brusque lady taking your order, the mee pok is worth the while."
Each order is prepared individually bowl by bowl to ensure quality; no mass production. Generous amount of crispy pork lard. The noodle is springy and soft.
"This is probably the first food stall that I have given just one star and it fully deserved it. Saw its review on Burpple and decided to give it a try. To be honest, the meepok was really overrated. Firstly, the noodle has this very strong alkaline taste that is so overpowering and i couldn't taste anything else."
Go to place for mee pok!
NIce place
Affordable price but you get what you pay for so it's not as good
Deliciously traditional.
Great noodle shop! Go for it !
"His chilli sauce has hae bee (I think) content which gives it a special flavour n his mee pok is soft which I like. Those who prefer al dente texture, tell him so .. he can reduce blanching time"
Noodles are nice with chilli! Sauce goes well with the noodles. Soup is sweet with prawn and meat taste! Woohoo! Would visit again
"Best mee pok in Singers. The chewy noodles, fresh ingredients, taste of chilli and soup were simply well balanced and delicious."
"i did not visit this place, i was actually picking up horfun from the adjacent place.
132 got very long q and the food is overprised and over rated. the old lady behind the cashier should stay at home and rest.
last time i attempted to get some food and pay for it she totally ignored me like i was transparent.
i will never buy a single meal there for he rest of my life."
"Great tasting noodles, chilli paste and most of all, the soup.  Best soup ever, keeps me coming back."
"Noodle al dente, chilli sauce was flavorful. Ingredients were good in general, one of the better fish dumplings I've had at fishball noodles stores. In the midst of a neighborhood. Worth a try if staying nearby"
Over rated stall. What's so special compared to other noodles stalls? Food is ordinary and also had to queue.. 
Tasty love it
Its nice but too small a bowl for $5.
Consistently good Bak Chor mee pok but they don't sell mee Kia. Comparable to Tua Kong noodle but slightly cheaper. But take note of arrogant seller
Better than the rest and price reasonable
"Best of the best, should try, my top priority list."
Zhu Tai Man Liao
"Good. But nothing to shout about. There are many such Mee Pok in the East of the Island, let alone the whole island"
Delicious $4 -$6
Over rated. Not worth the queue
Slow and steady yummy. Superb. Rare nostalgic taste. Thicker mee pok aldente.
"2nd generation hawker who took over from his father. Quality is consistent. Serving is small, arrogant seller. Taste a bit better than it looks. Works rather slowly so expect to queue even at off peak times. Not worth the wait at peak time imho"
Very salty & noodles normal
Disappointing portions. Have since switched to ah lim meepok at Tanah merah
Superb food.
Great meepok
Arrogance in its service. Would avoid it. I was enjoying the char siew stall that is next to it.
"The noodles were springy the ingredients were fresh, the chili was spicy and delicious."
If you are a Teochew Fishball Noodle enthusiasts.. U must try it!
Taste is ok but too long a wait. Queue is actually not long but somehow wait is super long.
Delicious and still as fabulous
"Definitely not worth your while. There's much better Mee Pok elsewhere. Attitude is bad, service is slower than it ought to be."
Over-rated. Only open half day.
"Grouchy service, long wait."
Noodle hard
"Poor and unfriendly service by lady boss.  Slow in cooking and purposely create queue. Easily one of the lousiest mee pok in town. Fishball is not fresh. Not worth wasting calorie on such lousy food. Any mee pok stall in bedok and around the island will beat this stall flat. Highly not recommended. I rated one star because it does not allow me to put review unless you rate minimum one star. That is really pathetic
."
Best chilli sauce in town.
Simply the best!!!! I highly recommend this place for breakfast!
Still the best Mee Pok .. taste is different from the usual .. 5 star
"Looking at the arrogant face of the lady boss, I also lost appetite. Portions are ridiculously small and it is way overpriced. Highly NOT recommended."
"Small portion for min 4 dollars. Nothing really fantastic either. I think the soup is what makes it popular in the first place. More ""fragrant"" soup than other noodle sellers."
"Expensive yet not really that good. The price has recently gone up, minimum order is $4.00 (ranges from $4 to $6)."
"According to some sources, this is the original Jalan Tua Kong meepok. I tried it once, pretty good. Similar to the one at Simpang Bedok. Queue is shorter."
The best in town
Mee Pok made the traditional way.
Arrogant lady boss. Drastic increase in price. Very small portions. Not worth eating.
Food is good. Waiting time is horrendous.
Delicious kway teow and my favorite carrot cake in Singapore! The auntie is also very kind and hard-working. I go here every time I am in the area 
Friendly old auntie. I ordered fried hokkien prawn noodles $5.50. Comes with hot chilli and pork lard. Ingredients taste pretty fresh for a hawker centre. Shiok gravy and thicken as I eat. Should have packed home and let the gravy soaked into the noodles.
"Simply divine, added chili and hockien mee is best combo ever! Every mouth is burst with favour !"
"The auntie was very friendly.

The fried oyster (Ci Jian) and char kway Teow was very nice. The oyster was quite fresh too. Portion is on the slightly generous side.

The hokkien mee was quite good too.

Do note that the stall is closed on weekends."
"Hokkien Mee (SGD $5) @ Stall 28 / 28 Fried Kway Teow.
.
This stall makes the list for serving over 20 years or more, and their 'wet' style is rather nostalgic for me.
.
Their noodles are cut short, soft and slippery, tossed with fluffy egg and crisp bean sprouts, soaked with gravy for mild grainy sweet savoury salty eggy flavour.
.
The tender pork belly is nicely fatty with succulent meaty savoury salty flavour, while both squid chunks and deshelled prawn are tender springy with sweet savoury flavour.
.
Some spring onions lend vegetal herbal sweet flavour, and a drizzle of lime juice lends zesty tangy sour notes. Less wok hei / breath of the wok, and the pork lard alternates limp and crisp."
"Ordered fried oyster. The lady owner seems to be doing business solely. Ordered and was told to take a buzzer. Waited abt 10mins.
The oysters were fresh and plump. $6.80"
Ordered delivery. The black carrot cake tasted fine but was all mushy and had absolutely no crispy or eggy bits or anything that resembles good black carrot cake. It looked like it had no eggs. Strange. The fried oysters had more starch than fried eggs and tasted strangely dull. The bean sprouts tasted very charred and burnt and was not good. This stall is not for me.
Closes much earlier by 10. Don't waste your time
"Char Kway Teow is more savory than sweet. Unfortunately it lacks wok hei and flavor. The ingredients are limited. Forgettable.

Hokkien Mee was a pleasant surprise. It came with 3 sea prawns which were fresh and of excellent flavor. Also came with pork belly, squid, chive and pork lard. The noodle mix was cooked well and the chili was top notch, slightly sweet and balance of prawn paste which gave it an umami lift. 4.5*

The hygiene of this hawker center is less than desirable."
"Ordered thru Foodpanda, CKT came in one big lump, dry and tasteless. Quite disappointed the second time."
Nice prawn omelette
Hokkien mee is good
"The char kway tiao cmi.... bland and tasteless... for a store called ""28 fried kway teow""..... 0 pride taken in the dish.... oyster omelette is good."
a week eat food few time 
Craving for the real fried Kway Teow. Found this stall on google. Just had the fried kway teow. It is the authentic Fried Kway Teow that is so difficult to find nowadays! Deserve more than a 5 stars!
Great char kuay teow!!
"Very good hokkien mee, black carrot cake and cockles beansprouts. Good wok hei on the carrot cake and not too sweet. Hokkien mee tasted lighter than most but I enjoyed it. Cockles gave a nice saltiness to the beansprouts. Friendly staff."
The black carrot cake is excellent.
"Char kuay teow is average, tasty but not much 'wok hey'. The hokkien mee is disappointingly bland and watery."
Super yummy. Been eating Susan's carrot cake & char Kway teow for years. She's the best. Makes her food so delicious. Full of flavor. And she's so generous with all her ingredients. Love it!!
We had the oyster omelette and dabao the fried kueh Teow.  I liked the taste of the fried kueh Teow better owner and helper were very friendly folks
Love this stall. Do try their char kway teow without kway Teow! :) Low carb option
"Probably one of the best Orh Lua or Oyster Omelette I had in quite awhile. Crispy fried edges and non greasy flour, thick and succulent, juicy Oyster in a flavourful mix of delicious wok hei. You will be surprised your delicious omelette fried by a youngster yet handled the plate of Oyster heaven like an experience hawker with decades of experience. Much described here is their char kway teow and carrot cake, probably next time. But for one, the oyster omelette is definitely five stars. Shown here is the $10 portion. Will be back"
"The carrot cake was fresh, supple and well fried with generous amounts of chai poh. One of the better ones I've tasted in terms of texture, moisture and not overpowering with the amount of black sauce used. Plus points for adding an extra egg upon request as not all stalls accede."
"I didn't want to wait and decided to order from foodpanda pickup. I received an alert that the food is almost ready for pickup, but it wasn't in the wok and I think they mixed up my order (Foodpanda Vs Grabfood) I told her that I want to dine in and she didn't reply or confirm my order. Minutes later the uncle gave me a takeaway pack. I just highlighted that I mentioned dine in and I didn't insisted to have serve on a plate but he throw the takeaway bag on the cutlery tray. I didn't bother to argue with him and walked away to find a table. She came to my table and gave me a lesson. She told me not to order from Grab next time and order from her directly as they need to pay extra fee and I have to pay extra fee. I been there few times and never ordered from the stall. They need to understand without the convenient of food apps, I won't order from the stall. Taste average and won't go back again!"
Generous portion of CKT. The kway teow is fried decently. Waited for close to 20mins for my plate.
"Horrible attitude. Every time I order I wait for 30 minutes. One time she even forgot my order... but then when I ask about whether this time she forgets, she always says ""cooking"" in a very rude way as if I am not allowed to ask. Also, the uncle use plastic plate as cooking ware... Isn't that hazardous?"
"Popular quick carbo meal in various kind fried noodles or rice for eating or take away. Fast service, cook when ordered."
"Drinks store aunty very very rude , she is always wearing a cap . The coffee she made not nice .. terrible . And try the tea also very bad . Try not to  Dgo to the store when the aunty is there . Bad !"
"Pretty cooling location
Food is very decently priced"
"Wei ji duck store closed down.

Recently there is a wonton store and ban mian (marsiling) store opened here, both are very good and reasonably priced.

Environment is ok"
"I usually come here for cai png, braised duck kuayteow mee and wanton mee. Good chatting spot for people working nearby during lunch time or tea break."
I'm impressed by The Zhonghua stall selling Chinese or rather China style mixed vegetables rice. The mala cabbage and other dishes are impressive and I'm pleasantly surprised by the good taste.
"Nice food Place, especially the Chinese Mixed Rice with very long Queue during lunch time"
The wei ji duck noodles are value for money at $3 each (what a steal) and their mutton briyani (with two vegetables) are about $7. The food here is superb!
Food is nice here
Not sure its not open when i reach there?
The place quite secluded but the food is not.Spices n taste is 4 star and the portion is applauded.staff aka chef is frenly.Zas is d stall name.Thumbs up.
"Food nicely and good price.
#Thaifood"
"Came in evening, tried the Thai food. Wow!!!"
Reasonably clean coffee shop with decent varieties of food stalls.
"The Indian drink stall at the first roll , first stall selling hot n cold drinks. The Chinese aunty who helps and assist the stall boss in charge of making drink n other stuff are very friendly n polite. I can said is the best n approach people that always serve customers with a smile n polite manner. Keep it up n thumb up."
I love noodles therr
"There are lots of choices for food. I ordered the famous wonton mee for breakfast, which was really nice. Many people just queued up patiently and waited for their bowls."
"Best Macha latte, fish soup bee hoon, western food, etc"
Excellent food at Warung Wak Nakeen. Service self service. Crowded but always there's seats available
"Its a wet market with a food centre under the same roof. Nice food Malay and Indian.. with nice mee Kia/pok and Fried carrot cake. Nice place for local breakfast.
Lovely nasi lemak and prata bread at nearby coffe shop and local amenities. Good place for your hawker food and marketing. Love it!!"
The atmosphere is very relaxing and windy. Nice place to dine in even during lunch time. Its not stuffy and hot. Give it a try. Opposite is the Marine Terrace MRT station. Very convenient.
"Pretty decent hawker fare. Generally clean and comfortable place for a meal. The today (only on weekends), nasi ambeng and fishbowl stalls are very good"
"Decided to head down to this quiet but at the same time lively old folks town to try out the recent trendy matcha shop that is located within the market called Corner Shop.

There are a lot of food choices to choose from, and I decided to eat the mee pok from 132 traditional teochew mee pok ($4, $5, $6) there. The noodles are quite springy and chewy with a nice kick of spice from the chili. 4/5 as the noodle felt a bit too floury, kinda feels a little undercooked, but nonetheless, it still tasted good.

For drinks, I got the Ice Matcha Latte ($5.50 + $0.1 for takeaway). The matcha was traditional hand whisk with the cha sen and matcha bowl. The taste, astringency, and mouthfeels wise are okay to me as there are much better matcha places out there, but for the price point of $5.50, I felt it was good enough as it is in the hawker centre so no complains on that. They do sell traditional nan yang coffee too from Yong Seng, a traditional nan yang coffee distributor in singapore. Will try it next time if I have the chance to.

Verdict : I would go back again if I'm near the area but won't specifically make my way down if im from somewhere far away."
Great Malay food
"Veggie store run by Spencer and Alvin, has very good quality and variety. Love the fresh veggies from Australia, Taiwan. And their fruit are super esp Aomori Apples if in season. Papaya and grapes very high quality. I don't mind paying the price for good stuff- family enjoy them so much. Good job Spencer.. they are located near the hawker centre towards the centre of the market..it is a small market. Sorry cannot give a better description"
Economical and affordable spread of food available;  but it is a very noisy and rowdy place at the hawker center.
Nice affordable hawker food
"food wise good variety, hawker service has dropped"
There for the kopi stall - great thick coffee
"Nice place and experience. Fantastic Coffee , Egg & Toast Bread"
"Very expensive meal.
Hawkers staff not helpful to wheelchair handicap.
Atmosphere is now getting more hot"
Good variety of food choices for breakfast. Market quite comprehensive too.
Meeting place breakfast eggs with coffee  $3.40 Affordable marine trannce station hawker centre
Have a variety of nice food
Would recommend the noodle (132 meepok and the other fishball facing the main road )
"There are two stalls side by side and I have the opportunity to taste both, surprisingly the one on the left with lesser queue is superior in terms of taste and value. Gist is don't be blindsided by the queue. "
Traditional hawker centre besides wet market
Unexpected but awesome local craft beer options at The Cornershop beer and coffee stall.
"Wei Dao Bu Cuo,Jie Qian Hen He Li,Ke Yi Yong CDC Li Juan E,Zan "
Price is on the high side for a hawker centre.   There are some nice food..but its a bit expensive if I compared with other hawker centre in the east.
Worth visiting and will visit again.
The hawker fare offered changed regularly; the new fried carrot cake and fried hokkien prawn noodle is now gone. The fish ball noodles come highly recommended remains. Next to it is the highly edible hor fun stall although they offer a fair variety of other cze char stuff.
No many food to choose
Not clean. Birds scavenging on left over food.
Well maintained hawker centre and wet market.
Love this place early in the morning.
"For an old established market with new progression in daily requirement for the well known old estate, this market has a great sense for the people in the estate."
"More expensive than prices in the Northside, at least one dollar more, don't know how residents survive Southeast? Should vote for Opposition in coming GE and to vote PAP Tan See Leng out!"
"Amazing bcm, soon kuay, chee Chong fan, long tong"
Get drinks from the Indian drink store at the back! Very very nice Teh Halia and Lemon Juice
"Could not find a listing for this new outlet 'Chang Thai Food', but I must post this as I enjoyed the Thai basil pork rice with drippy bullseye egg.  It's very good for a quick tabao for lunc.  There were orders before me but took them only abou 8 min to cook my 2 orders fresh.  Very good taste and portion.  Highly recommended."
Busy during Lunar Chinese new year. And a bit quiet in other days
"Basically a Hawker Centre
With many interesting Food served here
Residents meet up place for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner.
With Amber car parking spaces
And very close to a MRT station @ TEL / Brown Line by 1st Half 2024 (June 2024)"
Localised food centre and wet market.
"So, the former owner of Chee Cheong Fun closed their stall, but luckily, a new owner has stepped in to fill the void. The new CCF is very different compared to its predecessor. Firstly, the waiting time has significantly reduced from the previous establishment (having been an institution in the community for many years and beloved by everyone) since they're new and replacing the old reliable stall. Secondly, the current owner's CCF aligns perfectly with my preferences. It boasts a smoother, lighter, and fluffier texture compared to the previous one (which was much denser and grainier since they milled their own rice flour on the spot). I highly recommend giving them a try if you're around the neighborhood."
Love the fried carrot cake and minced pork noodles.
Back in young time. Love the environment and feeling
Hawker Centre with plenty of choices!
Price expensive and nothing to eat.
Newly upgraded market
"Lontong, mee Siam,  vegetarian food "
"The market is open after 2-3 months renovation!!!!
Pictures taken on 20th Oct 2023 Friday 0800 hrs"
This hawker center is a bit run down and thankfully is now closed for renovation. Stay tune for the reopening on 3 Oct 2023. Unfortunately some stalls such as the famous Chee Cheong Fun and porridge will be permanently closed and not return anymore.
The place is A bit hot
Many options for halal and non halal foods.
Small food place with limited food options. Few gems around this place.
I like the market which may be small but is well stocked with organic vegetables. Seafood variety is good too but the prices maybe a bit steep.
The hor fun store is good
"Very nice tasty and generous servings at affordable prices. Most food stalls are sold-out and shuttered after 1.30pm.  However, the famous noodle/fish soup stall remains open until 9.00pm"
Nice vegetarian and Muslim food here. But small selection
"Both wet market and food fare is located next to each other.
You can a good variety of local favorites like fried carrots cake, fish ball noodles. I tried San Lo Sliced Fish for $6. Situated at 2nd stall from the left as you enter from the main road. Generous portions abd the fish is freshly cooked."
Good and tasty bean curd drinks.
Small place for breakfast and lunch only.
Mee Siam is good and cheap
"I grew up and still growing old with this neighbourhood. Of course it's the best place in SG for me  however, sadly most food stall no longer exist, really miss Ah Leong fishball noodle, porridge, fried carrot cake etc. Those that is there are the newer operators."
Place short of sitting table and chair
"This is a very old hawker center but serve one of the best malay longtong. The gravy is so authentic because it got young nanka in it and so rich, and generous serving. The stall name is ole ole bumble"
"Had kueh kueh ($4.10) & kopi-O ($1.00) for breakfast, was ok. Hawker Centre is a bit cramped & tired, time to spruce up."
Too many obstruction in the wet market. Horrible and unprofessional management.
"Food centre ventilation cool, not crowded, wash room clean n FOC ."
Most stalls are open in the morning.  Some legendary stalls like the Tanjong Rhu Wanton Mee etc
"Wow! All the time fresh products and smiles traders. :) Noisy  but lovely place. Working only till 1.00 PM. Hurry up,  guys!"
Coffee stall don't serve hot drinks from 730pm. Limited stalls except for Zhizhar stall and carrot cake are opened.
"Best food here.
- Vegetarian Bee Hoon
- Nonya Kueh
- Longtong
- Teh Tarik

Pretty good but not the best
- Carrot Cake
- You Tiao and Butterfly
- Chee Cheong Fun
- Fish ball Noodles

Special mention to the beancurd store for friendliness and great customer service."
Limited options past noon.
Love the chicken rice here as it's frangance and nice! Been eating here for years
went there for breakfast saturday a bit crowded old school
"6 months ago, I provided the below feedback.
The situation is still the same. I was hoping the the RC or Town Council will review and get the relevant agencies to improve the situation. Residents here have to q for 20 mins just to get their drinks! Hope to see 1 - two more

Not convenient for residents!!
This is probably the only hawker centre with only two chinese drink stalls and one Muslim drink stall. Usually one of these 3 are closed. Hope NEA will allow more drink stalls to reduce long  queue and possible infection, especially over crowding in the centre."
Many stalls were not open. Esp the popular foodstalls.
Marine terrace hawker cent not up to standed very dirty an measse the coffee shop and restroom very smelle an dirty stand drop
"I went at around 1pm to grab some food for myself. When I walked in, it truly feels like the place is haunted because all the stalls are closed except for like 5 or 6 stalls. And even if they are opened, they're either out of food already or they are not willing to serve you because they don't take any other kinds of payment other than cash... Poor experience!"
Li just go there to eat the appam
Food ok... But some sellers quite arrogant
"Wanton mee only opens on certain days wed to weekends. Le Le ban mian, the best you can ever get, has closed. Still worth coming for home made Chee cheong fun and beef horfun and bake chor/ fishball noodles."
Expensive food...
Normal hawker fare. Avoid mornings. Crowded and warm . Porridge stall and one Malay stall named Oneh Oneh was good !
One of the popular hawker centres in the East. There are 2 carparks leading up to this hawker centre. Lunch time will be very busy.
"Neighborhood gem
Lots of varieties of food & shop mix
Awesome"
Alot to choose from
"Small, limited stalls. Accidentally walked towards the non halal tray return station and the cleaner shouted at me several time before I was even close. I told him that there was no need to scream and he used a profanity on me. Good to know that the cleaners are so entitled."
Small but ok
Great place. Fish ball noodles there taste good
Love their Chee cheong fun and porridge
Good place to pickup your groceries. The hawker center is very useful with good variety of food.
Nice and cooling place
Lots of food selection. Something for everyone.
Great lontong and dishes with rice. Some new stalls with chwee kuay snd others gone
Small market with hawker centre. Fishball noodle and hor fun stalls worth the try but prices  of the stalls doesn't fit the hawker centre price. Keeps increasing $
nice place for coffee.
"28 Mar 2022: You have plenty of choices for freshly made chee cheong fun from YONG HUAT DELIGHT...the turnip filling came out well for me and it goes well with the savory sauce. They also served pretty good porridge...smooth comfort food.

09 Feb 2022: TASTE OF TRADITION...nice flavorful Hokkien mee; great taste and loaded with ingredients (the sambal is a little weak...I prefer to have more kick). The oyster omelette is nice too; not too oily and it's crispy on the outside but soft inside...Yummy!

27 Nov 2021: Packed with nice choices and I ordered lontong from OLE OLE BUMBU. Very satisfying breakfast......super shiok, rich and creamy gravy, top up with anchovy sambal and serunding. Yummy comfort food and the best in the East."
Nice place
Bought Nasi Padang home to eat for lunch. Nice but a bit expensive.
Too many shops n all very cheap to buy.
Not a hawker centre to go to for dinner. Only 2 stalls open when I last visit 2 days ago. Morning & lunch time are still fine. This hawker centre is small don't expect much. Fried carrot cake which Joesph Schooling patronised is at this hawker centre
"Lookout for the Handmade Chee Cheong Fun in the morning by Yong Huat Delights.

Their Chee Cheong Fun got a range of varieties and my personal favourite is the one with Ku Chye and also the other one with Mang Guang(Turnips).

Coupled with their self made chilli, I loved and enjoyed my 1st meal of the day.

If you like porridge to go along, my choice for the day will be the meatball porridge. There's a tangy taste to the meatball and it's not over powering, try it.

This is my go to place whenever I got craving for our local rice rolls.

Plenty of carpark lots behind the HDB blocks and even if raining also no worries, got a MSCP by the side."
The Malay culinary food there is very popular and by 1400hrs most are sold out. The other food by other vendors also seems to be popular.
"Hen Duo Xuan Ze,You Tai Guo Can,Zhu Chang Fen He Zhou!Kan Shang Qu Hen Mei Wei!"
Good experience...
There is a.market and a food ctre for the residents and others visiting. Nearby are row of shops and Giant supermarket.
Local goodness. Nice food at reasonable prices
"The only food court at Marine Parade, the are is  spacious next to the only one Shopping Mall Parkway Parade."
There are many kinds of foods. Raw and fast food to buy
"A variety of cooked food,uncooked  dried food for cooking beside plants and fresh flowers for decor and as gifts.Very interesting
!!!"
"great place to buy fresh whole fish for cooking yourself; all types; and the vegetables are super also; there is also pork, chicken available here. Come early opens 730am no matter what you see on web. Several shops for small items also, fruits."
Ren Chao Xiong Yong Bu Cuo Ba Cha Qing Ji Wei Sheng
"I love this Xing Long Lor Mee in 50 Marine Terrace Hawker Centre cos food here is so damn cheap and better still, sooooo sadap delicious, better than restaurants, and and they serve ever fresh foods   after eating, I am still craving for more"
Quite and peaceful surroundings
Great tasting and value for money food options!
"Mng n Lunch, evening only few stalls catering to regulars...no complaint, good relationship."
Coffee good
Food there are cheaper than marine parade central
Quite crowded at 9am weekday. Hard to find seats. Fishball noodle is good
Love the foods
"Decent variety of food choices with ample seating, had the Chee Cheong Fun and Hokkien Mee, was fine for the price point there."
Good in the morning cos more stalls are open for business... evening time choice ate limited
It is my first time visiting.  I visited roughly afternoon and most stalls are closing or closed.  So they probably do morning to lunch hours business.  The fish ball noodles stall has endless flow of business and was indeed pretty good.
Nice Lontong
"Best food to lookout for :
1) Hong Kong Chee Cheong Fun and Porridge
2) Wanton Noodles
3) Malay Mix Rice
4) Mee.Soto
5) Mee Rebus"
Very nice fried Hokkien Mee and friendly owner. It is opposite famous Wanton mee but I was attracted by the fried garlic smell. Not regrade at all! I order small but get 3 fresh prawn and some sotong and slices meat.
Not a very environmental place
Nasi rawon the best in the East
Thai food taste good but waiting time abit long depend in timing.
Coffee is good at the market... Its my fix everymorning
Best place for food and market affordable price
A wet market for daily essentials.
"Don't  go there on Monday, most stalls are closed. Wet market especially.  Malay stalls are closed."
Parkway parades
Old town road
Small hawker centre and always packed with dinners during meal time. Wide variety of local hawker food.
Now need to scan for trace together.
Clean market n nice malay n indian food ..lots of Chinese food ..5/5
Good choices of produce at the wet market
So many things you can buy
Very neat place
Have good experience there
The display are easy and neatly done
Many hawker stalls only sell during the day. I guess they are rich enough
My favorite Yong Tao Fu stall at wet market  the fish  cake delicious
"At least 20 stores here selling all kinds of food, from made-to-order ""Chee Cheong Fun"" to carrot cake, noodle soup, fried bee hoon, youtiao, Malay food, and my favorite vegetarian bee hoon. Also long queues every day for coffee."
"A great community market, just a bit low in activity during Covid measures."
Most of the stalls have nice foods. But social distancing is not too discipline. Even saw a Chinese lady bought food and dine in despite warning from the stall owner.
I love this place because i stay here block 52 marine teres
Not much variety
"Pretty much the same good. Famous fish ball noodles.
Look out for old school biscuits shop"
Good.  But now don hv safety distance
Time to expand the market capacity. Too crowded for the neighbourhood.
"This is  a wet market cum food hawker centre selling a wide variety of meat, fish and vegetables. One can get a good selection of daily needs. Worth shopping there.

There is nothing special about the cooked food here. The chee cheong fun and breakfast stall is rude and stingy with their sauce. Most of the stalls appear to be OK.

There are 2 coffee shops nearby. Unfortunately they do not offer good selection of food. The roti prata shop is not bad. The meepok is overpriced at $6 for large, not worth the price. There are also provision, sundry and fruit shops. Some shops there are manned by very rude salesman and sales ladies. I avoid patronizing them."
"Old area with a small hawker centre, a couple of coffee shop, convenience shops and a small supermarket. Convenient for people staying around."
"Open for morning only I think. Visited afternoon, most shops are closed"
i love this mee pok. Must try! WTM nothing to shout about
"Convenient to park, lots of available space."
WTM n ole ole looks good as long Q but Kopi O Kosong @ $1.40 kind of ex
"Not a morning breakfast area. Stores opened were only wanton noodles, fishballs noodles and chee cheong fun"
Nice traditional market with hawker and wet market. The corner fishball noodle on the 1st row of the hawker was extremely good. Do expect queue if you are coming during the peak hours.
There are wide variety of foods.
Good place to do your wet marketing
"Quite long time since last visit.....the corner noodle stall was closed so had tried 2 stalls.....can't remember the names but both were at the same row at the centre of the food centre, the hand made ' chee cheong fun ' ( rice rolls ) were very nice but the other stall who sells fried bee hoon and porridge was very disappointed, their $1.50 peanut porridge barely had any peanuts or other ingredients, just pure porridge.....I rather he charged more and give more ingredients....."
always packed
Smaller market than Bedok South or Bedok Market Blk 57 with limited produce n has 4 rows of stalls. Food centre has good food but at night only certain stalls are opened n no drink stalls (so u cant get drinks there).
A very good place for lunch and dinner at a very affordable price with good servings and delicious meal. Most of the stalls will be closed by 3.00pm after a day's sale bcos they started selling as early as 4.30am
Our residential choice halal and non halal.

Hen Hao De Ba Sha
Small but many choices of cheap local food.
The hawker centre open around 5ish am for those early birds to have breakfast 
Ordered my lunch from one of the Malay shop and they were so nice to me. Gave extra food FOC. There is even water cooler near the toilet area. This place is so convenient.
"The food court has a few stalls which one would like to try. The Thai food, the fresh steam rice rolls n porridge, the lontong, the mee siam n fried dough stalls. Price reasonable n food yummy to satisfy your breakfast or brunch appetite. Down it with a nice cup of soya milk drink. Whack!"
"Nice goreng pisang, ubi kayu and fried hokkien orawn noodles"
Went to the nearest food center given by Google after ECP is under renovation. Only a few stalls open at night but the fishball fish soup stall is quite good.
"I really love the oyster omelette / hokkien mee stall here! The stall also offers oyster egg for anyone who wants to reduce carbs intake and forgo the starchy thing in the usual oyster omelette.

But let's be real, the crispy and chewy bits of the traditional oyster omelette is the best part of the dish."
Good breakfast plc
Traditional local breakfast variety of food selection choices... for e.g. the chee cheong fun adventure choices of local one and silky skin ones with prawn filling like tim sum restaurant styles... so reasonably priced too... wow - lah check it out savour your taste buds... Uncle Mike.
Hawker food average standard. Small hawker center not many stall.
It was a nice place filled with many facilities. There was a fish market then many food stalls. A 7 eleven and then guardian pharmacy.
Fry Hokkien Mee stall never wear mask while cooking my noodles. Prawn fresh but noodles no taste at all.
Friendbstore owners and nice beehoon in the mornings!
Smple parking space and lots of good food at hawker centre some have been there like more than 30 years. Amazing...
Full of customers queuing for their turns to get hold of delicious preparations.
Small but offers good tasting hawker fare. Porridge and Chee Cheong Fun were surprisingly good. Will be back for the wanton noodle which has a long queue
Smallish hawker centre and wet market serving a small community.
Best place for nasi campur
"A old estate since 70and 80 food centre provide favorite local dish, wanton noodles"
Mei You Dong Xi Hao Chi
Wak nakem has been around for all I can remember. My late grandmother used to stay around this area. This area brings back fond memories of going to the market and food stalls. There was a lot of game shops back then when I was still a young boy. And now I'm in my thirties.
Mee Pok is nice. Carrot cake is nice too. Great place to go after a run at East Coast   Park for breakfast.
Super Super Seddap Nasi lemak at the food court and deserves five star rating which is bang opp the posb atm is awesome . The chilli sauce (Sambal as they call it in Malay)  which comes with  the Nasi lemak is the tiara with Koh I our diamond on the food
Still good ol' authentic Singapore dishes!
Serve cheap and sufficient portion food.
"Xi Huan Ba Cha Li De Ji Rou Dang,Wa Kan Qi Lei Hen Xin Xian,Mai Liao Wu Ge Ji Yi. Huan You Shou Shi Dang De Zong Zi Ye Hao Chi. "
I love e handmade fishballs n yong tau fu fm Aunty Jennifer at stall btw 2 fish stalls . Fresh pork fm Joseph and kampung chicken fm a couple stall w big freezers on 1St row facing inside e market. Dry goods n all sorts of things for cooking fm a couple stall facing posb atm also very gd.
"it is a wet morning market, you can get fresh produces here. good variety of food stalls here for you to have your breakfast. i personally enjoy the tiong bahru wanton noodles here, the wanton comes in fried and soup version.
this is also the place where joseph schooling comes to have his carrot cake when he is in town."
"Mostly mediocre food while the wet market offers a great selection.
Friendly folks here make this a pleasant place to shop."
"One of the cleaner wet market. Spacious, compared with other"
"Must try the breakfast at this stall "" Ole Ole Bumbu"". Many varieties from local malay kuehs to all other ""sedap"" local dishes. No regrets."
Chang Fen Hao Chi!
Not many Stalls...
I have a soft drink everyday with shamir drinks stall. Nice conversation with the owner during that hours.
"Noodle and Longtong.
Charsiew fun really stingy when come to giving sauce to the rice "
Breakfast & Lunch only.
Is old place but still looking good alot food you can find
Normal market standard.
Great area
"Well, a typical wet market. But i like to get my spices here from the one and only Malay spice shop. The flavuor reminds me of Indonesia. Bumbu rawon..."
Lots of stalls offering a wide range of produce.
Plenty of choices. Has very cheap vegetable stalls. Good variety of food. Decent pricing.
A lot of choices for the local foods at reasonable price
"Pretty chill place with lots of good options for local fare. Fishball noodles at last row, wanton noodles and very good drink stalls with actually good beverages that I miss when I don't have it in a while."
Place is full of food choices. Food is delicious and reasonably priced.
Can get most groceries here. Some stalls vegetables reasonable cheap. The cooked food stalls has a lot of local selections. There's also Giant supermarket nearby too.
Great location.
Be prepared to share table at this hawker centre. A truly ageing sight around the market . Not to mentioned the maids as well.
Very close to my home
Good food n have Toto booth.but avoid buying cigarettes at the shop very expensive.
Like the wonton noodle. Have not tried too many yet. But plenty of choices
Malay stall open only drinks stall(Friday close) n Mee Soup stall
"Small hawker centre, doing breakfast and lunch business only."
Love the foods
Many food choices
East coast park
"A nice place for Singapore food, "
Standard hawker fare.
"Nice hawker centre at reasonable prices
Friendly stalls!"
"highly recommend the Chee Cheong Fun (plain) and the fishball noodle at the corner of the aisle facing the open space.

I'm told the tanjong rhu wonton mee and the longtong is great too! But I haven't had the chance to try it."
Small but friendly
A rather remote area in the eastern part of Singapore. There are some really decent stalls to patronise from. We had Meng Kee wanton noodle and the noodle was done in a grossy fashion that it is commonly found in Hong Kong. Many stalls in Singapore present their noodle that look dull and not appetizing. Will be certainly back  to check out for more options.
Good market especially the butcher stall abdul gafoor and sons. Great service and the price was good.
I like the freshly made Zhu Chang Fen
Too crowded
Lousy place..peanuts for peanuts
Good food!
"Good variety of food and groceries like chicken, fish , vegetables that can be bought here. Also a hawker centre connected and next to it."
"It's a nice and cheap place to buy all the household stuff and to eat different kinds of cuisine. There are lots of fruit shops here as well. There is an Indian Muslim food store for breakfast, lunch and dinner that is operating for the last 2 decades."
Zhe Yi Qu Shi Zi Zheng De Xuan Qu Zao Cheng Yang Yang Wu Pin Bao Gua Xiao Fan Bi Wu Luo Ya Long Shi Nai Gui Shi Shi Me Yuan Yin
"Good food stalls, but only drawback is that most shops close after lunchtime."
No.      In
Great old-time food. Good neighbourly vibes.
loves chee cheong fun there
Thank you fast info
"Must try the Cantonese chee choeng fun..
Make to order..great taste with more sauce... Lady very polite and nice."
Very fresh the vegetables
"Good market place, many foods stall..but many stall close after 2pm especially Malay stall."
"It's more of vegetables & less of fruits though it's called 50A Marine Terrace Markets Fruits.
However, whatever little fruits they are always fresh.
The Market also house a meat, poultry & fish market which is actually same size as the vegetable market."
"The Tanjong Rhu wanton noodles is superlative ! And further in, putu mayam is available and the Indian chappy will be happy to give you more coconut shavings n gula melaka .. If you still not satisfied, just walk to the kopi tiam next block for good bak chor mee. Next to the bcm is best roast to go w rice or noodles .."
Too crowded
nice nostalgic plc... friendly ppl
Best nasi rawon.. Generous serving.. Warong wak nakem...
"The wet market is good for buying veggies, fruits and meat. Ideal to go before 9-9.30. The veggies are quite fresh. Been there only couple of times"
"Lots of eateries, good food, wet market, fresh fruits...."
Home sweet home
"I like the meat, vegetables is fresh"
Normal market place
The place is quiet good for everyday fresh veges and meat.there are shops for fresh bread and bakes.
"One of the most expensive wet market, I ever know. Hawkers & stall owners are all very snobbish. Only operate until 12 noon. And Monday is definitely an off day, even if is a public holiday. Hawker food, so so. Only thing good about Marine Terrace, houses are very expensive. Other than that.....lousy. There are 2 wanton noodles stalls, equally poor in taste, but equally expensive. Used to have 3 coffee stalls, now left to 2. The 1 facing the road (husband and wife) are such noisy & boastful hawkers."
"I lived not far from this market. The different types of stalls selling different types of goods offer a wide range for choices. The food stalls too sell tasty delicious food like wanton noodle, carrot kueh & authentic muslim food."
Every sunday i go there buy fresh food
It's close to where I stay and it has good selections of food and groceries
Is a place since my childhood
"There is a great variety , neatly stacked, and within reach for old folks."
"This is near to my condo. A wet market with hawker centre selling the various food items and nearby shops near market like salons, minimarts, 24 hour giant supermarket and 24 hour 7 eleven. The marine terrace mrt in construction. It is the Thomson east line. The wet market is one place which opens early at 6 am prices are low and can bargain on prices"
$2.50 per plate with either Char Siew or Prawn!
Competitive priced
Cheap vegetable
"Seng Hoe fishball store has lousy customer service, allows people to cut queues, poor quality of food. Regret queuing for it. Do not be fooled by the queue"
Good service
One of the more expensive food center
"Most stalls were closed as I went late.. The fishball noodles was yummy and the lady boss served customers real fast, it's good especially when you are very hungry :)"
Store workers have very poor knowledge on merchandise they are selling.  Prices much above average in most of the stores. Flow of stores arrangements not user friendly.
"My first experience to the wet market.... You get a good variety from fresh fruits,  vegetables to meat/ fish.  I was also lucky to get planting/ gardening shops.... You also have food options for the tired shoppers!! :)"
It's actually a hawker centre. Great food and amazing drinks tho
Wet Market - Good quality vegetables mainly from Malaysia Fresh every day . Reasonable price.
"Bak chor mee is nice,tanjung rhu wan Tan mee also very tasty"
Ambience is good. Small outfit with good service.
"Although not many hawkers stall there, but a few authentic stalls there are popular among regulars such as the pork porridge, Tg.Rhu wanton noodle,Lontong and Malay rice, vegatarian food, fried carrot cake, bee hoon ,etc.Also 2 coffee shops near by have some nice food too. Just remember to park your car properly to avoid getting summon."
Market and hawker centre
Guy always seems so reluctant to make fruit juice....... Dude it makes money for you.
Delicious food and yummy
Cheap but don't expect quality unless you pick and choose yourself.
Best food in town
Nice and popular fish ball noodles at the corner! Sedap
"Ting Che Fang Bian!Chi De Huan Bu Cuo,Jiu Shi Tan Wei You Dian Shao,Xuan Ze Bu Duo"
Bakery was good.
Nice vegetarian food n nongya kueh n dumpling
busy place
"Whatever Sunday comes..I do get cravings for a nice ""mee pok ta"" and I will drive to Marine Parade Blk 50A. The noodles are generously a lot and so are the ingredients. I like their chillies a lot and best of all I always ask them for an extra  helpings of crispy pork lard bits which never fails to up the taste of my noodles a notch higher. I ordered a extra serving of slice fish soup but it's pretty ordinary, just okay."
"The wanton noodle taste really good, the dried version. Also there is handmade chee cheong fun stall and a popular fishball noodle stall."
Great breakfast area and plenty choices of food. Good noodle store.
Is a hawker center
the noodle stall service suck n very expensive
"Best food Kacang Phool, Roti John with own marinated sauce, Maggie grg, (Nasi Briyani Every Saturday & Sunday), Mee Rebus, Nasi Goreng."
Somewhat spare
An outstanding market were we can meet all our needs
This place sells ornamental pet fish/ terrapins and related equipments. Collection is basic but serves its purpose. Friendly shop owner.
It waa good.
Nice and delicious food there!!
Warung Wak Nakem food is really old skool n out of this world !!!!
Dirty. Cleaner is not automatic to clear the stuffs on the table.
Food is good
"Nothing interesting to crow about. Hawker foods are expendsive and bad serving, impolite to customers, esp to the elderly."
A lot of good food for breakfast
Gd improvement especially between food ctr n wet market
"Local vegetables available within the center of the market,  unbelievable!"
Convenient place for food and wet maket
Warong Wak Nakem! Sambal Sotong and Lontong. Best ever 
"mainly older people , lontong with sotong best ."
"Quiet, airy, nice food and good price"
Great variety of food choices for such a small estate.
Less store than typical hawker centre
"Place has retro old world charm, though the toilets are built too close (facing the stalls and most of the seats) for my comfort. Some good food to be found here, including excellent Hong Kong styled rice flour rolls (Chang Fen)"
Lots if food. People are friendly
Food is affordable and nice. Selection is good. I recommend trying the fish soup and fish porridge.
A market place where people buy groceries and food as well
"Carrot cake stall owner is rude. Two of us taking one plate and he wanted to charge for the disposal chopsticks. Moreover, many stalls don't open in the morning."
Horrible place to eat. Stalls always closed. Stall owners hostile n fear. Servicing small & taste not that fantastic. Won't be coming again. Really bad experience.
"One of my favourite local markets in Singapore! The soya bean milk drink stall at the far end of the centre facing the road always has a long queue, thanks to its freshly made soya bean milk.

The smell of bread wafts through the air in the morning from the neighbourhood bakeries - definitely worth a try.

One of my favourite stalls would be the Chee Cheong Fun stall in the middle aisle, where they serve Chee Cheong Fun (rice rolls) with BBQ pork/prawn/plains.

Across the other hawker stalls in the compound, you can't go too wrong just throwing a stone and choosing one. No better place to experience the authentic local experience."
"Too crowded not enough space :(
BUT food is super nice!"
Not too bad for a bite.
Very expensive food centre
Affordable good food. Most stalls closed on monday.
"The food is affordable and nice....
Ppl around there are good too...."
"Always busy.. nice local food, nice ambient if u looking for local dishes"
Just another hawker centre
It has many eateries selling all sorts of food and drinks
Only active in the morning till 12pm then most of the shops close
Bersih rapih dan tertib di sana
Strategis buat saya...dekat pasar n giant
You d reach d
Nice market to shop for fresh meat and veg..and good hawker stalls
Early morning 4.45 am stall open
"Ideal as breakfast & lunch haven as vast majority of food stalls do not operate after 2pm. Range includes Vegetarian, Chinese and Muslim Halal food choices. Some of the food stalls serve up delicious authentic local cuisines at reasonable hawker prices. Almost every type of fresh & dried produce can be found at the Wet Market which begins from 530am and lasts till Noon."
Yeah my favorite place
"Had mixed vegetables rice. 1 meat 1 veg 1 fried egg for $3.70. In my opinion, it is a little expensive. Very nice teh halia sold here @ $1.20."
A place to have hawker food fare. However most stalls are closed after 2pm.
Hawker center
Many food stalls food are commendable!
It's a local wet market. Quite popular with the nearby residents. There are lots of eateries too and it is within the market.
Pleasant n Friendly Atmosphere.
Big variety of fresh fish. Big carpark. Go early! Can be very crowded during weekends.
Poor seating capacity. Unfriendly aunties reserving tables for friends that are not there.
Place to visit to see daily life of Singaporean. They are very friendly and helpful. Have many shops and food court.
Good food to get there
Hawkers mostly shut in the afternoons.
"Very few stalls, malay food and fish noodles are good."
Awesome place for cheap food.
The coffee stall near the toilet is good
"Good fishball noodles, chicken rice. Look for long queue for clean food.
Market floors are damp. So walk with care.
Seafood/produce/meats are cheaper then Eunos Crescent Local market."
Always there for food n marketing. Quite clean n the stall owners are friendly n honest.
Lots of stuff
I tried the food at the coffee shop. I enjoyed the fish porridge at the hawker ctr.
Cyclists riding along this wet market area Very fast do not stop just dash on . Do not care about the pedestrians at all.
Traditional wet market
Right next to the sea on the East Coast Park access from Marine Terrace. Many shops and places to eat under the HBD buildings
Excellent selections near retirement homes
Recommend the fish soup highly!  The lontong is also very popular here.
"I love local food here ,taste is good and cheap"
Nice food and clean market
Good place for fresh produce.
The place is very clean .
Small neighborhood market serving the nearby community. Serves great food. The fishball noodle soup is a must-try.
The very few wet markets in singapore.good mix of food.. also make-shift stores selling chinese crafts..
Stalls only open till early afternoon. Not much stalls at night.
Cheap variety of halal and non-halal.
"Small neighbourhood market, hawker centre, with a small Goat supermarket."
Good place for breakfast n launch
Old market but a lot of good food
Limited parking space.
"Long overdue for a total facelift.  Roof is low, ventilation is poor, The food centre seat capacity is way behind the population growth in the area. But varieties of foods and ingredients remain very good."
Good place to catch morning kopi
"Wet market offers a good variety of fish, meat and vegetables at reasonable price. For breakfast, you can have a good teh sarabat, fish ball noodles, wanton noodles, pork porridge... Seating capacity is limited so you may have to wait for a seat."
Its a combination of shop fronts and public housing units (HDB).
Local hawker centre and limited food choices
My Everytime shopping center .cheap and comfortable .
Lunch and TCM session
Got TCM body treatment facility & 2 coffee shops within same block
Good food at cheap price.
Wet market has variety vegetables and meats. One of the best I have seen.
Cheap and nice food
Cheap eats
"Not a very big market, can get what you want.Can get delicious cooked food from market and nearby coffee shop."
2 malay good foods avail
The best place
"Food cheap and good  place not clean, food court should improve cleanliness"
"This food centre has quite a few good stalls like Wanton noodle, congee, carrot cake, nasi padang etc. However, the stalls close after 2 or 3pm, except the congee stall which closes at about 9.30-10am.(Yes, they are that good!) The exception is a fish ball soup stall which closes at night. The Mee pok and fish soup are quite good. However, be warned if their helper is a young PRC as she tends to mess up customers' order because she is easily confused with a bad memory. On several occasions, she would forget to pack your rice if you order fish soup with rice, so you are left with an incomplete meal at home. Sometimes, customers have to repeat several times as she keeps relating the wrong order to the boss who prepares the food, so you have to be around this female helper to make sure she's not messing up your orders.
Another down side, there are too many birds there and you find bird droppings on the tables and seats which is super disgusting and unhygienic."
So gd to have breakfast with the love one and marketing is so convenien
Wide selection of food and drink choices at reasonable prices. Gets crowded during lunchtime but food is good for their price. (had the fishball noodles and mixed vegetables rice) . Toilet available but 10 cents entrance fee. A few sheets of toilet paper at 20 cents and tissue packs at 30 cents each can be bought at the toilet entrance.
Great food all under 1 roof.
There are some nice foods over here but not many
Relatively clean market with wide selection of fresh food items. Hawker centre has nice appam and porridge.
"Local Vegetables  long time sellers, 3 Generations"
Small market for the locality's needs
Food is decent at a very reasonable price. Many types of Groceries easily available.
"One of the best hawker centers around! A hidden gem, has a wide choice of food options but most stalls are open only for breakfast and some for lunch with limited stalls open for dinner. The Malay food stalls serve some of the best nasi padang around. The vegetarian stall is one of the best around. Recommended. The Indian Muslim drink stall has a wide choice of drink options - teh halia has genuine ginger in it, not powder. Try the lemon ginger ice drink too."
People should visit and petronise the stall name Ole Ole... food are great
Nice place not overcrowded.
Carrot cake a bit over rated..
This is one of the dirtiest market availabl.. Smoking is also suported by the Authority here. There are 2 smoking tables inside and 2 more on the outside.. thats how much smoke innocent including young children have to inhale here... Guess tobacco tax is too good

Free WiFi.
Excellent place
Reasonable food pricing in the surrounding.
Good place to have quick food
"Ok.. ok lah.. you still can find a ""C"" graded stall an indication of not so good market compare to a good market with often times just ""B"" and ""A"" graded stall."

"Dan Rong Yu Yun Tun Mian Hao Chi ,Qi Ta Yi Ban,Xiao Ba Cha"
Great food n choices
nice place!
Many good food here. Most stalls open in the morning Tues- Sun
A Place for Breakfast Every Morning.
Nice food but opens only in the mornings. Market is quite dirty.
"grew up here. Food is good, vegetables are fresh. And there is a speciality stall that sells fresh herbs like mint, dill, basil, rosemary n lots of organic veg."
Fried carrot cake here lives up to the hype
The wet market area is very dirty :(
"Good selection and variety of food, shops and amenities for the locals staying in this area. A go to place with popular food joints and a good wet market. Coming soon an mrt (thomson line) just right in front."
Decent food choices! Great dishes especially the Kolo Mee.
It's good to be there
"Enjoyable, lots of vegetables, meats n cooked food to eat for breakfast."
"Small, crowded. Sharing table is the only way to get seated. Food choice is ok."
My favourite porridge - 21/1/17
Food there is cheap and good but closed on Monday.
"Try the vegetarian and the fishball noodles, they are next to each other"
"Place is small but food is pretty decent. Ba Chor Mee, porridge, old school wanton mee and Joseph Schooling carrot cake."
Having my breakfast here. Nothing much special.
"Sunday noon live music, seng hoe fish ball is a must!"
"Many foods, great taste."
Shun Cheng Kway & Carrot Cake #01-297
Love the mee hoon kueh! Always so chew yummy fresh and delicious 
"Excellent Bowl of ban Mian. Nice, springy noodles with the right amount of chilli and crispy ikan bilis.

Edit 18 Feb : Tried the seafood ban Mian for $5.5. Was really good. Comes with 2 huge prawns, fried fish and tasty broth. The noodles remain springy and the chilli adds wonders to the taste."
Good noodles - nicely seasoned and generous with the toppings.
Would be good if the fried fish was crispy not soggy. Ee mee was too soft. Apart from that it tasted ok.
One of the best stalls for Ban mian and mee hoon kway! Love the chilli and the flavours.
food is alright but tastes like seafood
Love the food here. Must have the prawn paste chicken
No food after 2 pm. Thus after 2 pm don't come.
"1st time trying this zichar stall located in an old coffeeshop. Ordered 1 mee goreng and 1 xinzhou beehoon, each cost $5 quite affordable. Portion very generous for $5 but not much ingredients. Overall taste average."
"The xing zhou mi fen is on the dryer side, 70% close to a JB san lou bee hoon,  One of the better tasting & value for money zi char in woodlands imo."
"i've eaten from this stall a few times. the main reason why i started was because this stall is the only stall selling such food in this area.

honestly, his food is actually not too bad. he serves rice bowls with meat on it, at an affordable price. i've tried his braised meat rice and beef rice, and it actually tastes refreshing, compared to the boring choices hawker centres typically have.

if you want to eat this, do take note that the serving sizes aren't usually that big, and his dishes consist of mainly rice. the dishes are more of an add-on.

update: i may have to eat my words. the bowl is HUGE"
Not bad eat!
"As a Cantonese from Hong Kong, I think this soup shop is the best in Singapore. The long Q (25+ ahead of me) was worth the wait - it moves quickly."
"Recently closed- I tot they open on Thursday to Sunday
Miss their soup already- went in Thursday and Friday both day also close. What happened ah?!?

This is a woodlands Gem and a must try food. Die die must eat.
Down side is the long snake queue.
By why so long ? Must have its own charm and reason."
"Saw a super long queue and decided to try it- went for the Buddha jump over the wall soup and olive rice ($9.50) and wasn't disappointed. Soup was rich and chicken was tender. Other ingredients were fresh as well. Not super salty- actually even on the blander side so I suppose it's great for a healthier option.

Will recommend if you're looking for something healthy!"
"Regular here for watercress pork ribs soup, goes well with olive rice. Expect to wait as usually will have long queue @ peak hours."
2nd time eating
Value for money
"Very very healthy and yummy soup, my mum is very picky about the taste of soup and she also praised this stall for the favour. No MSG will not feel very thirsty after drinking, I have recommended to many people, best soup in Woodlands!"
i love their lotus soup
Savoury soup and free top up! Packed with herbal goodies. Definitely will go again.
Best Hua Sheng Lian Ou Pai Gu Tang
"Queue is very quick, the Fo Tiao Qiang is quite nice too. Would recommended 10/10"
First time eating here. Excellent. Fast service even though only the couple.
"Very thick soup and full of umami.
Must try their Budha jump over the wall with pumpkin rice."
One of my favourite herbal soup stall! try out the Ten tonic herbal soup and lotus soup!

"The citizens of woodlands would know that this double boiled soup is one of the best in the hood.

Have been coming here since I was schooling and the food here is so flavourful and has so much depth.

Flavoured rice has always been generous in ingredients. Love the pumpkin rice with dried shrimp and pumpkin bits, and the olive rice which is so generous with the fragrant fermented olive leaves.

My go to soup has always been the Lotus Root with Peanut & Pork Rib soup. The soup is leaning towards the heavy side. The pork Ribs are so tender, and the tendons are jelly-like as well. Full of collagen, the soup also is slightly sticky from melted pork fat  I swear. If you like the Cantonese style of double boiled soup, this is really the holy grail of double boiled soup in Woodlands."
"Probably the best soup stall in the north, which comes with 3 choices of rice: pumpkin, olive and white rice. Always long queue during lunch and dinner time. Reasonably priced, my favorite is the watercress pork ribs soup and white chicken soup. It's located at the marsiling mall ground floor unit #01-03 next to the main entrance. So you can find it easily."
Best tonic soup stall in SG
"Nice~
Must try: Olive rice"
"Ordered Buddha Jump Over the Wall for $8 and Olive rice for $1. Queue time was 25min

Was contemplating between rice or olive rice and choose olive rice for twice the cost. It probably taste more than twice as good as normal rice. The rice was fragrant each grain individualized. They are on the harder side which is great since you probably wanna pour some soup on it.

Soup was fantastic. It is naturally sweet and flavorful with no thirsty urge after drinking. Best part is the fish maw and rightly so since it soaked up all juicy goodness of the soup. Chicken basically crumbled on chopstick swipe but is understably tasteless. You can either down it with soup or dip into the soya chili which packed a wicked kicked. The chili is spicer than average since they were left to soak.

There were also mussels and probably bamboo shoot (don't think is sliced abolone). I think my only issue or two is the mussels feels like sweet potato texture while it is probably not very filling given that it is mostly soup."
"Pork rib with watercress was clear tasting. A touch of sweetness.

Lotus root with pork rib was rich with a lingering sweetness (again). Probably added rock sugar to its stock. An aftertaste of orange peel.

Here, they used pork ribs with soft cartilage.

Pumpkin rice is drier style compared to those offering similar product. Bits of dried shrimp and cabbage in the mix.

During lunch hour, a long queue but it moved quickly."
This soup is perfect! Their Buddha jump over the wall ($7.50) and ten perfect soup with black chicken ($6.50) and pumpkin rice ($1) are killers. Try not to order takeaways cos they are smaller. Always get the soup and drink direct there!
Definitely the best Lao huo tang in the area. No other Lao huo tang in Woodlands comes close. Price is reasonable too.
Excellent Tasty Soup
"Operated by an old couple. It's usually very long queue, I guess mainly it's the comfort food for most people. Also their soup is the thicker broth type rather than clear soup. It's flavorful and the soup ingredient taste good as well. They have a choose of pumpkin rice, olive rice and white rice. It's also quite common for takeaway.
They close early on Sunday at 2pm or after sold out. So not open Sunday for dinner time.
You are welcome to BYOB (maybe they can give more soup)"
"Ordered the black chicken soup and XiYang Chai tang..

Chili perfect , soup perfect, portion perfect, service very fast... everyday drink, everyday healthy... really good soup.. yum yum"
"Soup has no Msg. Feel the Awesomeness in natural taste and flavour. No thirst after drinking.
Queue starts forming at 4 pm on weekdays. Started queuing at 11.30 am on a Sunday.

Crowd Favourites: Lotus Root Soup
Personal choice: Watercress Soup"
"Saw a queue forming just before 4pm, before the stall opens. Well prepared soup and you won't feel thirsty after drinking - as sign of no MSG. They have option for white, pumpkin and olive rice. The olive rice taste just nice with the soup."
Tried the lotus root and peanut soup takeaway. One of the best I tried.
"Not a soup expert but it's probably the best tasting lotus root pork rib soup I've had. Soup was really tasty and the ribs were really soft.

Located in the hawker centre at Marsiling mall, it's the stall 2nd from the front, facing the main road. Probably a 8 min walk from Woodlands MRT, you should definitely try it if you're in the area!"
Very stingy with ingredients and portion. Don't patronise. Better food around the same compound
"Came early to avoid the queue, traditional lor mee is $4.50 price updated"
"Brought my own container for takeaway and was told because I did not pay takeaway fees, they won't give takeaway chopsticks and spoon  Cheapskate!"
"Aunty made my order wrongly - Ordered pork rib noodles, came home to find out they gave me prawn noodles instead. Not only were there 1.5 small prawns, there were also only 2 thin slices of pork. For $4.50 I would rather go somewhere else..."
"The prawn noodles were decent, but to be honest big or small the portion is the same measly bit. For $6 you can get so much more from other shops selling the same thing, 4 halved prawns for this price? Be a smart consumer and look else where."
"Ordered the signature lor mee for 6 bucks
But the liao so little hias . Store loom atas but liao cmi
Prawn was so thin machiam slice into three part with one prawn. The shao rou like non existent. Only the pork cracklings is a lot more . I think my shao rou on me got more than the lor mee. Gravy ok la not so nong."
No coriander for the lor mee. Unacceptable.
Ordered lor mee. Not bad
20/02/25 portion and ingredients for $4.5 really not worth it   1.5 prawn 
"Today is laksa day, tried and felt disappointed due to the gravy. The presentation looked decent, with the portion as well."
Mei You Wei Dao Mei You Xia Wei De Xia Mian 
"I have been eating this store since Kampung Admiralty opened, used to be really good but lately the standard is dropping it's sad "
Delicious prawn noodles.
"The food portion is ridiculous. $4.50 lor mee you would expect at least something to keep you at least 3/4 full. But no, the portion is akin to kids portion. The noodles is so little that I finish the whole bowl in less than 3 mins. They are really stingy on the noodles and ingredients. Avoid!"
"Service staff very unfriendly and always forgot/ mistaken the orders!!!
The staff cooking always show black face..see also no appetite"
Standards drop way below average. Portion and gravy only half the bowl. Disappointed.
"I hardly ever eat Lor Mee (except Taman Jurong hawker centre, Clementi Central hawker centre, Tiong Bahru hawker centre, and Hong Lim hawker centre), but this is good. I ask for less spicy on their Signature Lor Mee. The little meaty and fried bits are yummy."
The good is good and worth queuing the service is great with the younger man and an elder lady combination the tastiest Lor mee I had ever tasted
Delicious Laksa
"i don't understand the bad reviews, i actually like the lor mee very much"
don't usually eat lor mee but this one really not bad. i wouldn't mind eating again.
Take away prawn noodles say they don't pack soup with it then what the difference when u eat there they serve with soup and the soup cannot pack when take away suggestions not a good stall and the prawn only ok not so good
"Owners are rude and their food portion is getting lesser and lesser and we speak. Pls boycott this store if u can as there are much more better food in that hawker. As of today date 25th June, 1 strand of hair found inside the laksa"
Super stingy owners and staffs! Very small portions yet they still kept increasing the prices! Tried their lor mee and prawn noodles before and was super regretted. Basically only 1 prawn cut into half. What a joke!
"The portion sizes were disappointingly small for the price, and the lackluster attitude of the staff left much to be desired. After consuming the food, I found myself feeling unusually thirsty (too much MSG and salt??), which is concerning. Overall, a stingy hawker experience that I won't be repeating."
Can use CDC vouchers as payments
"Cheap options but small portion and tastes below average. If you are poor like me, you will appreciate this store. Try their prawn noodle and Lor Mee before, broth normal but their noodles are so hard."
"The $2.80 lor mee is cheap but portion is for kids. No worries; just buy 2. I like the taste and texture. Update: now they take out Ngor Hiang for $2.80.
Update: price is now risen to $4.50 but I would only order if the older woman is NOT preparing the food. She is extremely stingy."
"This stall is a scam . I bought lor mee at $4.5 but they never give me Wu Xiang,Lu Rou and chicken chop . Xiasuay , hope ur business close down continue to cheat ur customers"
"I have tried the traditional lor mee 4.5$.
The lor mee is nice with various Liao.
However, it will be better if the portion is bigger :D"
Prawn mee that cannot get extra soup.  Bad attitude. Come at your own risk.
Food stall in Admiralty.  Extremely expensive for a bowl of prawn noodles with little prawn and meat at $4.50 .  Go eat something better around. Not worth your money.
Food is OK. But suuuuuuper small bowl for $4.50. shrinkflation max.
"Below average lor mee (btw picture I separated the ingredients myself and mixed the bowl already) - Traditional Lor Mee @ $4.50. They were super stingy with the gravy, it barely covered my noodles which was also small in portion. So I can't give proper rating on the gravy either, wasn't enough to enjoy. It's my first time at a lor mee store where condiments are kept inside... Don't recommend."
Yes $2.80 price tag u can't find elsewhere but is bull. The qty of food not even enough to feed an old man. Marsiling market prawn mee $3.00 gie double portion of qty n feed a hungry man full. $4 portion feed a husband n wife sharing. Don't get misleads by the price tag.
"ordered laksa n lor mee (small).
taste good. portion of laksa is small despite is regular size ( no choice of small/big bowl)."
"1/2 Lu Dan, 1 Xiao Wu Xiang, few Shuang Kou Cui Cui Rou & Cu Mi, $2.80, you really cannot find elsewhere with current inflation market place. Taste wise is decently good with its value with its few mouthful's bowl with this price, dun expect anything fancy. They are just a humble stall operating since opening of Kampung Admiralty. I see them grow all this years as at the north area not much stall selling this. Although $4 is the normal portion which includes everything but for me this is value for money when you just wanted a small portion to ease the carve of lor jiap (Lu Zhi). And also it's something that they offered to help the local less fortunate community. That's what I like from Kampunv Admiralty Hawker.
~~updated July 2023~~
Sincerely appreciate they still maintained the lowest price of $2.80. Can give them support regularly.
~~updated Sept 2023~~
Finally they increased their standard pricing of their menu. Although the $2.80 bowl still available but no more Xiao Wu Xiang, a little disappointed."
Used to be good when it first open initially. The portion is miserably getting lesser and lesser years after years. Only filled 1/3 of tapau ware for $4 upsized portion. Can't imagine the $2.80 portion.
Love the lor mee here. Portion tends to be slightly on the smaller side.
"there's multiple layers of flavour to the lor mee here, which is very very different from the usual lor mee you find outside which are very starchy but no flavour.

even the fish is different also. overall this is just really really good stuff. if you're a lor mee lover then this will be definitely be top 3 in your list, no questions asked."
"The budget lor mee is very small serving, for big eaters you need 2-3 bowls. For me, i need 2 bowls.
The quality of the lor mee is not there, lack of taste & fragrance of the normal lor mee. The gravy a bit salty at times, depending on the person preparing your order 
Definitely a far cry from the Tiong Bahru Lor Mee or any other good Lor Mee stalls that I have tried.
The standard of the food can be further improved."
"Ji Shi $4Fen Liang Ye Hen Shao,Huan Ji Cuo Liao Ba Lu Mian Kai Shi Gei Cheng Laksa. Suan Wei Hen Chong,Ke Yi Liu Yi Zheng Tian Wo Hen Hao Qi $2.8He $4De Fen Liang Dao Di Chai Duo Shao. "
"2nd time with very bad exprience.

I paid 4 dollar for my lor mee, while the guy infront me pay 2.50.
His have prawn mine dont even. Plus look more like the 2.50 instead.
Believe that aunty accidentally swap our bowls, i ask the aunty if 4 dollar ones look like this. She took a half glance and said yes and ignore me. While i look at the picture that the 4 dollars one does include a prawn.

Very bad customer service, believe earn too much till dont even care at all. Will nvr ever patronize her shop ever again.

Not even worth a star, this is a 2nd time that i given this shop a chance."
Portion super super small. Normal price for less than half a normal portion. Regretting not reading the reviews before trying.
A balanced portion of lor mee yummy
Food above average but not the best. The worst is the attitude is very bad. 2 stars for the parwn noodle
A reasonable tasting bowl of Lor Mee though portions are rather miniature.
"Like what many other patrons have already mentioned, the portion is pathetic, and they don't allow patrons to add condiments to their food themselves, meaning chilli, vinegar, etc ""essential"" condiments for a decent bowl of lor mee were all kept within their stall. I have attached a photo to show you the portion I got for my takeaway, see for yourself."
"Overly priced. For the portion, my 5yo son can eat 2 bowls. You can get better lor mee elsewhere"
"This bowl of prawn Noodles cost $4.
Given 2 small slices of small Pork
Given 2 small slices of fish cake.
Given 2 pieces of prawns which are cut in half. So basically you're only getting 1 entire prawn.

Get your prawn mee fix somewhere else. The portion is so not worth $4."
"NOT Recommended. Food is from bad to worst. 2 spoonfuls of noodles is what you get when you order their 'Signature' Lor mee. Gravy is blend, pathetic portion or ingredients (PHOTOS FOR ILLUSTRATION ONLY). Oh ya, bad attitude."
"If you're craving for lor mee, this place doesn't disappoint. The gravy is flavourful and don't get me started on the fried balls that comes with it. Absolutely divine, 100% would pay extra for more crispy goodness."
Prawn noodle soup taste weird and sweet. Overpriced and served in small portion like for the kids lol. Pathetic
"Poor service. And the portion of mee getting small and the price is expensive. I have requsted to add mee, and did mentioned to that auntie, you may judge from the photo, the mee is extra add or not? Will not visit this store again. Totally ban it."
"$4 lor mee on the smaller portion side.
Service was fast.
Fried stuff was good, gravy was little but taste was not bad.
Not a bad place for lor mee in neighborhood location."
"Overrated noodle place, Do Not be misled by the Q.

Food is average and dissapointing. Lousy service attitude. Give this stall a miss.

Cutlery for takeaways customer to pay 20Cents!? Mgmt be ashame of such requirment when customer bring their own containers. Why not charge customer for plastic bags too?"
What a pathetic bowl of prawn noodle. With only 2pc of small prawn and 3pc of fish cake and it cost you $4 for this bowl. Last time it came with few pcs slice pork and it cost only $2.80 now they cut away ingredient no pork and yet increase price. Although the noodle standard is still there but the portion serve is no longer worth pricing.
"Yue Lai Yue Bu Hao Chi Liao. Cu La Jiao Fang Tai Duo Hen Suan
Wei Dao Pao Liao"
Super rude uncle. and service for ingredients is small.
The taste is getting worst & portion getting smaller for $4. I've tried much better Lor Mee elsewhere. This stall is not recommended at all! Don't waste yr time here. The Ah Ma Mee Sua next door is so much better!
"Service was mediocre, and the takeaway's gravy portion was pathetic for the $5 option. Taste is so-so at best, some of their fried items are nice, but there are many, many lor mee stalls out there which can beat this.
Overall, I would say it isn't worth eating and there are other stalls there which are really much better, like the economic beehoon, Ah Ma Mee Sua, etc."
Portion too small. Not value for money
"Poor customer service, the auntie is super duper rude

In the first place, they purposely hide all the chilli, garlic and vinegar inside. Then they can't withstand me from asking if there's any chilli, garlic, or vinegar inside, and spoke rudely by saying put in already

Choices of reference not given for noodles too. So what's the point they gave many noodles option.

Food is normal as other lor mee stall, gravy is nice but less portion. They gave less portion to serve more.

Overall, not recommended, who wants to spend money to buy food and let the auntie ruin your day with her rude mouth"
"Tried the $2.80 Lor Mee, the taste is ok but felt that it could have been better if there's more vinegar :) If you're looking to eat your fill, consider getting the larger portion instead of this. $2.80 is enough as light meal "
The Lor Mee was very traditional and fulfilling... The gravy is thick and delicious... nice food 
 very good service and yummy food! Cute store owner too
$4 for 4 mouths of lormee. E smallest potion I ever ate B4. Only 1/4 of e bowl are filled. Not even nice.
Very average
Serving is getting more and more miserably lesser. Price remains the same but the portion is so small.
"Yes.....one of the best tasting lor mee i ever have....
Tasty broth , tasty ingredients....generous portion of ingredients and the lor mee...
I also rate 5 /5 Stars Service as the staff there is friendly and with a good attitude to serve customers....
I will definitely go there again to eat lor mee again...
"
Happened to me too. There was no prawns though I ordered $4 a week ago. Now I travel further for better lor mee
"I have been to several places to try out lor mee. I grew up eating lor mee for breakfast. I was recommended to try Ah Choon Traditional Lor Mee. And so I decided to give it a try. Boy, I was in for a treat. The broth was just about the right texture and flavour. The noodles, pork and prawns cooked really well. It was as if I was eating what I usually had in my childhood days. I love this place and this lor mee. Kudos to this stall for making this awesome lor mee. I definitely would recommend this place. Come, and give it a try.  This is now my go-to lor mee!!"
"I liked this stall lor mee taste and always buy from them whenever I have my lunch there.  Today went there again, but to my disappointment, I noticed that their standard have dropped.  The taste is not as good, the ingredients also lesser and the worst part is even you pay additional $0.50 for the noodle you also can't tell any difference.  Although I have ordered value meal, but doesn't mean value meal mean lesser portion right?  if is, might's well name it as kid's meal.  This should be my last visit to this stall."
"This is the first time I patronise this stall. I chose the $4 Signature Lor Mee as the $2.80 lor mee could be a small serving and has no prawn.

When I reached home, there was no prawn found and the amount can only feed a child.

I gave one star for the variety of ingredients There were a fried fish, fried chicken, gor hiang, half a soy egg, 2-3 crispy fritters & a thin sliced of pork belly)

Another star for the friendly foreign helper who suggested to separate the noodle and gravy for take away."
"Used to be one of the more popular stalls when the hawker centre was first opened. Over time, standard dropped and portioning got smaller. Pathetic portion for their $4 signature loh mee."
Horrible food and owner.
"Great food, bit ingredients are not alot"
"This is one of the saddest Lor Mee I've ever eaten. If you choose not to let customers take their own condiments, then you jolly well have to endure the various requests and not put on an annoyed face. Gravy portion given was pitifully and didn't even tasted that good, and I could hardly taste the gravy since there were barely any coating the noodles. And I accidentally swallowed the pathetic little bits of braise pork belly without noticing so I couldn't comment on that. Very sad meal."
"Very rude and bad attitude. Asked if can add a little more soup, they say they don't give extra soup.
Ordered noodles without chilli but added in chilli and said i confused her.
Worst attitude in the hawker center.
Won't go again.."
"Attitude bad service. Request for more gravey shouted at me and mentioned alot already. When I return home the gravey all no more.

If separated the gravey also need to pay extra. Wont go again. Eat at your own risk"
The lor mee cost $4 but the portion reminds me of my primary school canteen 30 cents noodles meant for kids. It just occupies like half of the bowl only. Stop wasting your time eating them because you will order something else to eat again.
I don't really eat Lor Mee and this is the stall had my opening ceremony of my Lor Mee Journey!
The broth is quite tasty but honestly they could be more generous with the noodle. The normal $2.80 lor mee is literally 3 mouth and you're probably left with gravy. Despite adding noodle it still can't satisfy a small eater. 
Highly recommended for lor mee lover
"Order a takeaway laksa reach home totally dry up in 10mins time, laksa becomes dry laksa, shud give more laksa gravy, very disappointing"
some vendors are liddat.. bought lor beehoon.. asked for more sauce cos beehoon will absorb de sauce.. she said she already gave the max she could give.. reached home in 15 mins.. totally no sauce at all.. beehoon and ingredient including the sauce not even 3/4 of the tubberware.. do business so niao for wad..not asking for unreasonable amount of sauce.. just asking for wad should be given.. ended up eat dry beehoon.. whereby de beehoon still white in colour at the btm.. zero sauce to mix
Not recommended. Worst lor mee i have ever eat in my life. Tasteless. And this is how the Lor Mee look like. And this is after add noodle. So if you never add noodle maybe they only give you one mouth of noodle. Ridiculous.
"So gross! Dead Cockroach found ! Just bought 3 packets of laksa today for family. Very disappointing to see this in one of the soup base packet . So unhygienic! 
have been buying from this stall for their well-known lor mee, laksa and prawn noodle.. But today incident make me have doubts of going back again "
"Prawn noodles and lok mee for only $2.80 and it's really delicious, especially lok mee. However the portions are quite small, half of the bowl is filled, even small eater like me feeling like half full after the meal. The foreign lady helper is friendly but the local aunty cooking the noodles are quite rude, the helper told her my order of less noodles and more beansprout, she just ignored it."
Taste good.
"One of the nicer Lor Mee. Tasty! Although it serves with the fu xiang, crispy stuff, egg, and of course the sauce, it is not salty to my liking. Price is economic. My frequent stall here. Usually long queue during meal hours. If you like those crispy stuff, you can even add them accordingly! Most of the time, I will add the fried chicken (:"
Must try! Recommended to try! This cost $4 only for Chao Ji Lu Mian Traditional Lor Mee. Enjoy!
The best kway chap! We really enjoyed found this on TikTok. Will come again.
Very nice pig organ soup......
"Ah Keat Pig's Organ Soup and Kway Chap is a true gem for fans of traditional Singaporean fare. The broth is rich, well-balanced, and full of depth -- perfect on a rainy day or when you're craving something hearty and nostalgic. The organ meats are fresh, clean-tasting, and perfectly cooked, while the kway chap is silky smooth and so satisfying.

Service is fast and friendly, and the portions are generous for the price. You can tell this place puts real care into preserving authentic flavors.

If you're a fan of classic hawker-style comfort food, this spot is a must-try. Highly recommended for locals and visitors alike!"
"One of the best Kway chap I have tasted. The Kway chap soup is excellently tasty and the other stuff, small and big pig intestines, pig skin, tau kwa, sweet salted veggies and hard boiled eggs are also very tasty.

This stall has been my favorite for the past 6 months and I always come for my comfort food (brunch) after my run along and around the Woodlands Waterfront.

Highly recommended.

This stall is located at Blk 211 Marsiling Crescent Lucky Star Coffee Shop."
Loved this silky kway chap! Innards had no smell. Good value too with the generous ingredients. Coffeeshop has good ventilation.
Authentic Kway Chap. Just eat it is good.
Kway chap was nice. Portion was generous. Will be back for more.
"always order the kuay chap, without skin and vege, add big intestine. cleaned nicely without the stink.
kuay texture is thin and soft which i like
been eating here for years."
"Best comfort food. Been eating here for the past 20 over years. Same taste same flavour same style. Mildly herbal soup, well cleaned intestines, nicely braised ingredients."
"Great taste , come on and explore this"
"Bought kway chap, didn't give the ingredient at all. Only gave kway"
"The food is good but...

The service can be improved. For some reason the staff like to modify your order even when you clearly speak to the person who is supposed to receive the order...

Inflation is real i guess. The servings are getting smaller."
My all time comfort food since I was young.
Non fuss comfort local food.
"Giving a 2-star rating here.

1) Chilli sauce doesn't match Kway Chap well; better suited for chicken or duck rice. (Unimpressed) Golden Leaf Kway Chap's chilli sauce, however, is a fitting and delicious accompaniment to the Kway Chap meats. Trust me!

2) The soup - alright, with a somewhat herbal taste. Personally, I find Golden Leaf Kway Chap's soup and meat more to my liking.

3) The noodles are decent but lack sufficient moisture. Golden Leaf Kway Chap excels in this area, I assure you! Ah Keat Kway Chap tends to cater to those with simpler palates who aren't seeking top-notch flavors.

For those who appreciate top-tier Kway Chap soup and meats, I recommend trying Golden Leaf Kway Chap for a better experience. Google gives Golden Leaf Kway Chap 3.9 stars, which I find hard to believe, as tastes and opinions vary. Why not give Golden Leaf Kway Chap a shot? I did and it won my heart.

Unfortunately, Golden Leaf Kway Chap closes randomly on any given day, which is a drawback that could potentially ruin your visit. Be prepared with a backup plan in case you find the stall closed. It is at 11 Woodlands Close, Coffeeshop. (Closer to Spectral Secondary school)"
Simple no frills shop to go for kway chap! Fast service with decent portions and nice taste
Best Kway Chap especially with the Chilly 
"Good quality Kway Chap, definitely worth a visit if you're in the area. Only downside is that it's very out of the way. This place is slated to be demolished as part of the checkpoint expansion so hopefully they move somewhere more accessible"
Fresh food and value for money. So much cheaper compared to those in Bishan.
Very good kway chup and reasonably priced too. Wished it wasn't located so far away & more centrally located. Big intestines super yummy.
Very tasty pig organ soup in the North
Good plate of kway chap. Nicely braised.
"Kway Chap was awesome. Generous portions, reasonable price. Taste is 5/5. The staff were very polite and professional. Food have been consistently enjoyable everytime."
"I recently tried the kway chap and pork organ soup and was thoroughly impressed. The kway chap was perfectly cooked and had a great texture, complemented by the flavorful broth that was rich and comforting. The pork organs were tender and well-prepared, adding a delicious depth to the dish.

What stood out to me was the freshness and quality of the ingredients. The soup had a balanced seasoning, not too salty but packed with umami flavors. The portion size was generous, making it a satisfying meal.

I'll definitely be returning for more!"
Reasonable portion for one person
This is my family favourite store.
"Situated at an old coffee shop in Marsiling. Kway Chap, Pig's trotters, mian Xian  all good and nice"
"Always a go to place for nice kway chap. Chanced upon this place some time ago and love their braised pork, salted vegetable that go along with their kway chap! Give it a try if you are in the hood. The braised pork belly literally melts in your mouth! A bit like Dong Po Rou but less fatty of course! My friend says it is so good that she cannot bear to not eat the fats in belly pork!"
Above average. Like it's trotter and Zhu Za Tang better
"Serve the best braised pork leg in sg!! Very generous on the portion given
Provide very friendly service with smile everytime I go"
Nice Kway Chap and not really expensive.
Miss this so much!
One of the best Kway Chaps you will ever eat.
"Kueh chap good, but coffee anty keep looking at 4D call toorder coffee also don't know"
"Awesome tasting kway chap and pork organs. Price is typical of what you'll find in many other kway chap stalls across the island.

Intestines are soft. Love the tofu and the tau pok. Gravy has good flavour.

Just come down here and visit this stall for yourself, won't regret it!"
This place serves great Kway Chap in the north area. The gravy is flavourful and not too salty. The pig organs were fresh and wash properly. No awful smell.
Delicious 
Best pig organ soup and kway chup in Woodlands! Pig organ soup has many ingredients unlike some stalls I tried. Their pig trotter is also highly recommended! Combined with the kway chup. Perfect meal for the day.
Very good Kway Chap. The only similar thing with others is the self service regardless of your seating.
Kuey is smooth. The ingridents can be more fresher..
"$16.50 for 3 pax worth
Tasty
No queue on a saturday afternoon"
one of the best Kuey Chap in town
My favourite Kway chap stall! Cheap price and great taste! Opens 24 hour!
"Love the kway chap here, especially the Da Chang and Zhu Jiao. Meat is so soft. The serving is also generous. The auntie and men manning the stall are always helpful and nice."
"Frequently patronise this shop for their excellent Kway Chap and Pig's organ soup. Their kway is hot, thin and tasty. The intestines and organs are soft and flavourful, same for their meats and soy-based products. Chili is good enough. Would recommend getting both the soup and kway chap for a party of 3."
Nice place to have pigs organ.
Amazing Kway Chap! Intestines were well cleaned and flavorful from the braise (even the small intestines). Pig organ soup was flavourful yet did not have the over powering organ flavour that some places have
"Visited in early morning, so the meat was not as tender.  Flavor was good."
"A perennial favorite amongst its residents and nearby office workers.
This coffeeshop has a few great stalls like roast meats and teochew noodles.

The broad sheet kway is of average quality. It comes with pig's stomach, intestine and skin. All well cleaned and the skin was excellent with a bite. Well-cleaned and the braising liquid is flavorsome.
Beancurd Puff and braised Egg are well flavored. Fishcake and Tofu are 2 standouts.
Lastly, the preserved vegetable added a nice touch.
$5 per portion which is reasonable for the selection and quality.

A perpetual queue but moves quickly."
"Very clean and tender intestines! Great kwap chap! If u in the area, recommended to come"
"Been here sooooo many times! Standard never drops and its always as delicious! Kway is good and broth is yummy. The intestines are clean and perfectly braised. Definitely worth the time travelling here just to enjoy legit kway chup. Do do also order the meats from the stall next to it, its superbbbbb!!

Update: Try not to go during dinner period, soup tasted bland. They also accept non-cash payments, theres SG QR available."
"Above average kuay chap. The braised sauce is savoury and strong in soy sauce, spices. Innards have faint porky smell, which is to my liking. Broth is herbal and gao. But the egg taste weird."
Prettu decent kway chap. Egg has a werid taste.
"Excellent for its price. Flavor profile here is on the lighter side and I wish the Kway's soup has a stronger herbal taste but for $3.50 I got a generous portion of organs which were cleaned well! Kway was 50+30c as I got the larger one.

Again, portions are large and its the first kway chap I've had that was so filling.

Mar 2022 Update:
Pig organ soup is good too! There's alot more meat to organs, perhaps I need to pay for an upsize."
"This is Ah Keat too, only at Triple 8 plaza at woodlands! Delicious food, reasonable pricing and super smooth kway. Much better than those overly franchised braised duck stalks who try to do kway chup as well. These guys know what they're doing and they do it well. A solid five out of five!"
Economical and tasty. One of my favorite coffeeshop makan.
still good
"One of the best Kway Chap I ever tasted at Woodlands, everything is very flavourful and the price is affordable too. The intestines are given generously compared to other Kway Chap stores I been to, which is what I love about this store. Price is okay, $4.50 per pax including the Kway. I have been coming here to eat once at least every month, so good!
(as of 31 Oct 2021)"
One of the best Kway Chap. The chilli is good.
One of the best Kway Chup.
"Tan Wei Bu Duo,Dan Shi Bi Jiao Qing Jing,Yi Ban Du You Zuo Wei. "
Love their Kway chap. Intestines and stuffs are well cooked which is soft and yummy. Very value for money. Will keep going back for more. Thanks aunty for such comfort food
"Your standard kway chap with pig skin, intestines, fish cake, egg and tau pok. Kway was soft and soup was piping hot. The chap were flavourful. Price increased from $4 to $4.50 starting today (1 May)."
"Another option besides 888 and North Plaza to go for Kway Chap if you are in this area. They have everything here. Large intestine, small intestine and also pork skin. That is what make Kway Chap so delicious. Love that there is always place to sit to enjoy your meal."
"This Kuay Chap store is without a doubt one of the best Kuay Chap store in Singapore! So delicious, so cheap, good portion as well! Definitely give them a try if you can!"
"So far one of the good shops selling these in Woodlands area. Average price, only limited seating area until 888 complete it renovation. Ample car park at MSCP. Have other good shops around."
"Tried their Kway Chap. The intestines were juicy, really loved it. The other organs were tasty as well. Would definitely come back for more."
Nice random find!
Came over to eat due to the high review. Ordered the kway chap. It is actually very good with the chilli. The items are braised just nice. Remember to upsize as recommend by others. There is always people queuing.
Hidden gem.
Yummy kuay chap
Delicious food.
Very thick soup base! A cannot miss local delights!
Best kway chap I have eaten so far.definitely will come again.
Quite a lot of food stalls tastes Good.
One of the best kway chap I ever ate! Love the pig skin and big intestine.
Very traditional taste of kway chap
"The portion isn't very huge so if you're a huge eater, go ahead and order more ""kway"". The intestines are definitely enough for a larger portion of the carbohydrates.

Taste wise I think it's just nice, and the intestines are just fatty enough. There's nothing I can complain except sometimes I do get some hair on the pig skin but that's totally fine.

Even during peak lunch hours, they serve very fast! Revisit? Yes!

P.S. The serving is just nice for breakfast!"
"Highly recommend this store, cheap and delicious"
Nice & not expensive
Nice to have a meal there
Its gopd. The soup is tasty. Pretty rich in favor too
The kway was thin and the soup was hot. Good value for money.
Always good as usual.
The best Kway Chap in Woodlands. I travel from other town to eat at this place.
Good & tasty pig organ food price value for money
Not bad of a organ soup in the neighbourhood area!
"I tried the bat ku teh - although it wasn't your usual bak ku teh broth as the soup was that of the pig organ's soup, the soup had a tinge of sweetness to it and was really flavorful!"
The chili guess very well with the well-stewed organs. The kway chup is the dilute water type. Not starchy. Nice mild flavor
Food is nice for those pork & inner parts lover.
"Went in the later afternoon. No queue. Rice noodle sheets were made to order. Piping hot pig innards, braised well and soaking wet Tau pok. Not forgetting the braised pork belly. Cooked till soft and almost melt in your mouth. Very flavorful. Chilli gives a good kick. Enhances the taste of the dish. Worth a try! Not expensive also! All these for only 6 bucks!"
"Kway chap was nice, no gamey pork smell and it's flavorful."
Nice but nothing above those in most of the hawker centre.
Pig meat hard
"We ordered the pork rib soup, both clear soup and soy sauce versions. The meat was tender, juicy and delicious. The prices were very reasonable and well worth it."
Closed till 15th June 
My favorite!  
Doesn't look very hygienic to me.
Best food ever
"Ofals were tender, melt in your mouth and seasoned just right."
Nice and cheap food
Nice and cheap.  Value for $$
Good price but they had raised their price recently
Pig organs soup and and kewchap as good as before good value for money
Worth the money. Should try it
Very good and attracts a large number of lunch crowds. Recommended
"Quite fix, quality pork with flavourful blend."
nice kuay chap
"Fen Liang Hen Zu,Jie Ge Gong Dao,Qiang Li Tui Jian!"
Great selections amd ample parking.  No gamely smell.  Just abit out of the way.
For those who's dont mind exortic cusine where mind decide but it look most internal kind of things
"I like this place for its quantity and quality of the pig organ soup. The soup is flavourful and delicious, the chilli sauce is simply perfect and generally it is value for money at $3.50 per bowl plus $0.50 for the rice.
The serving is extremely generous to say the least. Worth a trip there to try it out..."
Hao Chi You Bian Yi
One of my favourite Pig's Offal soup places.
One of the food Gem in that area.
"Malaysian style soup base(more herbal) for their bak kut teh, but the herbal taste is not too overwhelming. Thier kway zup is not bad too!"
nice n cheap food in woodlands
"Food is decent. Kway Chap is better than the Pigs' Organ soup, I feel."
Good and affordable
"Very tasty soup not overpowering with the star manis or some other herbs
Large & small intestines very clean
Very springy pig's skin & not too thick like some others
The kway-chap is enuff for one's fill
Good chilli to go with too
Not pricy at all..."
Taste good reasonable price
"Nice Kway Chap, juicy and tender pig's trotters."
"The braised pork was done a little softer than I like. But, the flavour was nice - it was mildly herbal sweet savoury. The flavour was infused from braising stock made with soy sauce, Chinese 5-spice and herbs. The kway or rice sheets were generic but thin and smooth. The subtly sweet rice sheet took on some of the herbal sweet savoury flavour of the brown stock clinging to it. I like it enough to order a second helping of the kway"
Very nice kway chap and the innards... Highly recommended
Generous portions at reasonable prices. Will serve lean portions of the pig's trotters when asked.
Best and most delicious kway chap around.
"Best Kway Chap in Woodlands! Also go to the stall beside it, Char Siew, Roast Meat and Roast Duck are fantastic!"
Fantastic kway chup!
Good food!
The best bak kut teh I can find around my area
Delicious n simple food. Very efficient n polite too. Price is very reasonable!
"Tasty generous pieces , inexpensive , tender and tasty . The Kway is fine and delicious.

Will come again but I do like the one at Serangoon gardens market better."
"Kway chap, pig leg and the roast duck and pork stall beside it are the signature of this region."
"Must try the Kwap Chap, very nice compared to most Kwap Chap stalls in Singapore and their pricing is very affordable!

PS. Must also try the Char Siew and Roasted Pork Rice stall as well (just beside the Kway Chap stall), must go early before their roasted pork sold out quite fast! Both stalls offer delicious food that east-sider drive all the way there just to eat."
"First time eating at the new Kopitiam Food Stall. Ah Ma delicious M1 Specialty Meatball Noodles!!! As usual, the noodles and Meatball Soup were extremely flavorful. I was so hungry that I forgot to take photo of the food. I chowed them down in no time. Heh heh. "
They have many branches all over Singapore but this one was in Parkway Parade basement. I ordered the Yuan Yang which ordered 2 kinds of balls- fish ball and meat ball. I also ordered Mee Sua which has a surcharge of $1. Why? I didn't ask for fear of getting scolded. Anyway it was overpowered with vinegar and chilli which I asked for. Probably will ask them to tone down the next time. I liked both the fish balls and meat balls.
Tai Hao Chi Liao
"I enjoy this bowl of mee hoon kueh with additional vege at extra $0.70. It's hand-pulled and tasted home cooked. Don't be expecting those kind of strong flavoured soup, it is mild homecooked healthy taste. Total $4.70."
Best Mee Hoon Kuey!!!
$4 for a bowl of ban mian that comes with an egg. It's a steal! And it comes with big portion of ikan bilis. Shioks!
"The stall aunty was incredibly friendly. From time to time, you could even see her hand-tearing mee hoon kway in between preparing orders--a sign of the handmade care that goes into their dishes.

Ban mian soup ($4) - 7/10.
This comforting bowl of ban mian comes with a well-balanced mix of ingredients--egg, braised mushrooms, minced pork, and a generous serving of vegetables, all topped with crispy ikan bilis for added crunch.

The real surprise was the soup base which was made from fish maw stock. It provided a rich and robust flavour with a slightly gelatinous mouthfeel unlike the more common anchovy based broths.

Dry Mee Soon Kway ($4) - 7.5/10.
We were pleasantly surprised to find battered fried fish in our bowl--a unique addition that's not commonly seen in mee hoon kway. The batter was light and fluffy, though soft and slightly soggy, absorbing the sauce rather than providing a crispy crunch.

The dish featured a well-balanced mix of ingredients similar to the ban mian soup, minus the egg. The handmade, hand-torn dough pieces had that signature chewy, slightly elastic bite, soaking up the flavors of the dark sauce while remaining satisfyingly firm. A side of soup accompanied the dish, light yet umami-rich, offering a comforting contrast to the dry-style noodles.

Fried Fish soup with Ee Mee ($5.50) - 7/10.
This bowl came with a generous serving of fried fish, paired with springy ee mee, making for a hearty and comforting meal. We opted to add milk, which added a creamy richness to the soup, balancing out the naturally savory flavors from the fish stock.

The fried fish pieces were tender, with a light, slightly softened batter that absorbed the broth's flavors well. Sliced bitter gourd was also included, adding a subtle bitterness that contrasted nicely with the creaminess of the soup, preventing it from feeling too heavy. The ee mee, with its signature springy texture, held up well in the broth, soaking up the umami-packed flavors while still maintaining a slight chew."
Really good mee hoon kuay. I ordered the tomyum MHK and it was packed with ingredients. So yummy!
"Gonna be honest, comparing the two fish soup stalls here, I would rather patronise this stall, not only is the price worth the portion, the ingredients are fresh and overall the soup was delicious, lastly the service by the lady was friendly as well, would highly recommend"
"Bought the standard  $4 ban mian. V generous with all the ingredients - ikan bilis, vege and bak chor. Just a tad salty (for me)."
"First time patronising on 21 Jun 24 at 6 pm.i was surprised there was no shocking queue as it was a TEL stage 4 open house day.  The broth is quite thick but it was not the most savoury I had.  It has a tinge of fishy taste.  But ingredients wise it was pretty good.  I bought Yu Mian at 4 dollars.  It was a hearty meal.  The man who served me though is typical hawker guy and not very welcoming.  Quite rare to find someone who serve with a smile.

On a side note I had two good conversation during the meal.  One with an Indian LTA staff and another one with artist Lily Tan who was responsible to make balloon sculptures of the MRT thoughtful bunch mascots."
"I'm from KL, so I know what a perfect bowl of dry Mee Hoon Kueh is supposed to taste like, and this was surprisingly pretty good, not as good as what I would find back at home but still satisfying tastewise nonetheless.

However I felt that the portions were WAY too tiny, I finished my meal in under 5 minutes. Hopefully they can improve on that."
"Have been a returning customer and I tried both their dry and soup mee hoon kueh on multiple occasions. They do not compromise on quality and you can witness Aunty hand-pulling the mee hoon kueh homemade dough, which gives it its signature chewy texture, as opposed to store-bought mee hoon kueh. It's also a nice rarity to be given fried fish slices in such dishes. :)"
"Extra charge for empty bowls, even considering that we ordered multiple addons."
"Soup was very bland, like water + ginger. The amount of meat was so pathetic u can barely find any. Will not recommend, one of the worse i've tried"
"One of my go tos at Marine Parade hawker centre! Good chewy noodles, generous ingredients and excellent sauce."
"Have been patronising this stall for a while now, and have tried their ban mian back in 2020 and 2021 too.

Tried their dry ban mian again yesterday, since my regular ban mian stall (77 Ban Mian) was shut.

Have to say I quite liked the Ban Mian here. Chilli loaded at the bottom of the bowl, so make sure to mix it really well. The noodles are soft and well cooked.

This is served with shredded chicken, 3 pieces of fried fish, loads of anchovies, bok choy. For $4, ingredients are generous."
"Tried the soup and dry ban mian and mee hoon kuey, food is good and definitely value for money!"
"Ordered a takeaway ""ke kou mian"", firstly very affordable, secondly very tasty and delicious, lastly at this price you can eat till you full , highly recommended place to buy your lunch or dinner "
"Ordered sliced fish porridge. The fish here is a bit thin and easily breaks once the chopsticks pick it.

And it's quite expensive, normal sliced fish porridge should be $5. They are selling at $5.50 for the fish porridge.

Payment available:
CDC voucher, e-payment, grab, uob etc. , Cash payment."
"I had this ban mian almost twice a week, it just never disappoint me, the taste is always consistent."
Male boss a bit fierce; noodles are okayish
"After moving to Singapore, and trying a couple of hawker centers, we accidentally stumbled upon this gem of an eatery. And went for the Tom Yam Yu Mee....Ohhhh my Godddddd.....amazing amazing....delicious, and the best part was the huge portion and price....amazing cooking and amazing taste...am writing this after our 5th visit here "
"This place is amazing for several reasons
The chef is the owners mother herself!
The ingredients used are so fresh and home quality!
The quantity is perfect!
I would recommend her tomyum noodles which are to die for!!!
You can see the cooking is done so effortlessly with love by the owners mom !!!"
"Singapore best MHK in my humble opinion. Super generous with their portion be it noodle or ingredients. Unlike most stores in SG that uses machine for MHK, this store uses the traditional hand pulled method. Orders are all cooked to order but owners are efficient hence food were being served promptly. Owners are super friendly as well. Price is really affordable for the portion that was given. Will definitely patronise this store again!"
soup is fragrant. Friendly hawkers as well.
"Located at Marine Parade Central Food center. Operated by mother & daughter, dishing out piping hot soups & noodles to customers. Tried the fish head noodle soup. Order fried fish was given fish head soup instead. Soup was on the bland side, while the fried fish head was flavourful. Portion wise large can easily fill 1.5 person. Missing dash of wine and umami that make up a good fish soup base. Hope the feedback will help the stall to improve their dish."
"Had a very nice lunch at this stall : the ban mee was very tasty and HUGE portion for only 3,50 ! I really enjoyed the noodles, cooked perfectly
The lady was very friendly too "
"A hidden gem for no-nonsense home-style fish soup. Fish soups must first employ fresh and 'sweet' fish, which is what many stalls do not use. Many (famous) stalls over-marinate their fish, possibly to hide any fishiness from using fish not so fresh, until it loses the original taste and texture. In this aspect, Ah Zheng excels by using good batang fish. The soup is simple and tasty with tinge of tee-bou, and not too salty. It is not overwhelmingly complex or heavy in taste. Lots of vegetables as well - good for health-conscious people. Don't go for this if you like strong heavy complex tastes - this is not for you. Opens late for dinner, so you can slip in for a quick bite before the day ends."
Ordered fried fish soup. Generous with ingredients but the soup/ broth was a tad bland.
"Grabbed ban mian from this stall out of convenience and thought that it was really just alright. However, this was a takeaway experience and I would perhaps return to give it another shot to give it a fair chance. After all, it isn't difficult to mess up ban mian."
"Came here to eat after my friend had recommended to me! Have to say that they are very generous with their ingredients, and super affordable! Will come back again! Have been craving after that one time!!:)"
Interesting being the first to rate because the food was so much better than what I expected. Wanted a quick fix but was blown away by the scallop pork soup with noodles. Super generous in ingredients for 4.50. Nothing out of the world but extremely honest bowl of noodles for me.
You can pay your burger with card but not kebab. Weird!
Good selection of beers
Good food (wildly cheap) the pasta is actually decent....a lot better than the weird thing pasta you get at pasta mania! And the range of Trappist beer is fantastic.
"Every visit to Alibabar The Hawker Bar is elevated by the warm and attentive service provided by Min and Nay. Their dedication to creating a welcoming atmosphere is evident in how they remember returning customers, making each experience feel personalized and special.

Min's friendly demeanor and attention to detail ensure that orders are taken with care and delivered promptly. Nay's cheerful presence and efficiency add to the overall positive vibe of the establishment. Together, they contribute significantly to the bar's inviting ambiance, making it a favorite spot for many.

Their consistent excellence in service not only enhances the dining experience but also fosters a sense of community among patrons. It's staff members like Min and Nay who make Alibabar The Hawker Bar more than just a place to eat and drink, it's a place where customers feel valued and appreciated.

Kudos to Min and Nay for their outstanding service!"
Heaven for lovers of Belgian special beer.
Good comfort food.
Great  place .
"Tried a burger from the burger stall, kebabs from the Turkish one, and their craft beers. All were great and they have a nice selection of craft beers- the staff are great and happy to give recommendations for the beers. This place is set up like a food court and is a relatively cheap option in the otherwise pricey East Coast dining belt."
Good service from waiters & waitress
"Good beer, good service. The Mediterranean food is ok"
Highly recommended! 
"This place has been opened more than a decade ago and over the years it manage to keep it's customers coming in, even survive through the covid crisis which definitely tells about this place.
The hokkien mee has always been my favourite since so many years ago and the taste and standard is always the same. Nice broth with a strong taste of prawn heads, noodles are soft and not those doughy kind simmered in it's tasty prawn broth. The chilli is just nice, not too spicy, nice to go with the noodles. One of my favourite hokkien mee places to go, it's rich in its flavour and definitely has its own unique recipe.
The waitress selling the beers are also friendly, many varieties of beers from draft to bottled beers to cocktails etc, good place for a hangout. (4 stars for the hokkien mee and drinks stall)

However,  recently I tried the western stall beside the hokkien mee, the fries is ok though kind of pricey for it's portion of truffle, however what got me irritated was that when I ask for chilli or tomato sauce, the person just told me ""don't have, ran out of both"" which is ridiculous of how can you operate a western stall without the basic tomato or chilli sauce, what if I were to ordered a plain fries, does it means I will have to eat without any sauce? Any for goodness sake you could have told us before we order.  The truffle and cheese also wasnt mixed property, it's just chunks of it on the top layer of the fries with middle and bottom just purely plain fries(*2 stars for the attitude and service*)"
"Amazing location, good food options. Service is very quick and efficient."
Burgers and Mediterranean food are to sought for here. The most famous is the number of craft beer available. 70+ types now. Servers are often swamped by the number of recurring orders
"The perfect combination of cold beer (with good options) and tasty Mediterranean food. We ordered 2 types of Pint and chicken skewers with salad and hummus. The food is tasty, well seasoned and with an authentic flavor and the beer is cold and authentic."
A nice place for both the old and young to dine in. 
Heart of Katong. Best location.
"Top place and quality , one of my favourite place in Singapore"
"Hence Busog! Sarap! Ubos!

If you're looking for a winning dinner experience, Pete's is the place to be! Their skewers of grilled chicken are cooked to perfection, juicy and flavorful, and paired beautifully with a fresh and vibrant salad. To top it off, a cold Paulaner beer is the perfect complement to the meal. The atmosphere is another highlight--on a Thursday dinner time, the crowd is all professional, creating a lively yet relaxed vibe. Pete's truly nails it with great food, quality drinks, and an inviting ambiance. Highly recommended!"
"Wanted to watch the tennis final. They had 2 TVs showing a soccer match that no one was watching. Staff said it was not possible because it's too troublesome to switch channels. Ridiculous for a ""sports bar""."
"Great place for  beers and outdoor chill
Great service cheers"
"Great food &  drinks also,nice vews and good service"" smart staffs those."
"What a great concept for drink and food , I love this place  service stuffs are so friendly and welcoming us , happy to come and have my birthday party with friends. Cheers "
We have been served by Min always and we are very happy with the service. He is very good..
"One of my favorite coffee shops to patronize and I'm a regular there esp for the delicious hokkien mee . I come here a few times every month. Unfortunately the staff there has integrity issues/ lack attentiveness. I left a bottle of Aesop sanitizer on the table and instead of keeping it aside for me , the staff who picked it up simply chucked it at the bar beside the utensils ( I knew cos she was looking for it there when I returned to check), and then it was missing.

I'm thoroughly disappointed as all it took was for them to safeguard it temporarily as there's a good chance customers do return for high value items . So that bottle of Aesop is now either taken by a staff who lacked integrity or stolen by a customer who saw it at the bar counter. That bottle cost $20 for goodness sake"
The service is excellent and vibe is just nice
Have been coming here regularly for almost two years. I will not be visiting again as they allow dogs to sit on the tables and the high rise chairs. If you want a doggie bar there are plenty locally.
Wild and very affordable selection of beer and wine with no service charges. Staff are very friendly and helpful but will require abit effort to understand their accent.
Great buzz and relaxed vibe. Located in a happening neighbourhood. Have a few drinks and head out to a plethora of eateries on the same street. Limited options on drinks and food but great service and friendly staff.
Great good and friendly staff .
"Literally on a corner of the busiest and most vibrant intersection on the East coast between Joo Chiat and East Coast rd it offers 4 different food (aka Hawker bar) vendors to cater to everyone's taste and a very decent bar with a good selection of draft beer and bottled beverages.

Somehow the hustle and bustle and even the road noise seems to add to the experience."
Great place. Fun ambience.
A good variety of diff food options. I enjoyed the truffle mushroom and pepperoni pizzas.
"It's a go-to for when you want to relax with a drink but don't want anything fancy. Placed, at one corner of east coast road [opposite I12 Katong], it can boast of a fun atmosphere.
Love the falafel from one of the counters, though it's a tad expensive. Wide choice of beers."
"This mainly serves alcohol and beer and has the best collection of beers and wine.
You can get food from the stalls close to this place.
Amazing atmosphere with some live screening of sports.
Wonderful evening spot to chill and watch the city pass by."
Nice authentic hokkien prawn noodles
Hokkien mee was tasty. Not many people ordering hawker food though. Mostly here for the drinks.
I enjoyed the food so much and the costumer service was great definitely going back.
The place to go to if you love Belgian beers 
Hummus doesn't come with pita bread but a wrap. You pay for tap water. The food quality is according to the price
Great place to chill over a couple of beers. Good location & friendly staff makes it a popular joint.
"Always, the sunshine smiles of the nicest gentlemen here keep me coming back for a drink."
"Great service, food and experience. We will be back, thank you Emerald for taking such good care of us!!
David"
"This place is superb, amazing and an ambiance excellent! I cannot wait to stop here when we visit Singapore again. Kudos to the amazing staff, keep it up guys! "
Interesting concept! Delicious Mee Sua! Friendly staff Min and Nic!
Relaxed place for some drinks and Hawker food.
good mix of local and western delights
"Nice selection of Belgian beers, mostly in bottles. Outside seating, you'll sweat."
"Nice modern hawker ambience to dine and drink. I tried the Roasted Pork Hokkien Mee and Fried Mee Sua. The food is tasty, but a bit salty (especially mee sua) which may be suitable for drinking crowd.

#Updated review# (2 years later)
The half-boiled eggs were also nice. I'd also recommend the biscuits, which are unique and delicious."
"Lousy service. I have leg pain and the staff did not come take order. Saw us waving but stood behind the counter, looking around but did not come take order. Unprofessional. In the end have to walk to the counter and its been a couple of times now. Elderly don't feel welcome."
"Good vibes and good food! 4.5/5 stars!

The hokkien mee is okok. Wet kind and the sauce was not bad. We shared $8 for 2 pax.

The pizza stall sells REALLY GOOD sourdough truffle pizza for $16! Omg cheesy and rich and hot. They gave so much truffles I got sick of it towards the end!

Place also has huuuge selection of craft beers! My red by Petrus (fruity beer) for $14++ was so expensive but tastyyyy. ""Like wine and beer had sex and made a sweet baby"" yeah tastes damn classy."
"The food is great, but the service here is not acceptable at all. There is this Vietnamese (I think) lady server who literally won't let us order drinks unless we head up to the counter to ask her. I just witnessed 2-3 tables having the need to go up to her while she just walks around and hide behind the counter. The poor uncle had to walk to the bar with a limp to order drinks. This is probably more than 3 times when I saw this lazy service from AlibaBar. No initiative and poor attitude. Very disappointing.

Updated on 9 May 2024 to the admin reply that staff is passionate: This is based on my experience with lady staff - male staff is great.

This is aligned with the other reviews below about the service. I hope the estalishment can accept feedback gracefully, nurture the staff and not invalidate your customers experience."
Italian store staff hates his life. I had to beg him so I could order fries
"Cosy and convivial bar, food and service crews' passion were contagious."
Nice alfresco bar vibe. Variety of food options that satisfies most craving - from comfort fried hokkien prawn mee and char kway teow to italian and mediteranian.
"nice corner spot to have a drink, hang out and people watch. lots of food options too."
Peaceful place for a casual drink
"I ordered pork hokkien prawn mee. Instead of doing the new set, the lady boss took 1 cold set that have been putting one side (standby) and just recook / warm up in front of me. I will never buy again."
"Great place to sit and watch people go by.
Nice food and drinks"
For casual dining and drinks. Good for hangout. Not suitable for kids since no aircon.
"I believe all Easterners would know this place. But perhaps not all can recall that it was not a baR but Ali Baba Eating House with a stall selling tau kwa pau. This place has a certain draw with its variety of crowd, a few stalls with a variety of food, and of course a range of beers and wines to chill and relax any time of the day."
Perfect place to chill and enjoy truffle pizza 
"My favourite place to sit outdoor in the evening for drinks, good hokkien mee and people watching. Wine is decent, great prices, members get 10% discount off liquor, nice vibes, staffs are always friendly and the hokkien mee is amazing! Tomyum fried rice was excellent too."
Have been eating the hokkien mee for years. But now the price has gone up to $6 and the portion has shrunk so much. Change in operator and uncle has retired. Guess I'm not returning anymore.
Thai you up has the best thai basil rice i've ever had tbh. my colleagues and i are regulars there. i recommend getting the thai basil chicken with 2 eggs and the spring rolls. the staff are also very accomodating to our specific orders
Nice vibes. Food was alright but prices on a slightly high side.
"Beer lovers,
Need to check availability on tap"
When you really don't want to make any effort thinking for a drinking hole...this one should be it..can't go wrong..it has some great food options too. Love Pete's Mediterranean food.
"Kind of a blend between a bar and coffee shop. There wasn't any air-conditioning when I was there. Only tried the char kway teow so far, it was so-so. The alcohol selection and prices seem fine though"
Food is ok.. Service sucks big time. Waitress showing attitude face when ask where is our change. 1st time replied.. Please WAIT.. after 10min ask her again. She ignore and walk past. Shop not busy with only 3 tables. I don't think I am unreasonable.
"Obviously a hidden gem in Katong area, didn't expect it to be a bar and yet it serves some good quality Belgian beer  there. Definitely will come back for more."
Not the usual kind of bar you go to. Its a hawker bar but more like a coffee shop bar. You still order your food at their individual food stalls even though they had their menus on the table for you to look at. The waiters are only available to order drinks. Tried the Japanese sake on promotion which was better than expected. Alightly sweet so would be good for beginners to try. The food are ok.
"Really great place for a drink! Nice selection of beer and wine. When we were there, there was this waiter named Sachin who is very helpful and provided great service. Very patient guy as we took quite a while choosing wine. He even recommended us some wine that was not even on the menu yet. Would definitely go again!"
Great hawker - a bar with 4 food outlets.
Great place to hang out with friends at heritage district. Wide selections of wine and food to please any palate.
Good place to go if you just want to have some beers before heading for something else or even after
V good char kway teow!!!
Oyster omelette is a must-eat. Lamb wrap and the local coffee is also good.
This place provide many beer variety and very nice beer.. you can also choose many choice of food here..
"We ate at Pete's for 2 consecutive nights.

We ordered big platters, and all I can say is it's really worth coming back.

While I can say that service can be improved, I couldn't complain because it is a hawker anyway and the price range is very reasonable compared to the delicious meal.

The atmosphere of the place has a lot of potential."
Staff are friendly. Food and drinks are great.
hokkien mee is flavourful. only 3 beer on tap available though menu lists about 8.
"Rating for the Hokkien mee $6 and the very value local iced americano (ie kopi o sd peng) at $2.

Great location and love that they do try to keep the price affordable (Esp for the area). Also the seats outdoors are pet friendly albeit are high tables."
Qing Song Qie Yi De Di Fang!Pi Jiu Pin Zhi Hen Bang!
"Been here a couple of times but only for the Hokkien mee. Pretty decent with good flavour and wok hei, just that the protein option is inconsistent... supposed to replace siu yuk for sotong, but sometimes it's just fish cake for the same price.

Quite like the vibe, but the sports from the TV can be a little bit loud for the afternoon chill vibe."
Great place with a unique vibe
Amazing food
I had a vegetarian falafel wrap ($12) at ~10pm at night. It was delicious! The falafel were soft and the garlic sauce was rich and flavourful! A little bit on the pricey side but a really good wrap :)
Good place to chill
A great place if your looking for a casual bar with some good quality casual food options. They have a nice selection of beer and soft frinks and the place is nestled amongst the walkways and road crossing so up close to the hustle of activity
"Good food selection so everybody in the group can find something for their taste, liked the vibe! This place used to have vide beer selection, now they just have the same old draft beers and few more interesting bottles beer selections. The saddest thing that they just want to sell out old beer with promotion, probably which is already out of date by scratching ""best till"" date."
Good place for chilled relax in evening.
My favourite is the Hokkien Mee with Roast Pork.
Decent food and lots of drink selections.  Many beers on draft to try. Good atmosphere with open air seating.
"Biscuit burger is very good, moist and buttery."
Nice place
"Probably the best fried prawn noodle I had in SG, plus it's SGD8 only

The chilli is just nice 

I will try out Pete's Grill next time"
"Love the vibe. Food was decent. But it was the vibe that was interesting for me. Right in the heart of Joo Chiat, good for people watching or just soak up the quaint air of the area."
"Very enjoyable evening at this prominant  lacation at Katong, my wife very happy with the service provide and the enviriment atmosphere, dedicate waiter Chandra is very very friendly .Cheers"
"Wow Katong has changed a lot in the last few years with all the grimy places all gone, but one thing that hasn't changed in years and years is Alib's! Cheep beer, cheap and yummy food and a really chill vibe. Sit and drink your night away"
"Pete from the kebab stall served us the wrong food from another table. Then asked us to top up the difference when he found out (one beef skewer!). When we told him we didn't think we should pay for his mistake he took my partner's plate to remove the skewer from it. A disgrace, will not be returning."
"i am a regular here, the kebab shop is the highlightx and the beer, although if it were 1-2 degrees colder it would taste even better in the warm Singapore climate.

it can get a little crowded but it's also part of the charm and culture of Katong/Joo Chait

i won't mention the v.i.p. programme"
"Great service here, very attentive staff. They have a wide selection of beer which I really like. The other drinks like Teh and Kopi are not bad too. The fruit drinks are however bland and watered down.

Got a decent number hawker like stalls for food choices here."
"Loved the food and lots of choices from Chinese, Thai and even Mediterranean:)"
One of the worst house wine I ever had was at this place. They had $10 Italian Rosso wine which was so bad that i had bad cough immediately after having it.
They have huge range of beers and food that go along with it.
It's a nice place to chill. Lots of options for drinks and food. I always go here if I'm in the East Coast or Katong area.
Cheap drinks andfriendly staff! Love this place
"Good ambience, variety of drinks options, and great food!"
"Good selection of beer. The food stalls serve good food, and the place has a good vibe. Outdoor seating is the best for people watching. The breakfast is really bad, and don't bother trying it out."
"Perfect spot to stop for a cold pint and a snack! Great view and Katong vibes, good food, lovely staff. The savoury scones/biscuits are excellent!"
Wide selection of beer
Liao Li gasaiko
Ordered and received 3 jugs of beer. The servers insisted we ordered 4 and made us pay for 4. Asked them to check cctv but they were not able to resolve even after more than one hour. The way this was handled leaves a very bad taste in the mouth
Good beers
Yes it was good theirs good food all around
"Yeah to be honest, I really like this kind of conceptual f&b business along this estate.
Put it simply:
1. Easily seen location, right at corner of joo chiat rd and opposite katong i12 mall
2. Park opposite i12 and cross over
3. Opens daily and closes 1130pm or 1230mn (on fri/sat), means if you crave for supper you know where to fall back on
4. Variety of chinese local, thai, western cuisines. Not super variety but hey good enough for passerbys to drop by and try. Hokkien mee, char kway tiao, spicy chicken burgers, pad thai.. etc
5. Variety of drinks too - beers , traditional coffee   or fruit juices.
6. Affordable spending even for average income (maybe $8 - 15) depends what you order. We know this area estate is quite atas and usually where expats hang out. Yo it totally has local ""feels"""
"Hmm. Initially find the shop quite unique but hmm its quite messy when it comes to food ordering.
Food soso only
Will.not recommend this"
Lots of good food!
Thai food was good . Ask for less spicy tomyum.soup where the color was so red but was not spicy at all .
"First time I've basically been tricked by staff about the concept of ""two beers for one"".
Could been the staffs broken English but I asked twice about the this on beer menu.

Avoid"
Good place to chill..
Nice beers and pocket friendly multiple food options!
Pete Mediterranean food is awesome in this bar. Hummus and Falafel are amazing.
There's reasonable priced western breakfast here. They also do western lunch and dinners with orders from the bar. Conveniently located just across I12 Katong mall and other eateries along the street.
Good selection of food and drinks. Great value for money and attentive staff!
"An upmarket hawker bar. Came here for the fried prawn noodles and couldn't find it at first because we thought they have move! This place doesn't look like a coffeeshop or hawker stall at All. We thought it's a drinking place or hip cafe.

Many food selections inside, but getting a seat is difficult for diners, especially those with family. most seats are taken by drinkers who spend their night there.

Recommended to separate the drinkers and diners.

They have a strict Outside food not allowed policy.

Staff will help to clear tables, didn't see any return tray station"
Nice ambiance
"Been coming here many times over the years.
""It's A Great place for local ""hawker"" food , coffee or even a cold beer and food in afternoons or evenings."
"Very nice place , alibabar"
Got the burger and it was a bit oily
"Prompt service, Great food."
"A good place to enjoy different style hawker food.

Hamburger, hummus, beer, sweet pancake .....
(Pancake is not good though....)"
Great selection of beers and food along with affordable wine
Nice staff and very we'll selected beer!! The hawker concept is a great idea 
"They just sweep and mop while we were still drinking inside the restaurant. Very annoying, could have informed us to move to outside seats if they were in such an urgent need to clean the floor. This was done even way before they asked us for last order. This is the first and last visit to this restaurant! Very bad dining experience!!!"
"Authentic chill, watching bypasses and snazzy cars screams by ....  to pass time ..."
"Good beer uniquely go with local kway teow zi char at generous serving, served timely and good price. The famous Mediterranean food just expensive and taste n serving not worth the long wait and money."
Good variety of food to choose from.  Cosy place and polite staff.  Huge selections of crafted beers and wines. Parking spaces available at I12.
"It houses difference stores that sell western, Thai, local delight like hokkien noodles. Ordered the spicy chicken burger which very spicy, I like spicy food. The portion is near to twice the size of Mac big Mac burger. The price is $14."
"CS:1/5  FOOD:3.5/5  PRICE: 3/5

Arrived 1915ish, was told no table. No fuss, got ushered to bar seats. 2 of the 4 legs of the seats were on a metal platform, Shaky as hell. Requested changing seats.

Stuffy, squeezy and music were really loud.

Ordered Prawn Tanghoon, Mooping, Swordfish burger with truffle fries.
Buzzer rang, went over to take Thai food first. Prawn Tanghoon was served with claypot. The whole pot was burning hot. Was left on the counter top for myself to shift onto the tray.
- Prawn Tanghoon was pleasantly alright. Prawns were alright too, not the freshest but it was acceptable.
- Mooping tasted like chicken nuggets with some sweet sauce over it.
- Swordfish burger was really fishy for me, but my girlfriend enjoyed it.
- Truffle fries saved the day."
"Great place with good food and drinks. Prices are reasonable too. I like the ambience of the place as it is cosy. You can have drinks with friends or bring your family there for dinner. I especially like the kebab food store there, delicious and unique."
"Great place for food and drinks. The drinks are reasonable priced and in terms of food there is Lebanese, Thai, burgers and more..."
"Friendly staffs, top-notch service. Super chill vibe with different varieties of food to choose from!"
Great service and a great place for Belgian beer.
Unique bar with hawker set up! I like it..
"Cool place, food variety is limited and drinks are average. But the ambience of dining at a non - air conditioned shop at the junction of busy and small roads is an experience."
Not bad just beer is from german
"Inexpensive (relatively) food, great selection of wines, beers and ciders, friendly and chatty staff. One of the nicer places to hang out along East Coast Road. Also, a few labels of spirits at amazing prices (for takeaway only though). Kudos to the staff: Kay, Charles, Prabu, Fish and Tong for always being so warm and happy. Not always an easy job but they make it my go-to place for dinner."
Quite a nice place to chill with a cold pint and do some people watching. Plenty of beer grub and cheap eats. Bar prices are really affordable too. Only gribe is it can get really crowded. Oh that and no parking.
Very friendly staff and good selection of food and drinks!
Great food and drinks together with suberb service. Strongly recommended
The spicy drunken Thai noodles were great and a dark German beer to cool them off!  Sidewalk cafe and people watching on the corner of Joo Chiat/East Coast Rd.
"Very toight coffeeshop, very crowded. Hard to navigate, demands very nimble legs and feet, ESPECIALLY if you're sitting outside. The rain shelter ramp will obstruct the tall fellas from sitting outside, sorry if you are one.

But the food makes up for it. The Hokkien Mee stall is very generous with their roasted pork for an $8 platter. The drinks are surprisingly similar to that of what you would find at your neighbourhood (provided you not living in Katong ah)."
service was gd...but hokkien mee was soso....go further down towards Emo there has better holkien mee at e kopitiam
"Better be DRINKING if you're here. Ordered Kopi C + lime juice and it never came. Cleaner has to sweep under my table, knock my feet and hit my chair while we were finishing up our food. I get it, you don't want me here. See you never.

Hang on, I don't remember getting Trace-Together verified by anyone when I checked in."
"Average food at restaurant prices. Wide selection of drinks, but the food here is really overpriced. Would visit elsewhere for food before coming over for drinks."
Good wide spread of food choices PLUS you can have a decent beer with your meal too!
"Best Thai food for the price tag, made fresh to order!"
"Been here a few times. Chill out location, affordable wine & dine, chilling out to local flare like Hokkien fried noddles & Turkish meat platter, affordable wine or beer. This place have a lively atmosphere which I admire most. Cheers."
"Tasty lamb and Beef with hummus, it is peppery if you like it, olive oil.
Must give yourself a try."
Nice set of beers!
"Hokkien mee is the dry type. Honestly not much flavour, weak broth, weak seafood taste. Quite a few pieces of the noodles are burnt also, didn't add well to the overall taste. Came with 2 prawns that were quite sizable, take note that they are not peeled. No beehoon, only yellow and white thick noodles. Lower than average taste."
Decent prices and huge beer variety. Due to its compactness it's hard to chat / spread. But it makes up for that with its beer variety. Good place.
"Was at Alibabar's last night, was rainy but felt cozy. Ordered koftas from Pete's grill. Would recommend to have the chicken, then beef and lastly lamb, because the intensity of the taste increases with each meat. The hummus is a must have. The draft beers were not bad and they have a great selection of Belgium bottles. Overall had a great time "
Best Kebabs (Pete's) in Singapore! The Hokkien noodles are great! Beer selection is good but some items overpriced. Great place to hang out with some friends. No need reservations but sometimes is super crowded.
"A good mix of affordable and not so cheap food. ca mix of western, thai, mediterranean and local delights."
Just bought the so call good hokkien mee from review.
The Kebab is delicious besides the Hokkien Mee 
Good food available!
Thai food is amazing. Tom yum and vermicelli noodles highly recommended .
They are having a clearance sale at the moment
Nice food.
Good and decent price. They are opened for breakfast. Breakfast set is good and value-for-money. I come early so I can find seats.
Nice place and nice foods 
Great coffee too!
Amazing food and beers! Love Pete's wraps. My personal favourite is their falafal wrap
"It's kind of a Eurasian place with mix of hawker and Western food influences. There's selection of Mediterranean food, Mexican and Thai food with gourmet burgers, drinks and possibly viewing sports on the right day. The stalls are self service and drinks are served on table by the always attentive servers. Hummus and Kebabs with rice (loved the rice) options are really good. Burgers are alright (don't like the bun, meat is good) with a vegetarian option (sweet potato patty), which was interesting in a good way. A lot of other options for vegetarians as well. Tacos are definitely a must try."
Nice vibrant place to visit on a Friday night. Great service even full house. Will be back.
Excellent for bicycle rides and family walks during the evening s.Great hawkers food too.
Reasonable price for what you get
"Good and nice, feels like I am in Thailand"
Love the Mediterranean and Thai food. Wide variety of beer! Customer service is not bad either.
"Plump waitress (not fat) service pretty crude and obviously untrained. Look like Filipino type. Can't tell with mask. Asked her to recommend any fruity fragrance beer, she said a Sweet Water Pale Ale that tasted awful. In fact a large monitor above us having promotions on fruity beer she didn't bother to tell us. Served us beer in a bottle without a glass. Asked her for serviettes but she noted but didn't bring to us. I have to ask another guy for it. Won't be back."
Great time thanks to Kulpit for great service.We came in a little late about 9:30 pm and he did mention they had to stop alcohol by 10:30pm.Very firm but manage  to get us our meals and drinks.Two bottles of wine.Thsnk u again my friend
friendly staff. Good spot
"Great concept. Affordable and delicious food, and drinks. Very friendly and attentive waiters who never forget to come and check on you.
A bunch of craft beers to choose from. Wine bottles are on a crazy promo on some days.
Absolutely loved their kebab stall, generous serving won't leave you hungry. Kebabs are juicy."
Good mix of alcohol and food options
We always support Alibabar hwaker East Coast service is very good staff are very friendly and also the owner. I hope the time limit got extended. thank you .
Chill place with nice food but alcoholic drinks abit high priced for a 'coffee shop'.
Love the viet wanton mee and the turkish food there!
Good selection of beers!
"Thai food was amazing! Great portions and service. Tutu was a pleasant server, we will be back!"
"Hi - my mate & I always come here for our fill of Duvel, we come here 2-3 times a week, we love the place, the staff and the location.

But...please do offer some snacks like peanuts or something with your beers...the only thing that makes us move away is the lack of snacks. Please do provide some good snacks for us to have with our beers, to keep our bums on the seats and spend more money with you :)

Thanks! See you soon..."
"I'd describe this as half Singapore hawker style and half western, with a great mix of food including a burger and taco bar. Location wise is right on a corner, perfect for relaxing outside and watching the world go by. The bar has some great choices of beers, at reasonable prices too."
"Amazing selection of Belgian beers, at the right price."
nice place with good service and food
"After picking a beer from their impressive selection it's time to kick back and watch. There's some fine people watching to do here. Drivers, bicyclists, walkers, commuters, shoppers, and runners continue to go by.

The high top stools along the street is where you want to sit."
"nice chilled out place, great for drinking and snack"
Nice chilled atmosphere. Smokers friendly. Reasonable food
more of a place to have a couple of drinks and chill rather than a meal. Food was just average
"Located at the start of joo chiat street. We really liked this place and its vibe especially in the evening.

Their craft beers are really nice and they have a happy hour promos One for One.

We ordered Veg Nachos, Nachos were nice and crispy but I wish they had chicken Nachos on the menu. They are good to have along with your drinks.

For Mains we ordered Thai Basil Chicken and Omelette. Both were decent dishes, Omelette was really nice and fluffy should order next time."
"Good hangout place... needs to maintain its cleaniness... good place hangout on weekends .for food,  I usually prefer the chicken kebab rice in the Mediterranean joint.There are veg options available like Falafel wraps with hummus."
Chill place with good food and beer options...
Relaxed place to enjoy a few beers
"Very good range of beer with good accompanying chinese food like kway tiao, hokkien mee etc. Will prefer to go to this location from evening onwards so that it won't be so warm"
"The only traditional stall selling noodle, Hokkien mee and char kway teow is retiring.  A new owner is taking over but cooking skill not as good.  There are 2 western food and 1 Thai food stalls.  The drink stall sells many diff beers and upmarket juices (like avocado smoothie)."
Simple place with beers and finger food.
Delicious fare. Good outdoor place.
"Just finished a meal there! I read online that this stall is closing at the end of August and i had to go try. So i became the tour guide and brought my parents along heh heh.

We all order the normal portion (the $5 one) and i added the Zhu You Zha myself. The $5 serving has three prawns.

The taste of this hokkien noodle is really something. Not too dry or wet and no fishy smell. The noodles and ingredients really fresh. The chilli is not the sweet kind and it has a great sting. They have the chopped red chilli too. This is also the first hokkien mee that i ate and does not leave any after taste in the mouth.

It is really good and highly recommended. Negative point is the long queue loh. Cos many flocked to the stall after learning that it is closing soon and i queued for a good 35 mins before i can order. But then i went on a Sunday so maybe crowd on weekdays is different."
Nice place to eat
"Service and selection of drinks is great, lovely location too. Unfortunatly had a bad experience
with the Mediterranean stall. Gluten makes me bloated so I asked if I could get the falafel dish and swap the bread for some hummus. The guy at the counter said I could get 2 separate dishes (hummus and falafel) so I explained I didn't want 2 dishes, just to swap the bread for some hummus. He got angry and said 'just do what you want'. I saw he was upset and apologized if I offended him and that wasn't my intention and I was just asking a question. He replied that I was very forceful in my asking. I apologised again and said I may have had difficulty convaying my message when wearing a mask, and that I was just asking because in some places they will adapt the menu and if I don't ask I won't know. He replied that the bread was free anyway, but he could have swapped if the meal had cost $20 instead. He was obviously annoyed so I left. I'm still reflecting how I could have managed that situation better. But really almost everywhere I go in SG can adapt there vegetarian dishes to be gluten free so I didn't think it was an unfair question. A simple explanation on why they couldn't (if that was the case) would have sufficed, and I have accepted this in many other places. When I explained this situation to my friends they say they got the same attitude from the guy which is why they didn't go a second time."
Good place to tell people youre having 'lunch' but getting drinks on instead with your mates
I'm purposely coming down to eat the Fried Hokkien Mee and Char Kway Teow. It is highly recommended by my ex- school mate. Heard that the stall owner going to retire. So my hubby and I regardless the rain took our bike to Alibabar. There was no regrets.
Good beers and great food
"All the stalls are great. Gonna miss Yong Huat when they retire. IMHO, the best Hokkien Mee in Singapore."
"Good beer, and great food, makes you want to come get a drink."
Food portion are big & food are great
Loved the beer and also the Hokkien Mee stall
Great beer.. Food is ok
"This cost around $14, not so cheap for hawker food but I love the kofa beef"
Good food court concept in Singapore
"Good food, great staff."
Love the hummus  large selection of beers 
Arabic is very. Wide choice of beers
"Drink stall too pricey. Other than that, Superb char kway teow!"
"Everything closed around, so when coming back from a sporting event is good to have an option to eat. The portion was big, while the taste so and so, but definitely enjoyed the beer options."
"Its a decent place to hang with friends or a causal date. I had their flagship 'snakebite', which is a mix of beer and cider, and was really nice. You get some bar food such as mozzarella sticks, fries, quesadillas etc. as well."
The fried mee suah was really tasty with nice smoky flavour 
Satisfactory
"Wide variety of draft beers with a variety of different food choices... importantly the service is excellent and rustic environment.
Had a great time here."
Nice place to hangout. Wide range of beers.
Great spot for a beer and people watching plus awesome sports coverage
Nice Turkish food
Like the ambiance and food selection
Good and cheap food
Good place chill
Great Place.
First time there. Service n food very good although we were there passed their closing hour.
Nice & cosy
"Gd choices of craft beer. Spoilt for choice. Didnt know which to drink and ask for recommendations but wasnt fantastic. The ones we choose ourselves have been better.

Maybe its just a taste preference ."
"AlibabaR Hawker Bar East Coast is one of the best places one can come to for good food and drinks for a relatively cheaper  price. Located in East Coast Road, which is home to a large amount of eateries, AlibabaR offers a wide variety of Asian, Mediterranean and middle eastern cuisine.
The Middle Eastern cuisine is what I recommend the most. The person serving it is extremely friendly and sweet. The food is cooked and served in an immaculate way and is extremely scrumptious. 10/10 must try."
"Great drinks. Good food, low prices"
Good nostalgic place for a quick chill
Chilling places
Location was ok. But food not so
"Sells beer on the tap. Good beer. Variety of food choices. Tho char kway teow is at s$6, it was very delicious. Absolutely enjoyed it."
Lot of beers variety and also food very delicious very nice place for drinking in Singapore
Great service staff
I love the Hokkien mee. Will try their other offers next time.
"Friendly, cheap and clean. Good location"
"Mice tasting food, but it was cold."
Only had beer and watched rugby. Good service.
The thai basil rice was better before...
Food is nice
"Appalling service. The Burger Bar  patty was dry on the outside, despite being pink on the inside. It lacked juice of any sort, despite being a $10 burger. When my dining companion asked how long the food would take, the staff gave him an incredulous look, as if paying customers had no right to ask how long it would take. One of the service staff also charged us $95 instead of the $25 our drinks bill was. It was probably a genuine mistake, but it was just the straw that broke the camel's back. This place doesn't seem fantastic."
"Food is great with a good selection of beer to choose from. Service is the part that needs improvement. Service tends to be slow and there was once even after I complained about a draft beer being stale, the server didn't even know how to react. That was a real bummer."
Had phalaphila veg roll .. not too tasty
"A mini food court with 3 stalls and a beer delivering a good mix of local food favs and a decent range of craft beer from around the world.
A great stop for some lunch or dinner and craft beer, friendly staff and decent pricing makes this a fine local dining place.
Some of the stalls vary in their hours of opening so check ahead of time."
"I think $9.9 for this is really poor and not worth the money, small portion and no any single side dish, I need to spend more money to buy something else to eat... not going to visit this stall anymore"
"Super convenient local bar and eating place with huge range of craft beers, local hawker, thai and other bar food."
Interesting concept with interesting food. Good diversity of food that isn't the easiest to get at your local hawker
Hokkien noodle and thai basil chicken.. the foods you must try if you go here
"Had the Cajun Chicken burger with truffle fries yesterday, for lunch. Unfortunately it didn't sit well with me. The chicken and the fried were both too salty for my palate. Lucky we had a Ginger beer to wash off that salt. I looked at the other tables, the Char Kway Teow looked more promising.

I liked the ambience of the place. We went during lunch time, still managed to get a seat. The place was kept cool with strong air coolers, thanks for that!"
Variety was very minimal
Always good! Char kway teow and mien xian...
Pete's Mediterranean Grill serve nice kebab food. affordable beer
The fried vermicillle is awesomeeeeee!!!! Must try!!
Coffee shop food and local atmosphere with reasonably priced beers by the jug!
"When walking down E Coast rd, happen to come to zaffron pretentious restaurant. Please do not stop there. Carrying on walking until you come to this place. Do order the Thai, Pete kebabs, prawn noodles. Not the drinks, bring your own. I did.
Best eating day ever.
Anyone into middle Eastern food, please order the hummus combo from Pete. Made fresh daily.
Yummy."
Fantastic chill place
Great selection of beers
"Horrible service from the bar counter. The fresh lemonade was non drinkable. It was so sour , like made from unriped lemon. Worst part was when we asked for sugar syrup they gave us water.  If they didn't have sugar could have just said that. I didn't expect such an unprofessional behaviour. Not going to order from there again."
Friendly and great service with a smile. Place was crowded but the service lady was tactful enough to clear tables for us by persuading some customers to move. Will be back.
Good food with wide variety of beers
My favorite fried mee sua stall @ Alibaba east coast..taste the wok hei. 
"Horrible burguers,lettuce was completely rotten. Meat is overcook and fries are soggy"
"It's easy, cheap simple on the side of the road, but has a good vibe. I like it"
Excellent beer selection. Love the sausages
Misleading menu. Food and wine different from menu. Don't waste your time and money.
"Kopi O - $1.40
Prawn noodle $5/-"
Average tasting hokkien mee. Good value for money though
Try Yong Huat noodles. I'm a fan of the fried mee sua although some find it too wet. Great atmosphere. Hawker place or bar? Both!
Kebabs are to die for with the draft beers.
"Loved the beer there, hospitality and enjoying people movement around the street"
So many beers to choose from! Even get to choose from a variety of food from different cuisines to snack on!
Good Hokkien Mee
The Thai stall needs improvement. The basil pork does not have any piece of actual basil. Every dish is overly salty.
A bit pricey for hawker food but portions and taste are great
The food was so so.
"The Thai place used to be really good, but they changed the chef and it's so-so now. The stand-out is the Hokkien Mee Char Kway Teow stall! Great smoky taste!"
Great place. Over 100 labels of beer from around the world. Dexent quality food. Street side seating for the ones who enjoy it.
Food is cheap and taste average. Fast service.
Thai wonton mee is very good!
"The uncle/aunty have been frying noodles at this corner for more than 20 years! Best char kway teow, fried mee suah and hokkien mee in katong.

Also nice that you can get a nice cold pint of draft beer at this coffeeshop."
"Taco, western food, pork neck, stew pork from Thai stalls are food. Kebab stall food is fabulous. Most of the  staff are friendly n gd service , One of them is Nesh."
Nice atmosphere
They have several stalls with non Singapore food that are good if you need a change of pace.  It can get very crowded though.
Great selection of beers!
"Love the coffee, thai fish cake, mee suah and grilled pork collar! No air con but fairly comfortable."
Seating here is slightly awkward and can be a tad bit warm at times. Beer from the bottle tends to be expensive but is more affordable from the tap. Have a great selection of beers if you're willing to pay to sample. Coffee shop setting avails cheap snacks and food while you drink.
Good choice of beer. Good service. The place is packed in the evenings.
The Hokkien Fried Noodles are one of the best around.
Very chill place for leisurely drinks
"Formerly an old time coffee shop that's been around the Katong area for the longest time and which has been given a new life having been converted into a bistro cum eating house with a small Al fresco area along the walkway facing Joo Chiat Road. There's local fare like fried Hokkien mee, char kway teow and prawn mee soup alongside western food, all which are very popular with the crowds both local and foreign, and they also serve beer from the taps as well. There's no air conditioning but strategically placed fans serves to ventilate the interior sitting area. Sports fans can also get their fix of ""live"" International football matches which are telecast here in the evening. A nice place to have a meal if the place is not overly crowded in the day, and pretty cool place to chill over a meal and drink in the evening."
"Drink and pair it up with a bowl of sumptuous Wonton noodle with their own special char Shu, half hardboiled egg, salted egg yolks crumbs, fried wonton and vegetables . Shiok!"
Great beer selection from all over the world. Nice atmosphere and good bar food.
"Very nice and tasty food!! (:

The beer tho... expensive and some flavours are... "
"Something like a food court in a corner coffee shop. Only tried the char kway teow (fried noodles) which was pretty good, and fish and chips. There's Western and Thai food too"
"Nice music, good food. Fun place to hang out"
Love the hokkien mee
"Let me start with good thing. Staff is really accommodative. Beer is fine compared to price.

BAD EXPERIENCE: never have food, it's frozen  and low quality food for high price."
"Best beer experience in the east. Many thanks to AlibabaR team for recommending me beer that suits my taste. Good food, good beer, good company. Nothing more I can ask for."
"The place had a nice atmosphere with a great range of beers.

However I spent $15.90 on the foie gras beef burger, and changed my sides to truffle fries for an additional $2.

The burger was small, and beef patty was dry and flavourless. The fries were hard and tasted like it was air fried. Did not taste like truffle at all, and there wasn't even any salt added.

Overall it was very disappointing, and honestly, McDonald's tastes much better. Best part about the place? Leaving."
"The amount of beer options stops you from making a decision, makes you feel like trying everything. Great place to try different kind of beers."
"Ok I got Warsteiner here. The worst beer I've ever had? Yeah I think so. I mean I get it, a place should have a range of beer, but this is so bad it shouldn't exist."
The floor is a little oily.
"The homemade drinks ruined it for me.

For a meal to taste great, food and beverage have to go hand in hand.

The place has an interesting menu but having ordered an ice coffee with extra milk. I was given the coffee with what looks like 1 teaspoon of milk.
After seeing it I immediately went over to the bar to ask for more milk. And yet was given a second teaspoon of milk from the grumpy old man making the drinks.

On top of that, upon returning to my table with my dark glass of ice coffee. I realised that the man at the next table, whom had ordered a normal iced coffee had a lighter colored brew than myself  further infuriating me.

I would've gladly given this place a generous score, if only I didn't have to eat my meal thirsty and frustrated."
"Kind of best place to visit
Manager (prateek ) and team  is the best people,
Today been there for friend's birthday celebration I had ever came across
Must visit
Cheap beer hahahahhah"
A total of about 32 kinds of premium beers to choose from price reasonable only is too near to the road. Overall nice place to chat with friends n staff r very helpful
"Must tried the fried rice, it is  good value for your money. Better than any other fried rice stall."
"Great price for beer
Cozy
Great mediterranean food "
"Like a mini coffeeshop with different stalls here. I like the Fried Hokkien mee stall & Thai stall. Prices are reasonable (one of the cheapest around the area). Limited seating so be prepared to wait for seats during peak meal times. Even so, seats are small, might not be very comfortable to sit for long"
Good late night option with decent selection of craft beers
Heart warming comfort food for all! A nice selection of beers to match as well.
Like the $20 jug beer promo and the affordable finger food as well as the ever attentive and hospitable staff.
Love the prawn noodles. Nice mix of styles and good beer selection
Local Singapore food
"Nice feeling of drinking and chatting place,"
Nice place to chill out
"Good atmosphere, nice beers."
Nice Hokkien mee.
"I enjoyed my experience. The food is good and the environment even more so. Hours go into the night. The best way to describe it is nothing less than comfortable.
Nothing more, nothing less."
"Enjoyed the kebabs and Mediterranean cuisine, falafel etc"
"Coffee shop that looks like a cafe. Relatively clean and cool place to have lunch. The prawn noodles, fried prawn noodles, char kway tiao and fried mee sua are all highly recommended. They have the wok hey taste. Very yummy and delicious. The teh I drank is nice too."
Found cockroach crawling on my table and food are awful. Cleanliness in the restaurant need to be improved and service from staff are below expectation.
Great Hokkien Mee
"Cool place that serves a range of great beers! Service staff was friendly and knowledgeable as well! Lovely atmosphere! If you enjoy watching football, this would be a great spot!"
Roadside Junction Pollution due to Heavy Traffic. Overpriced for Average Food Quality and Service.
Good place to chill with friends
Nice food n environment
Air cooler in the cafe
Un bar sympa sur Joo Chiat.
"Always swing by for the Hokkien Mee. Wet and savoury, the chili is the best. Standards can vary though, but mostly good. Recently, the amount of chili given seems lesser, but uncle is always happy to provide a 2nd helping if you ask nicely. If you're in the area, check this place out, especially now that the food court at I12 Katong mall is not operational and thus reduced food options that aren't restaurant or cafes."
Great thai food!
Good burgers and fries and root beer floats. Very filling.
Cosy place to be at and prices are reasonable. Food wise is average for me.
"Plenty of nice food here from the Mediterranean food, Thai Wanton Noodle, Western food and Hokkien Noodle/Mee sua!

Have tried from all of them and all are equally nice so I usually decide literally based on my mood of the day!

During the last visit, ate the tacos and Felt real healthy! Yummy tacos, abundant feeling and very good dinner."
"Good place to chill and relax, staff are friendly"
"Kebap small, no salsa, really not tasty, expensive. Place and waiters very nice."
Open until late nights. Nice place to chill for suppers.
Amazing ambience. Authentic Appetizers
Went at night. The Chinese food stall not open at night. Only tried the Thai food stall and kebab. Food is just average overall. Staffs are friendly.
"We went for the second visit to try the Fried Prawn Hokkien Noodle again. It tastes good, and I will definitely come back again to try their fried kwetiau. Also, we tried The burger and wanton Thai noodles. The overall burger will taste better if the bun not too dry and fries doesn't feel like frozen food. Do note this place has limited spaces. For parents, be aware that there will be limited space for a stroller."
Good spot to stop and cool off
"good mix of fast food, local and western with cheap drinks for a quick post shopping beer."
"Tried the beef bacon cheesy burger, was ok."
just love this corner coffee shop !
"Cool place to have a pint of german beer, with some cool hawker food. They provide some Thai food, local hawker food and Mediterrian food. Price is definitely affordable and the German Beer is quite good. Definitely worth it to check it out if you are in Katong."
Very wide beer selection
Good hokkien mee and Thai food
"It's a nice laid back place for beer and good food , I love the Hokkien mee place there . The Hokkien Mee stall has been there for very long . The burger stall is also fantastic . It's a great place for watching Football and there is always a nice crowd of beer drinks there ."
Kebabs are great! Nice ambience too!
"The ambience of the place had a pretty chill vibe. I ordered the western food and waited up to 25 minutes for the food to be prepped. The fish & chips that was on recommendation was definitely value for money. We topped up to change our regular fries to truffles fries...and the serving was abundant. However, the fries might have been too oily. So we couldn't finish them. Pretty interesting concept and it's just opposite the mall."
Host the best hokkien mee in town and friendly service staff
"Wide selection of beer mostly Belgian, local and American"
"The hokkien new is awesome! Tried the burger as well but the bun is dry and I couldn't finish it. The ambience is okay but there is no aircond so be prepared. It is nearby Birds of paradise, so after dinner you can get your ice cream fixed there!"
Good place to drink and people watch
Good food Good Drinks Affordable prices
"Good food, good beer selection.  Reasonable prices."
good for a couple of beer and some simple food. place is a bit cramped.
"It is located at the junction of Joo Chiat Road and East Coast Road.A new style coffeeshop
It looks like a cafe from the outside but sells hawker foods inside.Has 3 stalls plus a drinks counter.One stall sells Chinese local foods like fried Kway Teow, Fried Hokkien Prawn Noodle, etc, 0ne stall sells Thai Foods and Western Food and one stall sells Eastern Mediteranian Foods.The drink stall has a good selection of beers.Tasted the Thai food  and is not bad,the Back Peppered Chicken Chop is not so good and a plate of Mediteranian Chicken Rice was not so good also.The satay tasted not bad. Overall it is just ok.The prices are a little on the higher end.Parking might be a problem as the roadside parking lots are occupied easily and have to park at the mall across the road.The place is not big and is very crowded on Saturday,Sunday and Public Holiday evenings.

Dated :  05/09/2018 ( Wednesday )."
Great. Nice coffee n food. Place clean. Only must do same action to prevent birds fly in to attend customer food.
The fried hokkien mee and mee sua are good. Tried fried rice at the same store but it's so-so.
Conviently located opposite 112Katong. Interesting coffeeshop/bar concept. Food is good.
I go there regularly for the kebabs. Check out their newest menu item - spicy humus dip!
Just like ordinary coffee shop in the day
Good variety of alcohol n food at hawker prices
Good cider
Nice Beer and food + very friendly staff :)
This is a GEM. Can't disclose anymore.
Nice atmosphere to watch a match and enjoy a good pint. The food is pretty good too.
Nice atmosphere but food a bit plain
Super crowded stuffy and bad cable connection for showing of soccer matches.
"Love the lovely elderly couple, their hokkien mee and char kway still rock and cook the old fashion ways and been there for long long time"
The only good thing is the amount/variety of beer you can order. Thai and Western food isn't so great.
"Really quite poor service with unfriendly and aggressive waitresses telling me I can buy a beer but cannot stand at the bar.

A little consideration goes a long way.  Unfortunately, there was none here."
One of my favourite food joint
"I went down here with my friends on a Saturday night. And as we were a big group I was pleased when they were able to find us a table if I am not wrong there were 11 of us. I ordered a bowl of wonton noodles from the Thai stall. They wonton noodles were springy and yummy, the charsiew was flavourful and was sweet too, the crispy wonton give a delicious crunch to the noodles. Overall I was very satisfied."
"Good food, friendly staff."
"Not quite my sort of place - but late, hungry and thirsty ...well. Nice inexpensive Green curry (Thai-style) with rice. Beer? A little expensive - but a big range for the enthusiast (that's a recommendation, OK?)

Big crowd in for World Cup diving. Oh! Sorry. Apparently it is soccer? All seemed to be appreciative. :-)"
The char keow tiao here is good and vendor very friendly. Price of beer same price as pubs so considered expensive for the location. Western food is okay. Is agood place to settle your meal when u are in the area where prices are on the expensive side.
Nice coffee
The Fried Hokkien Prawn Mee! $5 for a giant plate. Make sure you share it! Unless you have not eaten for ages...since the dark ages.
Great selection of proper ales at great prices! Hawker concept for food is great too.
Very accomodating stall owner - hokkien noodles n char kway teow is fantastic. Been patronising this stall since the 70's.
Great food! Beer is a little pricey
"Nice place to hang up with friends, expats meeting place in Katong"
Quick yummy Thai food plus great variety of beers
"Place is small with a few stalls.
Was there around 3pm. Both Thai and Kebah stall taking a break, not selling or taking order. (didn't know got such thing )
End up with the only choice Yong Huat stall. The noodles taste good though is a bit pricey for local common dish at $5.00"
Vfm place. Average $30 per person.  2 beers n decent food.  Good with colleagurs.  Not family joint really.  Sports on tele mostly.  In the corner. No smoking in the place. Can do on the pavement though
Nice range of beer
Delicious old school hokkien noodles in the day. Nice Thai food at night. Wish there was wine served on top of the beers.
Really good selection of beer with a few hawker stalls
Nice local eatery and bar in the heart of Katong. Good selection of beers and ciders.
"Food is not bad, especially the Thai food. Drinks are priced reasonably."
"Didn't like the place, good and service"
"First time to try their hokkien mee. Love it!

Hokkien mee is a dish in Malaysian and Singaporean cuisine that has its origins in the cuisine of China's Fujian (Hokkien) province. In its most common form, the dish consists of egg noodles and rice noodles stir-fried with egg, slices of pork, prawns and squid, and served and garnished with vegetables, small pieces of lard, sambal sauce and lime (for adding the lime juice to the dish)."
"This place is a surprise to me. The noodle from the Thai food was great. The meat was tender and wanton was well season & crispy.

We went on a weekend and it was super crowded. Waited quite abit to get a seat."
I only go there for the Hokkien Mee. Don't go during the weekends over crowded and you won't have the Wok Hei.
Nice place
Good place to drink alone or your closest friends. Great cheap food as well.
Nice bar with an open air side. Good beers and friendly service.
Great place and beers but you never know what food stalls are open for business.
"The stalls at this place change pretty regularly; it's only the Yong Huat char kway teow that remains constant. Currently, there is a burger place, Thai, and kebabs.

I tried the chilli cheese hot dog from the burger stall. At $7.70, I find it expensive for a hot dog, but I suppose it's what the market is willing to pay.

The taste was Ok, nothing special but I would recommend this place as the choices are quite different from what you can get elsewhere in the neighbourhood.

I also tried the 2 sliders for kids. They were ok, but again not particularly memorable."
"Had curry chicken rice, beef burger and mutton kebab set. All tasted nice, but a little pricey."
Great food!
"Great place to relax for coffee, fruit drinks, or beer."
"Great drink choices but Mediterranean food had underwhelming portions. Paid $6.50 for a ""kebab platter"" that had less meat than a chicken's leg. Quality did not live up to portion-price expectations too. Utterly disappointed."
Good craft beer selection.
"Go for the great Thai food and Yong Huat dishes (hokkien mee etc) but forget about the Kebabs & More stall (slow service, small portions, average kebabs). Beer selection is wide but happy hour specials are short (3-6pm)."
"Chao Xia Mian,Xia Mian Tang,Hao Chi"
Best place for beer
"Here to see the Star Wars premiere at 112 Katong and found a favourite from back near home. Ordered the Kebabs Plate that comes with Beef, Lamb and Chicken for $25. Great value and the meat was tasty. I washed it all down with a few of the draught beers. So tempting to cross the road for chocolate"
"Has a great selection of beers from around the world. The choices get updated from time to time. So it's possible to find something to like. So far, the staff are great. My favourite food stall is the fried mee sua. However, it closes early, around 19:00. So you would need to eat early, then drink. Otherwise, I love this place, to drink with my friends."
A bit crowded
Very nice ambiance with very good food! Fried kway Teow is what you definitely can't miss.
"Love the fried mee sua - really old
School style and with deep fried pork bits and excellent chilli.  The Baan Thai wonton mee is also good."
Incredible choice of beer
Always fantastic. N even have A& W rootbeer float. I basically enjoy the bad boy of them all. Char kuay teow
Interesting beer selections
Great mix of local food and beer! Great place to watch the world go by after a day of work.
Excellent kebab.
"Chilled out place and the food stalls offer quick, well priced dishes to go with a large selection of beers. What always is slow, for some reason, is getting change back from payment!!"
"Great choice of beers (Belgium especially), nice kebab place as well, friendly staff. Only issue can be the traffic surrounding the place"
There's one stall that I frequent and that's Yong Huat's fried noodles. It's a husband and wife team who have been frying all types of noodles for decades. My favourite is the fried mee suah which IMO is the best in SG. They also do a mean fried kway teow and hokkien mee. Quite a few foreigners drop by for the affordable beer. The only draw back is that there is no aircon so it can get quite warm especially in the afternoon.
"Friendly hawker with craftbeer and greek + burger stall.
Kinda crowded so wouldnt recommend if you come with a big group"
Good Burger
The Rudest and most Pretentious Experience for food from the Food Service Group
Nice place to come for quick meal during day time and a deep chat at night time.
Staff slow and rude. Payed cadh but no change given back.
Loving my Hokkien Mee and Kopi
"Becoming of a Katong landmark of the new era. If you're hanging around Katong, this corner is great stopover for an ice cold  beer  and just watch time passes by. Limited quality on food however its great place to meet friends before proceeding to the numerous restaurants in Katong.    for the drinks and only 1  for price"
Good concept! Hawker pub with good food and wide range of drinks. From alcoholic to non-alcoholic. Fresh juice are available too.
Good beer choices at reasonable price while serving good local hawker dishes (till 8pm)
Very good Char Kway Teow. Also other food choices and a decent selection of beers.
Cupparoma bacon beef burger is good
"A popular place along Joo Chiat road, always packed on weekend evenings with a mixed of locals and foreigners. Serve a good mix of beers and bar food in the evening, in the day there are good local food available. Overall the place have a good vibe and a good place to chill out. Premier League Football is screened on weekends."
Char Kway Teow was average but the lime juice was good value for money
The wanton chasyu noodles are excellent. Though the place can get rather warm on humid days.
Good sports bar with good happy hours
Great place to try out a wide variety of beer and food! Awesome location away from the city.
"Apple Pay wanted!
Nice place. If they would accept Apple Pay - I'd give 5 stars :)"
Pretty good concept.
Good collection of beers. Food collection has to be improved especially bar bites.
Nice place to hang out. The food served ain't too bad either. Worth a visit
"A coffee shop that turns into a watering hole in the evening. Has a fantastic choice of beer and liquor, and mocktails. Nice food to boot. Must try the noodles stall which operates during the day. Hungry, go there!"
Good place for beer lovers with a huge variety and some good deals on beers. The place is a hawker concept so they don't serve food and it has to be ordered from the fellow hawker outlets that are run along side them in the same place. Overall a good place to visit for a beer-e-licious visit!
"Coffee shops are evolving to hawker bar to beat the rising rent and labour cost. This place the heritage Char Kway Teow is juicy, the wide variety of beer is interesting."
"Standard beers on tap, liked the Indian food. Seems family place"
"Good selection of local, Thai, western and French.  Serves drinks too"
Good hokkien mee.. The stall has been ard for ages and has the wok fried taste
Great place for a quick meal and some drinks
"Old Meets New Age Hawker Concept

Call it an upscale hawker if you will, this corner foodhouse combines the traditional potpourri of a hawker with an bar environment.

Try:
Fried Hokkien Mee | Yong Huat [perfectly oily and savory with crunchy lard bits]

Follow us at IG: eatsmorefun"
Great place to chill and drink if you're in the east
"Come here for the char kway teow and fried hokkien mee.  The uncle and auntie duo formidably fry bee hoon, mee tai mak, and tang hoon in the same style too - oozing with delicious stock and chock full of fried pork lard!"
Pint for 10$ all day
"A coffeeshop by day and a hawker bar by night, enjoy up to 70 labels of beer at this unassuming joint frequented by locals."
"Want to watch the BPL? Then this is a great choice. There is an extensive beer menu and several food options.

The only downside is the lack of AC. Come on ye blues!"
Good bar with a wide range of beer and good food at a reasonable  price
Disappointing popiah. Skill of the guy wrapping the popiah was not good. Popiah skin broke and fell apart and he still tried to keep it together by compressing it. He still served both broken popiah and squeezed them in the takeaway box.
I feel the popiah is quite common. Just adding more crispy bits inside. Nothing worth to should about. No queue the day when I was there so I ordered to try.
"The lady looks like a bit Anmo very rude, I take away 1 popiah, she finished pack n throw the food to me and the plastic bag very sticky due to she wearing the gloves full of popiah sauce.
Pls...serve food to people don't throw ...pass to people nicely."
"There wasn't a $4 for 2 promo despite confirmation, but I still went ahead and bought it. The food was decent. Just take note when queuing not to let some self-entitled woman, or anyone, try to jump your queue just because your order is larger than theirs. This Kate Spade wallet-clutching auntie had the audacity to ask the staff to take her order first the moment I opened my mouth to place mine. This incident has marred my experience.

Everyone queues, everyone waits. I did too.
I'm not sure what makes her think she's above that. Maybe next time, skip the popiah and pick up some basic respect instead."
"I absolutely LOVE kueh pie tie and popiah so I was really excited to check out Michelin Plate Ann Chin Popiah's new outlet at Parkway Parade.

We ordered:
- Prawn popiah (spicy) 
- Prawn kueh pie tee (spicy) 
- Yam cake & chee cheong fun set 
- Biscoff waffles 

Everything was so yummy! Best afternoon snack ever!  Popiah had the crispies (which I love), sauces were on point for the kueh pie tee and yam cake, chee cheong fun texture was very different from the usual ones we have (loved that the skin was so thin), and the waffles were yummy too. Recommend!

: Ann Chin Popiah @ Parkway Parade Kopitiam"
"Handmade popiah, yam cake and chee cheong fun, classic tastes, made fresh every day 
Try their Kueh Pie Tee and yummy  chicken cutlet waffle too! Love it !"
"One of the best popiah spots in Singapore -- and Michelin-approved too!

Tried Ann Chin Popiah recently and I'm honestly impressed. Their handmade popiah is soft, packed full of juicy, flavorful fillings, and perfectly rolled.

You can really taste the freshness and care that goes into every bite. Highly recommend their signature popiah -- it's a must-try!
I also had the Kueh Pie Tee, and it was just as amazing -- crispy shells loaded with delicious fillings, super addictive.

Prices are affordable, portions are generous, and they have multiple outlets all over Singapore, so it's super convenient.

If you're a popiah lover or just looking for a good local snack, Ann Chin is definitely worth a visit. Will be back for more!"
"I honestly didn't expect their Popiah to be this good, no wonder it's Michelin-selected and always so popular! Their Popiah skin is handmade fresh every day, the fillings are super generous, and I'm obsessed with the crispy bits they add, they give each bite the perfect crunch.

They're currently running an opening promo: 2 Popiahs for just $4, now till the end of April

Besides their signature Popiah, they also serve local favourites like Kueh Pie Tee, Yam Cake, Chee Cheong Fun, and more."
"There's a crowd even during non-peak hours! After trying, it's evident why there's always a queue. I liked that the ingredients are fresh (they make their own popiah skin) and they're super generous (the kueh pie ti was overflowing)!"
"Ann Chin Popiah never disappoints! Their popiah is super fresh with thin, soft skin and flavourful filling - just the right balance. We also tried the yam cake, chee cheong fun, and kueh pie tee... all so good! The yam cake was fragrant and not too oily, chee cheong fun had that silky texture with tasty sauce, and the kueh pie tee was crispy and packed with flavour. Everything tasted homemade and comforting. Perfect for anyone craving local delights done right!"
"Tried the new Ann Chin Popiah outlet at Parkway Parade's new food court -- love the clean and comfy ambiance!

The prawn popiah was super fresh, juicy, and flavourful. Also had the prawn kueh pie tee -- so crispy and tasty! They're currently having a 2 popiah for $4 promo, which is such a steal.

I also tried their yam cake / chee cheong fun set and the chicken cutlet waffle -- both were satisfying and nicely done.

There's always a queue, but it moves quickly. Totally worth it for such fresh and yummy traditional bites. Will be back for sure!"
"Didn't expect much from a Popiah, but this brand's Popiah and Kueh Pie Tee is a 10/10 

Even at 4.30pm, there was a queue. Orders are freshly made on the spot.

Popiah skin, crispy bits, fillings are made fresh daily. Our Popiah skin didn't turn soggy even after awhile.

 I'm eating this again!!!

The food court is new and clean.

Lines? Yeah, they're forming. But the queue moves fast and DEFINITELY WORTH IT. Perfect spot for Michelin approved snacks at wallet friendly price!"
"I really love 'Mang Kwang' (stewed turnip) and the crunchy bits, which were deliciously paired well with the other ingredients such as hard-boiled egg, lettuce, bean sprouts and peanuts. The bite of Popiah was flavorful and it retained its moisture well. Each mouthful was bursting with flavours!  Most importantly, the crunchy texture made my experience even better.

The popiah retains its moisture rather well, bursting with flavours, yet not breaking the freshly made delicate skin"
"I am picky on food but this deserve 5 stars!! Tried their kebab rice. Great taste, huge portions and reasonable price. Recommend!"
Chicken quesadilla is yummy
"those who have had authentic Yemeni mandi would know that this is not mandi at all. more like briyani rice with chicken curry and lamb shank curry. was quite disappointed as there were many positive reviews. will not come again. maybe the other dishes would be nicer..? also quite pricey - for the chicken mandi and lamb shank mandi was $29 altogether.. no choice of quarter chicken, have to buy half chicken, which i think is too big a portion for one pax"
"I ordered through Grab, and the sauce and salad were spilled everywhere. The sauce got mixed with the rice, which wasn't cooked properly. The meat portion mostly consisted of skin and was very tough."
Simply the best!! 
"One of the best around and value for $$$

I have been patronizing this stall regularly for the past few years, but just realized that I have yet to review it! What a sacrilege to decently good food and service!

The kebabs, especially the chicken, are well grilled. Tender, juicy and tasty. Yums! Goes really well with fries, rice, salad or in the quesadillas, pide or burritos. My fav? Is by far the pide with extra chicken! Fresh, fragrant dough and filled with cheesy, juicy chicky goodness.

Service is always with a smile. And since Marsiling Mall is built with high ceiling and BA fans, place is well ventilated and with sufficient seats.

Heading for my pide again, shortly."
"Fantastic turkish food in woodlands!!! 

Had the chicken kebab with rice and the rice was super flavourful! the chicken was well cooked and well seasoned, on par or better than stuff d's chicken. chicken was tender and very delicious. they also quite generous with the portions and you confirm will be full after eating.

the red sauce used on the rice was flavourful also

friendly service and fast. no nonsense. friendly lads. good turkish food in woodlands
will be back to try other offerings like kebab, Kunafe etc.

RECOMMEND "
"Love their chicken kebab - it was well-marinated, tender and succulent. It complements well with their briyani rice, which is flavourful and well-cooked. The tomato-like sauce is a cherry on top for the rice as it enhances the burst of flavours. This stall has a high CP value too - this is almost restaurant-like standards for a price of only $8+. Would 10/10 be back again - definitely worth travelling down to Marsiling for it"
"Cold. Both the pita and lamb rice was not piping hot or warm -- it was just plain cold. Expected the food to be better than Stuffd or ""authentic"" but nah, give it a miss. A taste that is lacking coupled with a cold dish makes a miserable meal."
Generous portion wow! Quesadilla was wow too!
simply love the food and dessert
Superb service and delicious food! Highly recommended! Jazakumullah Khairan! 
"I had a good experience at Arabica Kebab in Marsiling Mall. The food was generally tasty, especially the beef, which was well-seasoned. The pita was fresh and paired nicely with the mayo, which added a good flavor. The fries, however, were a bit too soft for my liking--could have been better with a bit more crisp. Did not like chicken though. One thing I would suggest is adding garlic sauce to their menu; it would really elevate the flavors. Overall, a solid spot for a quick and satisfying meal."
Will be my favourite place to get my wrap.  Delicious.  Had the chicken wrap and kunafa.
"Jus happens to be at Marsiling Mall.  Prices at $9.50 , overall reasonable portions and tasty.  May have to Q"
"Updates on 26 Mar 2024 7pm
Ordered take out for chicken kebab salad, today's portion (both salad and chicken) was very miserable, almost like half eaten portion and price has increased to $8 from $7. But of course the chicken is still as tasty.

Few months ago 1st review below
This stall has been around for the longest time but it wasnt only up till recently I tried the chicken kebab wrap, quesadillas, chicken kebab salad and lamb MANDI, amazing briyani rice.

Been back to this stall at least once a week. Nice baked rice too with generous fillings! For the health conscious, just get the chicken salad with sauce on the side."
"Kebab chicken is chef kiss . Ate countless times, must try!"
The kebab rice is absolutely delicious! The serving size is already so huge at $8. It's totally worth it.  No wonder there's quite a queue during dinner time compared to other stalls. I would love to try other dishes next time.
Price increased. Lamb mandi is $17 and I think it's quite expensive. Food tastes average.
"The chicken pita was a 5/5. The pita was made fresh in the oven and was packed full of their signature chicken and the usual vegetables (I believe it's tomatoes & cabbage). The sauces pair well too.

I'm glad that I ordered the pita rather than the usual kebab. For future reference, the chicken pita costs $7.

Would definitely come here again whenever the cravings hit."
Worth the price!! Portions are very large and the food is tasty
"Order a Quesadilla Mix.
Portion is big enough to fill my stomach"
"Mashallah the food very nice, always when i come to woodland i need to eat Kebeb with rice
Fast service less then 5 min i get my order. People very friendly"
"Disappointed the service, waited for more than 15 min. Nothing was cooked till being inform need to wait another 5 min... the wait spoil the mood having food."
"Arabica Kebab is located in Marsiling Mall Hawker Centre, stall #01-38.

Price: $8.00 (Mixed Burrito)

The ingredients of the mixed burrito includes minced beef, chicken, tomatoes, rice, raw onions, a spicy sauce and a tangy yoghurt sauce.

The mixed burrito was packed to the brim with chicken and beef and I was really pleasantly surprised they gave so much. The burrito is then slightly grilled before being served.

Service was very fast and I didn't have to wait long for my mixed burrito as it was assembled, placed onto the grill for a quick sear before arriving piping hot in my hands.

Really delicious and filling and not something you find very often at hawker centre so if you are craving a good burrito and in the area do check out this stall!"
The food is amazing so good flavours and portion is holy major! Would recommend for anyone trying out in the north searching for Turkish cuisine
Rice was below par. Pide was good.
"Today is my 2nd time purchase of chicken Quesadilla from this stall and it's a bit disappointing..:( I've requested with cheese earlier upon ordering. But after I collected my order, when I reached home to check, there's no cheese inside & lack of sauce in it. Portion is good but the first time when i bought chicken Quesadilla, portion is really a lot & it's filled with sauce & cheese plus lots of chicken. Much more filling, that's why I love it..

Hope the next time when I purchase they will not forget the sauce & cheese."
It's Kebab taste awesome.
Ordered the Kofta Mutton. Very juicy and tender. Even better than well know restaurants. They might be located in a coffee shop but the food is great.
"This is an amazing kebab place. Everything is delicious and real deal. They just opened Arabica Grill just behind this outlet and it's equally amazing. If you are in mood of good Arabic food, no better place in Woodlands than this."
KEBAB CHICKEN RICE WAS SO GOOD
"Hidden gem here in Woodlands. Great tasting middle eastern food at less than half the price of those restaurants at Arab street. Everything was flavourful, juicy, and with just the right texture. We had the Lamb Mandi, Chicken Quesadillas, and Kunafe - all were amazing. Portion sizes were HUGE too. Highly recommended."
Ordered quesadilla. It's just another kebab made into half moon shape. Too salty to our liking.
"Ordered via grab food and its so goood. My lamb mandi was still warm when it arrived.  The lamb shank was super tender and juicyyyy!!! First time to try knafeh and its was so yummy too, crispy outside but soft cheese inside  Will try the quesadillas next time as I've been reading a lot of positive reviews on it. "
Ridiculously huge serving size with great flavor. Recommended for big eaters.
Very friendly and delicious food :)
"Planned to buy quesadilla at this stall and had requested for no vege, but was told by the staff that it is ""best with vege as it's a whole experience"". I am like huh???

If you want to do business, give what the customers asked for. Needless to say, I cancelled my order.

Very unfortunate because I've heard a lot of good things about the food. But declining my 'no vege' request is a BIG NOPE for me."
"Ate the mixed kebab and i must say that it is the best kebab i have ever eaten in my life. Had this quite a while back (~3 months ago), and i think about eating this every now and then! The meats are so juicy and tender, moisture is locked into the meats unlike some other kebabs sold by other stalls that have dry, stringy meat. Seasoning is so good as well. Will definitely come back here again to try their other dishes"
"Amazing beef Quesadilla stuffed generously with juicy tasty and tender beef. 5 well balanced with the onions and tomatoes and cheese.
The chicken kebab is very good as well and chock-full with freshly carved chicken and vegetables.
Friendly stall owner with a great smile and service too!"
"Impressed with the Chicken Mandi: The basmati rice was skillfully cooked with great texture and bite, and dressed in a vinaigrette that added a refreshing taste along a hint of heat.
The star of the dish was the half-chicken - lightly spiced on the skin and slow-roasted(?) to juicy perfection. The breast was surprisingly moist, but the flesh on the thigh and wing slid cleanly off their bones with a drag of my fork!
Also served with a side of salad.
Overall, the dish really comes together nicely and wasn't overly seasoned nor greasy at all. Really well executed. An enormous portion for but the price of $10. Will be returning for more!
Stuff'd / pasar malam Middle Eastern food could not hold a candle to this."
"We had the mix (beef and chicken) kebab rice and mix pide, both are excellent! Portions given are generous too. Hidden gem in Marsiling mall."
"Large portion, good value, excellent taste."
"Delicious food with very reasonable price, great portion per serving, awesome menus for selection, will come back for more Turkish or Middle East kind of cuisines,. Friendly Chefs"
Got a quesadilla. Very tasty. Prices are higher comparative to normal hawker food. But it is worth it compared to restaurants :) nice food can eat
Friendly staff and good food.
"Freshly made Pita & quesadilla, Dble thumbs up!!"
The best and cheap arabic food!
"The best Mandy lamb and chicken
Kebab very nice"
Paid $9.60 for a grilled teriyaki chicken burger (single layer). The bun was soft and tasty. The chicken patty was tender and juicy. The fries tasted ok but slightly hard. Service was friendly and efficient.
Good service. My mistake for grabbing the wrong order. Reached home then realise. Went back to return the order. Cashier allow me to keep the extra food. I feel bad for the grab delivery guy whom I accidentally took his food 
The burgers are really delicious..
the cheese fries $5+ for a big portion is so worth is and its best cheese fries ive ever had
Consistent providing good burgers without comprising quality
The burger here is the best.
"Service was fast. 4 items ready in 15 mins. Had Aglio chic chop , black pepper chic chop, Ashes cheese burger and Mexican pull beef (taste like rendang beef) burger. All in good portion and taste good. Located in an aircon coffee shop settings. Up the escalator turn left."
"Located at level 2 of  coffeeshop at wlands north plaza. Note there is 2 coffeeshop side by side, don't go to the wrong one.

Burger isn't huge, plenty of fries though.. hence hood enough to make u full.

Patty and cheese is tasty! Overall worth a try.

Car park and washroom available on site."
Ordered truffle fries..so disappointing...should have just ordered French fries..no difference
"This is by far my worst dining experience at Ashesburnnint. The patty was so small when I purchased this meal on 8/12/2024.What on earth is this bullshet.Does not suit the price range at all. The sauce was overly salty could barely get a taste of the beef inside.Food quality is getting worse and worse. Used to be very decent with good quality beef patties. For now, it's just so overpriced. Can get similar, if not better meal with drinks at other burger joints. I hope it'll get improved soon. Please put quality before profit.The price point at a hawker centre is horrendous. Esp for a halal stall(iykyk). Quality has dropped significantly from the last time I visited. How bad is inflation hurting them? Or perhaps they were just greedy for more profit? If u r looking for halal burger/western stalls in the vicinity pls visit somewhere else e.g. causeway point"
The service was superb and he was friendly !! Definitely coming back because the the service and food was amazing.
"I bought the double patty truffle burger. The portion of fries was very generous and the burger tasted great. It was a bit expensive (~$12) but it was a very filling meal so I'd say it was well worth it!

A friend got the truffle fries and the truffle flavor was very prominent and pleasant, so I'd recommend that as well."
Always good and even delivery standard was good. Bun still crispy and fries are amazing
"Inflation is real. The price of the single patty Ashes Cheeseburger has slowly crept up to $8.40. The variant with bacon in it is now $9.40. No drinks are included at this price point, just a burger and fries. Then again, rising rental cost might be the root of this issue.

Burgers were decent. The buns were, well, black. They did not taste any different from non-black(?) buns.

Beef patties were amazing and fresh. My only gripe is that the patty was really thin. Perhaps it's due to the fact that it's a ""smash burger""? Or perhaps it's just shrinkflation. Who knows!

Fries were served hot which is always a plus point. Very lightly seasoned so ketchup is recommended.

Oh yes. One final plus point here is that the food court is air conditioned.

Overall: 3.5/5."
"Tried their Signature beef burger. Bun was soft, patty was juicy but not as seasoned as I like one other problem is the burger got some bits of stuff that's tough to bite thru I'm not a chef so idk what those are.
Fries are nice and crispy but I feel like it's not worth to add 2.5 on for just cheese sauce. Like 1.5 is reasonable but not 2.5. but to be fair they give a lot of cheese sauce."
"The staff here is incredibly friendly, and the food is a real treat. You've got to try the smash burger with their amazing sauce combo and the tasty aglio olio. Trust me, it's a must-try experience that I highly recommend!

2nd time here. Can nvr go wrong with them"
The counter guy service very good. Kan simple. Ada bahasa. Cekap. Senyum. Naik kan dia gaji boss.
Great burger!
I often order the Mac n cheese and black pepper chicken chop. The fries that comes with the chicken chop are nice. Their service is nice too .They have helped me out once out of their kindness and I appreciate it.
"The place is near to my hangout spot.When i went there for the first time, I tried one of the burgers n macs. So when I went to get a drink, the beeping device beeped. So I went check to see my burger. I thought it was the wrong burger, but turned out I ordered the same burger. The service was fast!!! 3-4 mins like that, when I tried eating the burger, it was really delicious ."
"When I arrived at the coffee shop, the place was not overly crowded. There was no queue at the store, so the ordering was a swift process. From the point of ordering to the food is ready, I didn't wait too long. Presentation wise, what makes the chicken Chop look different from other stores, I've never seen anyone season their sauce with herb, and the sauce taste great. Overall, I enjoyed all parts of the meal, except for the coleslaw. It's a decent plate of chicken Chop in the area."
"Good value for money burger, patty had good moisture and a good bite, fries are decent too!"
"Jie Qian Hen Gui,You Bu Hao Chi"
"Hidden gem in Woodlands. Broadway Coffeeshop at one corner of 883.

Price is OK.

The black buns are the star of the meal. Soft and tender crumbs. Patties are tasty and juicy but under seasoned to me. But then the sauce is too salty for me.

Fries are thick and short, looks damn good but they are very dry.

limited tables even on weekends.

Paylah available.  aircon is cool."
Burger was 
"My kid love them the most and can take them everyday.
Even the staff had know what I will be ordering before I told him.
Friendly and great...."
"Ordered single patty truffleshroom burger. Bread is soft, patty juicy and every mouth is filled with truffle fragrant. Would definitely come back again."
"The burgers here are decent. The truffle mushroom burger has a good truffle aroma and taste that is just nice and not overpowering. The Mexican pulled pork burger is on the sweet side and so it is not really to my liking. My favourite is the basic beef cheeseburger. The mac and cheese is ok - not too cheesey, which is good. The portion of french fries that come with each order is quite generous."
Food was very good for the price! I keep coming back for their burgers.
I've tried most of the items in their menu. Prices were affordable. The only thing i didn't really enjoy was the Alio Olio. It tasted a little basic but their Burgers thoughhhhh were very delicious that is why i kept returning to try other burgers. Great job!
Food Qty is good.
"genuinely didn't expect the fries to be this good. we visited on a saturday evening. wasn't busy, we were served within 10 minutes. ordered the truffle shroom and pulled beef. upgraded one fries to holy chick. fries were super hot, super freshly fried, so so good. enjoyed the truffle shroom, it has mushrooms and mashed potato. pulled beef was a tad sweet. overall good, will be back for more"
Abit expensive
"Ive been ordering their loaded fries for quite some time. It used to be filled with alot of fries and doused in tasty cheese and filled with alot of meat. Slowly they reduced their meat while upping the price which I could understand since cost goes up. However, while ordering through grab, the loaded fries barely had any fries, barely had any meat, barely had any cheese. Quite disappointing for $8. The Mac and cheese should be cheesy but it's only lightly coated with cheese barely cantaste it and the chicken that came along with it was so small. I don't know whether the cook different, I used to remember it to be value for money and tasting great. Now it's just typical overpriced western kopitiam food."
"Burgers are nicee. Portions are good. For the cheeseburger, would be better with a slice of pickle "
No complaint on the food but add a little smile and a thank you would create a better overall experience.
"super affordable neighbourhood gourmet burgers!!! great staff & customer service :) taste wise, i tried the bacon cheeseburger & beef brisket burger: both are rich in flavours and has an ""expensive"" taste to it. although the burger buns texture should be a little hard (?) as i find it a little bit soft. total spent less than $20 for 2 meals and both portions are quite filling! super worth it & would love to taste the chicken burgers next! "
Bought the fried chicken burger and teriyaki chicken burger. Both the burgers were ok in my opinion. Portion size is decent. Would prefer if they provide more options for sauces which will make the burgers taste better. Otherwise everything else is fine.
"One of the best Western food . Fries are nice, crispy on the outside, soft inside."
This outlet serves food as tasty as the rest.
"Location/Ambience: at a hawker center at L2 (Admiralty area)

Price: fair, it's actually cheap!

Quality: very good and generous portions

Remarks:
When you look at the menu, you think that you can finish that lamb chop plate or grilled chicken, but when it was served to you - it looks like it's for two
I come here with my 2 colleagues to eat lunch. The fries servings are also big and they cook upon ordering.
Bun is soft. I will buy again, maybe for delivery

Things to try:
Mac and Cheese
Brisket Burger
Roti John Burger
Overload Fries"
"So happy to find there is a new burger place in the neighborhood. The best seller short rib brisket burger is a blast. The filling of brisket/short rib are juicy and portion very generous. But the fries is shoestring not thick cutter fries. For the fried shroom burger is also very interesting, the enoki mushroom is fried to golden crispy and crunchy, the patty is moist from the inside and level up by dizzier of truffle oil. Nice. Overall waiting time is short as came early to takeaway, plus their service also fast. Next time can try their Mac n Cheese. They charge the takeaway box for $0.40 each."
"We got a Classic Burger and Shroom Burger. Classic was average but a refreshing take from the usual fast food chains. Shroom Burger was interesting and the truffle sauce was really nice. Their fries are quite thin compared to what was displayed on the menu, but it was still acceptable. Price was also reasonable!
Will not order frequently but curious to try their other selections..."
"Horrifying chicken chop with tomato cream pasta .. the chicken is so dry that I couldn't even chew to swallow, not to mention the pasta taste horrible as well .. despite the good review, the food is actually quite bad .. highly not recommended, and their take away packaging is cost saving but useless"
"Buy this for my neighbour, smell good taste good..we order burger sapi and mushroom"
"Excellent food, large portion, polite staff, fast service! Recommended for all!"
"Paid $9.40 for takeaway. Burger is not bad. I ordered the fried mushroom beef burger. They recently changed their menu, I prefer the old truffle burger but it wasn't on their menu anymore sad. Fries is thick and crispy. Meal does not comes with drinks"
I got their signature cheese burger for $7.80( I think) and it was ok. Nothing really special except for black buns and fries were quite tasty. I think it's filling but not in a sense where I was satisfied with the meal. I heard the shroom burger is pretty good so I'll try that the next time I'm there.
"This picture is the empty box from which a double cheeseburger used to be. The fries were awesome. My stomach is stretching. My regret was to have added chili sauce on the fries. Ruined it in my own hands. Wife had cheesy steak john. Broke her low carb week streak. Her respond was worth the calories. Single honey chicken burger for mom. She's usually picky but not today. Please stay awesome forever. Northerners, if you need a burger fix. Don't waste your time on McD or BK. Tbh. Comparing AB to them is an insult."
Amazing amazing food. Must try!
nice and affordable!
Good burgers.
"Anyone who thinks Halal western food is bland, boring and unappetising should give the items on this stall's menu a try! They're somewhat more expensive than your average coffee shop western fare, but for a slightly higher price you get restaurant-grade quality burgers that makes it well worth every dollar spent!"
Classic cheeseburger & Smoky pulled beef burger. Thumbs up.
Love their grilled chicken chop
Friendly staff and good food!!
Delicious halal burgers and western food at an affordable price!
"Bought 4 chicken wings on 2 Feb night.
Both myself and husband have food poisoning 
Wonder what's wrong with the food"
"My gf ordered the yam ice blended w pearls. She drank it halfway and she pulled out a literal squid/octopus tentacle FROM HER MOUTH. It was inside the drink. Dk how it went in. Very gross experience.
Its a small one not even sure if its a damned octopus or leech or earthworm. Dont go there please, unless u are a food hygiene inspector"
Have gone there at least thrice - and most recent in the morning to ask for mee rebus. They still don't have it - citing 'machine spoilt'. And it's 10 am on a Sunday morning. Don't think his stall will last a long time.
"I visited the thai stall twice. First time i patronised the stall i ordered the thai basil rice for 4.80 the serving size was a lot. Not too salty and was fragant.
I ordered the tomyum fried rice for the second time and there was a lot of herbs included. One of the best tom yum fried rice ever tried before"
"Patronised the Thai food, Takeaway only, the stallholders are not Thai, though I met a Thai lady the last time.

Service was rather haphazard, called me thrice using buzzer and another 2 times waving at me through counter when food was not ready. I had to waste my time waiting, then no point giving buzzer.

My food was all cooked in batches, they could have easily packed them in 5-10 minutes but nope cause their kitchen operations were so messy, it took them 25 minutes for my takeaway.

Another lady in front of me waited almost 30 minutes for a garlic prawn with creamy omelette.

Taste wise basil pork was okay. Thai milk tea excellent 
Can give thick tomyum a miss, quite oily and barely any ingredients (can refer to picture). My family tried and didn't like it too."
"Very disappointed with the $2 nasi set. Qty is miserable . Whole egg is NOT fresh and ikan bill too tiny.   Chilli, bird egg and chilli fish cake are nice though. Too much chilli in the $2 set too. Chicken wing so so. Will not buy from there again.  Total spent $12.80 for 3pax. Rather buy from normal market stall nasi lemak."
nice pisang goreng and you tiao service also good
"Pleasantly surprised by these yummy curry puffs with thin skin! My personal preference is the sardine flavour. Kinda expensive at $1.40 each, but plentiful filling and yummy taste makes it worthwhile! Grab some on your way to the East Coasf Park picnic, like I did today!"
"Recommended little stall with friendly staff. Most of the items are $2 for 3 pieces. They have pisang goreng, putu piring, cempedak, lupis, etc. I especially like the pisang goreng. They are using pisang gepuk, different than the chinese version."
"Was just trying out...
Didn't expect their banana ball to be so tasty!! Can taste chunk of banana..

Not the usual dark colour, you might seen else where..
This one is light brown, shows two possibilities, they don't over use the oil until it become unhealthily black! Plus they take care not to overcook it till the banana ball is unhealthily black..

Will definitely return...!"
Excellent selection of snacks and of good consistent quality.
"So I came across this shop which sells Kueh and I know the shop is called Aiziza PUTU PIRING but I just did not have any cravings for PUTU PIRING. So I saw one of my favourite which is pulut Serending. Didn't even know the name so I asked the guy for the name of dish.

So basically pulut Serending is a glutinous rice shaped into a ball and topped with a spicy and sweet coconut grating mixture.

The outside of the rice was dry and hard maybe because they left it outside for a long time? The coconut topping was nice though, spicy and slightly sweet.

Overall it was passable."
"Pales in comparison to Haig Road's putu piring. Texture is very powdery and soft, and the desiccated coconut bits were missing the fragrance of the coconut necessary to complement the dish."
"The drinks stall lady, the younger, chubby one with short hair is always VERY rude. I'm a chill guy, and I'd usually tell myself that the other party may have had a bad day, but this girl has consistantly been rude and arrogant on multiple occasions. I think she need to make a career switch from being any kind of CSO and join the Mandai Zoo cos she is good at treating people like animals. Drinks shop towkay, please please do your business a favour and reassign her to a non-CSO role or reccomend her to Mandai Zoo 

On the flip side, the Tenderbest auntie is super duper nice and the only reason I come here is to support her. Sad that I cant write a seperate 5 star review for tenderbest store and CSOs"
"Don't be trick by the price stated on the mix rice stall which says $3.90 for 2 vege and 1 meat. I was charge $5.40.

I ask why and the stall lady says the meat is $3."
"I ordered think coffee that cost me $1.50.
However, what I'm getting from this coffee shop is just a diluted coffee ( refer to my photo )
I'm pretty sure they are recycling the coffee. Power multiple times.
Very dishonest seller."
the food sold at the hawker stores there are very good but way too many pigeons flying around
"Been staying around the area for quite some time and this is one of my go to places for food, especially when I'm craving for cai fan. It opens 24/7 and they are reasonably priced."
drink auntie was very rude one le. I get scolded got nothing. She was so kind to  chinese customers but to malay customers she talk to us like we did something wrong mind you we just wanted drinks hope they can change the drink stall auntie
"It's the 26/09/2023 @ around 0442am at the coffee house at 888 woodlands
As I'm a grab food delivery rider I was so thirsty that I had stopped by 888 to use the wash room get a refreshment & wait out for orders to come in so as I headed towards Bai send food court thinking on what to get but only having a single dollar with me.
So Here I am walking up to the drink stall asking the casher nicely for a packet of plain water with ice which I had placed my dollar nicely on to the counter.
Upon me doing so the cashier herself had actually given me a look that she wasn't happy & disgust & upon the very dollar I placed on the counter but I just didn't know what mistake I had said or done to have made her unhappy or was it that I didn't speak to her in Mandarin & that was why she acted that way but even than I waited for my drink but then she just carried on taking her time doing her duties.
When she was done with her duty she shifted herself towards the casher to take payment but upon returning my change her reaction upon returning it was really unpleasant. Just by pushing the change towards me & had even handed me my very drink holding the plastic bag string with only 2 finger's without a straw.

I really feel so diapointed being treated like some kind of trash out in public.

I do understand that everyone get tired angry sad upset or whatsoever cause I too go through those thing's but i do not leash it out on other's just because I'm in a bad mood.

I really am lost for words."
The laksa is above average
There are better food nearby
"I stopped by here to weather out a passing rain,  and discovered that the Pork Kidney Noodles are pretty good! The noodles are well cooked (these tend to take longer to soften,  so if they skimp out on cooking time,  noodles end up hard...). Kidney slices are given in generous portions and the soup is nice and fragrant! Definitely better than Seng Kee ....."
Satay not freshly bbq. It's cold.
"Kueh Chap for 2 at $8 nett. Reasonably priced but come 01 May, price increase of 50 cents for 1 pax portion."
Still upgrading. Limited sitting area. Foods thete are ok.
"The food here is cheap and nice. There's mixed rice stall, chicken and duck rice stall, Chinese noodle, herbal soup, zichar, western, malay cuisine, economical bee hoon, claypot stall. Definitely recommend to try the herbal soup stall! Free refill of soup available."
"Good selection of food and the Ayam Penyet here is pretty good. The chicken meat was not too dry and yet it's skin was crispy. The rice was also ""chicken rice"" type and the chilli that accompanied it is just right and not too hot for me. Would come back again for the Ayam Penyet."
"The food is excellent. It's so good. The chicken is soft and tender.
The sauce is aromatic. Comes with a small bowl of soup. 

I ordered Ayam panggang $8.50 with Fair price app, you'll get discount.
Highly recommend this stall."
"Used to be a loyal customer -- now disappointed

I've always enjoyed patronising Indonesian BBQ before the renovation of Parkway Parade's Food Republic. Back then, everything was great. However, after the renovation and rebranding to Kopitiam, things have gone downhill.

Firstly, the price has increased, and the portions have shrunk. They used to include a generous side of shredded cabbage and other vegetables. Now, it's just one piece of lettuce, one slice of tomato, and two pieces of tofu. I honestly came for the cabbage--it was part of what made the meal special. This change is really disappointing.

To make things worse, I had a bad experience with a rude staff member. I ordered ""Number 1 (Ayam Bakar), dabao (takeaway), add veggie"" and paid via the FairPrice app. However, the app reflected ""Number 6 (Ayam Penyet)"" instead. The staff started plating a dine-in order, which confused me at first. When I realised, I clarified that I had ordered Number 1 and that it was for takeaway.

Instead of assisting politely, the staff became visibly annoyed, raising her voice and blaming me, saying I didn't inform her earlier. I told her I did say it. She responded sarcastically: ""Oh, you got say ah? Then I hear wrongly lor."" Then she moved the food to the takeaway box with attitude, and even threw the plate onto the counter after. No apology, no thank you--just plain hostility.

Is this the standard of service being trained here? This encounter really ruined my day.

I won't be returning anytime soon."
"2.5/5, on the surface the nasi panggang looks very decent. but for 8.50, the meat inside was slightly tough and hard to chew. soup was lukewarm too.

Staff was rigid, maybe not her fault but asked to swap the tempeh+tofu for some cabbage and was denied, need to topup additional 1.50 for small portion of veg.

Used to frequent this stall before the reno of the new kopitiam in parkway. Post-reno i would say to give this stall a miss."
"Taste of the soup is getting BAD to WORST!
Not as good as before. Didn't taste any of their origin spices at all.

Owner pls look in to this."
"????order food pandaLai,Ban He Tang San Pian Cai Gen Si Pian Niu Rou???Zhu Ni Sheng Yi Xing Long"
"Beef mala noodle is a must try,generous helping of beef and chilli pack a punch"
Love to eat this shops!  went few times but it close.. does anyone knows did they close down for good or they still there?
"One of my go to place if I wanted to have a good bowl of soup and add-on noodles if I am hungry.

The last round I went, I ordered a bowl of mutton ribs soup with You Mian (a type of thin noodle). Love the thick soup base as well as the generous portion of mutton ribs with meat. The mutton meat was really tender and full of flavor. I think it is better to dine in for this stall. I feel that takeout or delivery does take the flavor off."
"A few mins ago, me & other 2 friends ordered from this place via grab. I ordered beef tendon noodle set for take away order and all I receive is a half full of take away plastic bowl and 5 literally slices of meat? Seriously? If this how you guys run your business by cheating customers of their meal and price? If this is the way you run it, close down la. & its $10.03 for my meal. I expected better but this a such a disappointment, I'm angered and triggered by this. I need an answer from your place and I demand one. I paid 10.03$ for this?! Seriously?! You guys are ridiculous. I also have a video of what it looks like as a whole. If there's zero star, I'll be happy to rate it."
My go to beef noodles. Love the broth so much I always order another bowl of soup. Store keeper is also friendly and I enjoy having this at least 2 times a month.
Today's soup was a tad too salty somehow. Ordered menu no. 2B and had 2 bowls. 1 was for me 1 for my mum. Both tasted salty. I'm not sure if the cook taste the food before selling. But it could be a sign of standards dropping. Used to superb. Cant say the same now tho.
The quality of the food is slowly going south.. its being managed and operated by the same individual from start to this day. I wonder why that is...
Yassin Wok Hei Muslim Stall with Beef King by Yassin Kampung
"Ordered through Grabfood , received delivery but unfortunately no cili given ( despite my request) and only 4 to 5 small cubes of meat  for our beef kway teow soup ... no vegetable at all ...   standard definitely dropped ...   unfortunately !!!  Don't think will order again."
"Order beef ball and beef soup, the beefball and the beef taste good but the soup taste was bellow expectation. Overall it's an ok experience."
"Just average, nothing to wow about"
I order grab food from here and this is what i get . How even a worm inside the rice and i have to throw away .
Had both the soup and dried version of beef noodles.The beef and tendon is on the tough and chewy side.The chilli sauce is just like chicken rice I prefer the other sauce that is sour and spicy.The beef soup is rich but dk why taste abit like kambing
"Order $9.50 beef, tendon and tripe which is stomach of cow with thick bee hoon.

Pros
Beef was thick but brittle. Is a tough cut but it was cooked to the extent that they just break apart. Reasonably flavorful.

Tendon is gluey, soaking up the gravity gives it it's taste.

Sauce. Optional sauce both are great but not needed imo. Chili is definitely spicy.

Soup. Sweet gaming and I think full of msg. Is nice lah but makes u thirsty.

Meh
Tripe. While expected to be chewy, the cut is too thick causing it to be rubbery. Taste is still go but could have been better if slice is slimmer."
Mala beef noodle 5 stars for u!Nvr scrimp on ingredients and super flavourful.Recommended
"Ordered the #7 (dry)

Overall, delicious - Now this is just my opinion, I wish the soup that came on the side was a little more flavourful

With that being said, I'll definitely come back here when I want Beef noodles and it's definitely a place I'd recommend"
"I ordered the beef, tendon with thick bee hoon soup. The noodles was smooth, beef very tender and the soup was delicious, not too saltish. See my photo, you will know what I mean."
"Alamak today closed, I been waiting since 9am, shop not open yet, unfortunately"
Paid $10 for noodle with mutton rib to takeaway. All fats... no vegetable /meat or rib bones.
Too pricey for the amount of meat given. There were only a few small bites and most of it were fats.
"love the mala beef noodles here especially with the thick beehoon pairing! Mala soup base has a great kick and is savoury. Noodles are affordable (less than $6) and great portion too! Generous portion and tasty, would recommend if you are looking for food in the area"
"Bought 2 types. Mala and the normal beef noodle. Juicy beef soup, just melts in your mouth. Perfect for rainy weather. Preferred the Beef Noodle soup than the Mala (cause I'm not really a fan of Mala)"
"A go to place after friday prayers when it was still in old woodlands. No change on their keema and chapati. If you feel like eating azmi restaurant chapati and staying in the north, feel free to come down and try theirs!"
The best Bryani !!!!!!
Good chapatti and briyani at affordable prices. My family has been going to this stall since the time when they were at the old Woodlands centre. The chicken meat is so tender. Tastes better when the rest and dish is hot. Friendly uncle who runs the stall too.
"The best briyani i ever ate after my mum's briyani. I usually call him to make an order before heading to the shop. Politely packed. Ever once I called at 5am, to order chapati set. Thanks uncle. By now you should know who wrote this. Take care.."
Chappathi here is without oil and healthier must try everyone.
Perhaps the only place in the north to get your dose of authentic satay! 
Visited this place multiple times. One of the best chapati and kheema in the north! Don't need to travel down to CENTRAL just to have Azmi (Norris Rd) cause this place have awesome chapati as well.
best chapati ive tasted! very nice seller too
Some how the mutton biryani is blant...I expected more
"Tried more than 7 and this is by far the best mutton briyani in woodlands.
Rice is well cooked and fragrant, mutton so falls off the bone tender, curry just the right consistency and spiciness."
Bhai's rice has singular grains that is both fragrant and well spiced. The keema w/ chapati is second only to Norris road's. Full piece of chicken thigh and drumstick for a flat fee. This guy is the Briyani king  of woodlands.
"I frequent this stall for the exceptional chapati, briyani, dhaal & kheema. Sometimes all at once.
The dhaal portion size is rather large for a dollar at this time of writing, and Uncle don't do shortcuts here."
This place has the best chappatti I ever eaten. They originated from old woodlands interchange which has been demolished. Looked for them for years and found him at Marsiling Mall. You should try this chappatti and kheema before you die. I never give 5 star rating unless as nobody's perfect. The chappatti bread is also soft and has the powdery floor which makes its taste unique. Not oily and healthy. Kheema is quite oily but you don't eat it everyday!! Lol.
Bought mutton briyani and it was very bad. Mutton was full of bone and rubbery and i was not even able to tear apart using utensils. I was charged $6 for this and it was a very big disappointment. Other stalls in woodlands have better briyani standards.
"the quantity here is much much less than what i get at the same joint at Suntec. i had beef noodle soup, and was asked if i wanted to upgrade with additional beef balls for $3 extra. i agreed, and when it was served to me, i found out that for $3 i only got TWO extra beef balls. so finally for $14.90, i got 2 beef balls and 4 or 5 pieces of beef and some noodle soup. this place is not worth visiting even if it is the last available place to eat. anyone who gave this place 2 stars and above ( after the renovation ) need to get their head checked."
The standard has dropped significantly yet the price went up.  Beef is not good strips and shredded.  Best go jalan besar for the real deal.
The beef is very chewy and the soup has no taste. I will never eat here again.
"This used to be very good. But after the reno, the quality has dropped. Beef slices are fewer and not tender anymore -- the beef is tough!"
"I'm a regular customer for Blanco beef noodles in Parkway Parade food court at the basement.

The taste of the beef noodles is great and everything is well balanced and not overpowering. Every part of the beef (sliced beef, tendon & etc) requires different cooking time to achieve great texture while maintaining its chew and softness. Well, I'd say Blanco did everything right.

The cincalok and the chilli at the side elevates the entire dish which I appreciate.

Although sometimes I would whine about the price being expensive. A small bowl would cost me $12+, and big one cost $18+ (if I remember correctly), but the quality of Blanco beef noodles remained consistent on every visit I made. If I were a Michelin inspector, I would definitely give them a recognition, at least they deserve to be in a bib gourmand list."
Friendly cashier. Soup is light which is what I like. Beef ball is a salty. Decent food.
"Are U Hungry ?

My favourite  Beef Noodles (dry)

I ordered the large bowl of Beef Noodles - thicker vermicelli (dry) w/ thinly sliced of Beef meat  @ $12.90.

It was great  dining as the powerful chillies  get into the kick  + it's piping hot soupy brewed got me sweating . Replenishing the soup + DIY extra chillies  ...

This stall the portion of the noodle is ridiculously small as compared to others . They should really look into it. It Is like 30% less other stalls.
"A famous chain! The noodle texture was good, like chewy thick beehoon. Ingredient portion was generous. Gave only 3* as I felt the taste was quite light, both for the soup and sauce (I tried dry mala beef noodles btw)"
"Dropped by on a Sunday for early dinner. Peaceful corner of Food Republic.
Enjoyed the chewy beef ball dry noodle. Sliced beef noodle was okay too. $9.90 for small size, added veg for $3.
Prices are going up these days.... beef noodles used to be half this price. But at least we can still find food like this around!"
Sauce too diluted. Noodles not available.
"On rainy days when you're craving for a comforting soupy broth, this is the place to go! The smell of the broth is simply mouthwatering as you approach the stall. Beef slices however seem to be on a stingier side but the soup broth makes up for the loss."
"If you have eaten other outlet's blanco court beef noodles, this outlet's food is super bland and not up to standard."
Good that they put the peanut powder in front for our own helping. Good food and nice environment. Friendly staff like Mr Law advising me how to add salted vegetables with my noodles. Will definitely be coming round :-)
"Had a bowl of dry beef noodle, was disappointed with the gravy, taste  differently, sweeter now,  as if sugar was added to the gravy."
"Have dined here quite a few times over the years. Found that the quality had gradually improved. Even the service was excellent this time.

Had their mixed dry version. Beef slice was ok, beef ball was better than expected, beef honeycomb was ok and the tendon came in big slices."
Sliced beef and beef ball dried version noodles is yummilious.Should have taobao  two instead of one today.....
Tried the soup version and the dried version of beef shank which I personally prefer the soup version.

"Authentic beef Bee Hoon
Ordered the classical with beef, beef ball and  stomach of 11 + dollars
Located in the corner of B1 food court next to Joyluck, a highly populated location in parkway parade
All the meat are tender , nicely cooked
Gravy is thick with an usual traditional taste
The soup is clear with rich flavor
Even the chili is very nice"
"Happy with this meal (small noodle, dry sauce. Add $2 beef slices).

Generous with the soup, pickled veg and coriander. I'm happy with the chilli too. Satisfying meal."
"Good beef noodle, tender and juicy. Even their small quantity is good enough. The chilli is hot and flavoursome. Also the chicken rice is good, a bit on the sweeter side though."
"Spell COMFORT food. Their Sliced Beef Noodles never fail to amaze me. I tried it during sunny day and then rainy day and both tastes are exceptionally yummy and filling to the tummy. This is the go-to noodle that I would recommend to friends and family because it is like a homey dish that you will definitely crave from time to time! If you haven't tried it, please do. You won't regret it. "
"Very tasty sauce and tender beef, absolutely loving it!"
"Had superior beef noodles and sliced beef noodles w a side of vegetables. Great serving of vegetables at only $3.90 though sliced beef was tough. Would recommend the dry version more than the wet one (wet was just salty), superior beef and beef balls were nice!"
"The stall at the B1 foodourt is located outside the cashier exit of Cold Storage and has its own small area reserved for their customers.

Ordered the Superior Beef Noodles (Soup) at $10.90 and the ingredients given is good. A little pricier than normal though. Squeeze the lime into the chilli and don't forget the chinchalok!"
"Had a small bowl of their premium beef noodles (dry) and have to say I really enjoyed it!

Gravy was delicious, kway teow was perfect, cuts of shin meat, tendon & tripe was perfectly cooked and really tasty, and there was more than enough beansprouts, salted vegetables & parsley to keep me happy.

However, the one beef ball given was rubbery, the small portion costs $10+ (not cheap by any standards), and the regular beef slices were so so (slightly over-cooked & not too tasty).

The most disappointing was the chilli in my opinion. It had a real kick but it was just hot, without the sour-ness that one needs from beef noodle chilli. They provide chincalok and lime but it is not the same... now, I think this boils down to personal preference so maybe the chilli works for some, but it really did not do it for me.

How then do I still award this 4 stars? I guess given how much chilli matters to me, the fact that I still enjoyed my bowl of beef noodles without having the chilli is testament to how tasty it is - just stay away from the beef balls and regular sliced beef. I would also recommend the dry variant because although the soup is tasty enough, it lacks the full beefy goodness that the best beef noodle soups have; and as I mentioned above, the gooey gravy for the dry variant is delicious."
Yummy beef noodles. Hawker staple gone a bit upmarket and pricier. Good chilli
"Awesome broth! Ordered the dry mixed beef for $9.90, it's abit expensive but it's worth every cent"
Just bought beef noodle and had a nasty experience with a middle age store operator (man).  He acknowledge that they made a mistake in keying in the amount of cost for the food and keep quiet without trying to do anything.  Only upon insistent does he ask a lady manager to come and rectify the issue. The lady manager was apologetic and managed to do a bit of customer recovery but is limited by the middle age man who seems to have the final say .  Whole experience was highly unpleasant with a bit of recovery done.
"One of the few good beef noodles around. Loved the chili, super hot and spicy."
"Bad n rude service staff. I ordered 1 soup superior beef noodles and 1 dry sliced beef noodles for take away. The person gave me one big container and 1 small container. First he make ppl put their own condiments which I tot is not allowed during this COVID period due to hygiene? He's supposed to put it in for customers. Then he just threw 3 packs of chilli to me. So I tot it's all packed n go. To my horror when I got home, I realised he only gave me the superior beef noodles! The small container was just dry noodles n the big one is soup. He doesn't even bother to check or tell me my other noodles is pending! All he did was rudely telling other customer, who wanted to use the FAVE apps for 10% cash back, to figure out themselves how to use the apps cos he doesn't know. Aren't they supposed to know since they put the sign there for FAVE cash back?? This is the guy shorter n younger man, not the taller older man. Will not buy from them again due to hygiene and ultimate rudeness of the staff. I hope NEA or authorities can check the hygiene of this stall at parkway food court. Blanco court beef noodles."
Really good. Forgot to take photo. But it's excellent.
"Delightful, sums it up. I ordered the dry beef strips and balls. The sauce is delicious. Give my thumbs up and for the price, it was worth the queue."
Enjoyed the sliced beef noodles here. Broth was good and chili was shiok. They have favepay 10 % rebate here so good deal.
"Extremely lacklustre attitude and service from all the workers. Simply bo chap i can put it.

Then, to the noodles... im speechless again to the standard. Nothing near to whatever the high reviews were given.... Tucked away overcooked burnt noodles were mixed into my already sad $10 plate of noodles. Speechless.

Totally disappointed with my trip and food today.

Eat at your own risk and disappointment."
Good quality hokkien mee
"Chanced upon this new HKM shop after the coffeehouse was recently renovated. Decided to try the least priced portion $6.
There is no queue at 1130am. Had to wait about 10 mins before the buzzer rings. I think the chef was cooking a new batch.
For $6 portion, I get a wet version of HKM with 3 prawns, sotong, and some pork meat hidden in the noodles. A little bit of wok hei.
Very nice kick when adding their chilli. Chilly portion was self-serve.
The best part is the big chunks of crispy pork lard. Unfortunately, it's fixed portion served.

Overall, it is recommended and will eat again."
Yummy plate of HKT and friendly hawker owner!!  Delicious and good food portion!! Will be back again!
The Hokkien mee is superb!
"Generous portion, balanced taste, crispy pork lard and wonderful service. One of the best in woodlands definitely "
Really great plate of noodles with friendly staff and consistent portions and standards! Thanks!
"Very good plate of hokkien mee by a friendly young guy. As a Hokkien mee fan, this didn't disappoint."
Finally a decent hokkien mee in Woodlands!
Great plate of hokkien mee!
"Terrible experience here, completely burnt smell but clarify with staff they insisted the flavour is intentional and mentioned to add more chilli.
More like ""chao da mee"" it's not something that can be musked with chilli. Hope the staff will at least QC the taste before serving next time"
"Good hokkien mee. I ordered the $10 portion and it has five prawns, with some strips of pork and soton. The gravy is flavorful enough with slight wok hei. The lard is fragrant. Sambal chilli is good too, a lot of belachan. Waiting time is long during lunch hours but buzzer is given. I will come back again."
Hokkien mee wok hey is there and the seafood broth is rich but not overpowering! Very tasty plate of Hokkien mee  esp in the north area. This should be king of the north for Hokkien mee here
"Love the Hokkien mee here! Best HKM in woodlands for sure. Noodles are super flavourful, rich in prawn flavour and wok hey. Just right amount of wetness (not too dry, not too wet, enough gravy to hold the noodles and slurp it up without drying too fast). The chilli has a good kick, complements the noodles so well. I only ask that they add a bit more ingredients like pork slices!! but the prawns are really fresh . $6/plate is good enough for 1 pax. Last time I dabao also it was good, so I recommend both dining in and takeaway, not much difference in quality. If can, try the ba Chor mee right beside too. Love the signature BCM!"
One of the best Hokkien Mee I've eaten. Pack with wok hey and nicely deglaze. Chilli packs a punch.
Pretty good HKM! Got some wok hey and I loved the chilli. Giving 4 stars cos the prawn wasn't the freshest in my plate but still yummy despite that.
"Grew up with Hokkien mee, as a HKM hunter it's one of the best!"
One of the better HKM in Woodlands. Stall was accommodating that I don't eat squid and gave me more pork strips instead. Size is decent for the price. Coffeeshop gets very crowded during meal times so better to go during off peak hrs.
Repeat visit to the stall and standard remained consistently good. Nice wok hey and Unami. Chilli packs a punch 
"Finally a more than decent HKM around my place.

Born Hokkien Prawn Mee
This is a Wet version
Fresh Ingredients
Crispy Pork lard
Wok hey  on the milder side
Chilli 
Umami 6/10
Overall 7.5/10
I would be happy to rate 8.5 if the noodles are simmer abit longer and stronger umami flavour.
By the way taste is subjective"
"Searching for a decent plate of hokkein mee upon my dad's request after his hospital appointment at Woodlands Health Campus.
GOOGLE online and found great reviews of this stall. We decided to give it a try. The first mouth of hokkein mee my dad was impressed, reminded him of a old stall hokkein mee he always frequent go back till the owner passes on. And it's 25 yrs ago. My dad found a stall he can continue to come back again."
"Review on behalf of Missy; the mee broth is nice, prawn is not sodium infused and not super fresh (shell will stick), 3 prawn for $6.  A bit of ""wok hei"".  Chilli normal and what angry missy is the Zhu You Zha Lou Feng 
Smallest prawn is $6, whereas other places can get for $5.  Sotong also a bit nua nua... plus the plate can be rotated as u try to eat.  Despite the ranting, is still a good plate around should you feel like having a sotong mee.  However, If you want something better, travel to Hai Zhong Bao. . . 
Sample a few mouthful, indeed experience what she just said...."
"Finally a good sotong mee with wok hei! Fresh prawns, sotong and pork belly however I find the pork belly too much fats, would be better if a leaner cut is used. I prefer to pack it home and let the noodles absorb the umami broth.

Keep up the consistency! That's why great sotong mee, like Yisheng (ABC market, now retired) has only 1 and only branch and cooked by the same person. Same as with the other good ones without branches.

Used to like Youfu at Woodlands 780 but since opening up a few more shops around the island, the original chef which I like is no longer there and standard has dropped drastically.

Great addition to North-siders!"
"Unlike what other reviews mentioned, mine did not have any wok hei. Overheard an uncle from another table said he ordered when the stall first opened and the HKM was ""chao tar mee"" instead of Hokkien mee. Maybe the chef toned down on the wok hey from feedback he received.

For $6, you get 3 small to medium prawns, pork belly strips and a few pieces of sotong. Overall a good plate of HKM still."
Very nice plate of hokkien mee. The gravy was very flavourful. Strongly recommend others to try too
"A decent plate of hokkien mee. Attitude of the cashier is good, prawn is abit mushy with some shell intact and pork lard is not so fresh n not cripsy.  Wok hei is abit mild but Nontheless still a very decent plate of hokkien mee, hope to see some improvement the next round I come."
The wok hei + the soup base + well made lard make this Hokkien mee so addictive. Friendly store owner makes it an impressive experience in an unassuminng coffeeshop .
very good hkm 10/10 generous portion
"A good plate of Hokkien mee, highly recommended!!"
New hokkien mee stall near home! Owner was nice and accommodating! Hokkien mee is watery type (the best type) and its super tasty!! Asian parents approved too 
Two thumbs up!!!
Finally woodlands near my house have a good Hokkien mee. The one and only staff are friendly with polite.  Try it
"Went to tried this newly opened Hokkien Mee just outside of Woodlands TEL exit. The portion given was generous. Chilli was packed separately in a container, good for ppl who don't take spicy food. Hokkien mee was flavourful and ""wet"" enough for my liking. Got wok hei too! Will visit often for HKM craving!"
"Finally, we have good Hokkien mee in Woodlands! Really tasty--got that wok hei. The chili is spicy with a nice sour kick. So satisfying!"
Really good with the chili. People who are interested wet version can give a try
"prawn noodles is nice with wok hey, will be better if the gravy is thicker and chilli is nice. Overall quite tasty and portion is great."
"The prawn noodles has wok hei taste, the chilli is super nice! Overall is good"
Same great taste as other outlet!
"Awesome hokkien mee, abit salty but acceptable. Flavourful"
"The broth is really flavourful, noodle is tender everything just tasted just nice, will order more in future!"
Zhe Ge Hokkien mee Zhen De Bu Cuo Chi...
"Good food very nice wok hey and not too dry, broth is flavorful"
Very good n delicious hokkien mee 10/10
Serve a Burned Prata.
Aircon food court 
"Hidden jem. Mix of fast food and local. Nice place, very clean."
"Has been wanted to try this stall for the longest time. There's always a queue for good reasons, especially old folks in the queue. With its serving and taste, it's definitely value for money at the current economy climate. Although this place is hidden in the neighborhood, it's all time busy. There are 4 dumplings for the plate of $4 noodle. Filings are full & compact and there are prawn inside as well. Noodle is springy and not soggy. Next time going to try their chicken rice, should be as good as the noodle."
"Counter short hair Auntie at Ban Mian store (3rd store of air con place) very rude, snatches money from me when I pay for food. CAN YOU TAKE IT GENTLY FROM ME.  I everytime buy from her, she still give me THIS ATTITUDE. WON'T BUY FROM THIS STALL ANYMORE. HAHAHA"
"The best stall in this aircon coffee shop definitely is Ming Ji Chicken Rice (Ming Ji Ji Fan). We have roast chicken tigh rice + white chicken rice with egg. Can you imagine total costs less than $8!! The best thing about chicken rice is not only the price but the rice (frangance), chicken tender, and chilli shiok.

* The only bad thing is the drink kiosk staff, super attitude *"
"Air-conditioning eating place near our home, where my wife and I came to have our breakfast after our morning brisk walk.

A very convenient place with shops, supermarket, wet market and other eateries."
"Whenever I come here, and I have visited a few times over the last 3 years, they never can do the traditional breakfast as they don't have enough staff, the staff they do have are always very grumpy with poor attitudes. Coffee is not too bad and is cheap"
The Aircon is cold and suitable for such hot and humid conditions. It adds to the taste of the food as well. It is quite fantastic to have such good food stalls hidden in this part of Singapore. Certainly it is a well known destination for the locals living nearby around here. And thanks to one of them for bringing me to this place.
"Food here is mediocre at best.
Good thing is that there is (some) aircon here."
good service
Prawn noodle
It is harder to get a table for dining in during evenings recently.
"Nice food, hawkers are friendly too"
Chicken rice at the air-con good court is best. For duck rice  gonna go to the non air-court food court.
"Air-conditioned environment, be here earlier during peak hour as there isn't much seating."
Small number of stalls but air-conditioned nevertheless.
Clean and comfortable
If you go there you have to try the laksa and Fish ball noodles. It is delicious.
Food quality is decent not exceptional.
"The zichar's Ma La Xiang Guo taste good, but a bit oily. Korean Kimchi soup is above average. Malay stall's homemade nasi lemak is recommended."
"Most inner inside of the broadway coffee shop at 883 north plaza
never ever buy any bar cho mee or noodle from the stall a very rude aunt anyhow shout at customer not only me she shouted , she also shouted at my husband"
Rude drinks staff
No service (coffee service)
Aircom not cleaning.
"love the curry rice stall, ban mee and minced meat noodles, prawn noodles and loh mee. goes almost every week"
The food is so tasty!

Normal food court but comfortable
Is air conditioned food court. Zi Char is quite ok and reasonably priced.
"Many local and authentic choices. Chicken rice, wanton noodle, local fried and hot pot, some dimsum, economic rice, etc."
A stall selling prawn mee  lomee  dry and soup meat or fish ball mee good taste
"Shops usually close very early, not much variety on food selections. Air conditioned but doesn't do justice to the food as it gets cold too fast. No drinks server at times and can be a bit too crowded."
Great variety of cheap good food.
Good Malaysian style Bak kut teh (pork ribs soup) here! Very reasonable and nice stall owner too. Try the pork trotters and claypot chicken too.
Many items to choose
Good food at reasonable prices. Free parking during lunch. Extremely rare in Singapore.
"Yu Pian Mi Fen,Jing Ji Mi Fen,Rou Gu Cha,Ka Li Jian Dao"
Situated on level 2. Wheelchair accessible with lift. Food is mediocre. People there are friendly though...
Dun drink the uncle kopi
"Nice food, good environment"
Chicken rice is nice
"Looks isolated but offers 2 food courts with wide varieties of local food. Usual tenants of provision shops, supermarket and wet market."
Decent neighbourhood eating place
"Kerk's Kopitiam~ Food was okay but service is very bad. We waited and waited but turned out there was a miscommunication with our order.
Apparently the 3 servers were confused as to what we ordered and what we paid for. Additionally, situation wasn't handled well. Auntie was loud when we acquired about it and it attracted attention (embarrassing!!)
10/10 wld not go again if have the choice"
"Mei Wei,You Te Se"
"Bah kut teh is nice
Porridge from chicken rice is nice"
"Zhe Ka Pei Dian De Shi Wu Huan Suan Bu Cuo,Jie Qian Ye Bu Gui. "
Nice food court
Not a lot of food stalls
No vegetarian food its not cpmplete.
Hen Hao Chi. OKYou 4DXia Zhu Hen Hao
Not too bad but there's better food in woodlands.
"Zhe Li De Yong Feng Yu Yuan Mian,Xiang Lai Rou Gu Cha,Ji Fan Deng Deng Du Fei Chang Mei Wei"
Has decent selection of hawker foods but nothing special. The thai stall is value for money
The Economy Noodles the best stall there. Chicken wings and the chillis are the best.
"Zui Li Mian You Jia Tai Guo Cai,Bian Yi Hao Chi"
"Food prices are higher here compared to the non-aircon food centre beside. Try to avoid the mixed rice stall as their prices do not reflect what they stated, and they don't inform you beforehand the difference in price between different types of vegs. You can get similar food at a cheaper price if you don't mind non-aircon environment."
The Thai Food stall is back!
"An aircon foodcourt with quite a number of good fool stalls. the fishball noodle, yong tau foo and the indian stall is good."
One of the best Hokkien mee. Uncle is very friendly.
Finally got to eat this after a few years later. Made a trip down to eat this hokkien mee which I was always eating when I was staying nearby there. I bought 2 packets which 1 of them was eaten after reheating the next day. Noodles were still Al Dente. Taste is still fabulous. Thanks Uncle & Auntie for retaining the same taste after so many years. Will see you guys again soon!
Normal food court setting in an industrial building. Was there yesterday for lunch. My new must go back  hokkien mee place. Owner uncle is super  serious about his craft and friendly as well.
Decent plate of no frills HKM! Comes in $5/6/8! Took the $6 came with 3 prawns and gernerous amount of pork belly + sotong! Lady boss is friendly! Place is cooling with huge ceiling fan! Recommended! Extra chilli + 2 limes to fill my hungry stomach!
"I enjoyed the hokkien mee!!! It was flavorful with some wokhey. I liked how the noodle texture was still QQ and chewy, not overly soft like many other places. Recommend to try!"
"Fellow HKM lovers love this brand some dislike it
Somehow this stall haven't fail to disappoint me to the extend of not coming back

Infact, whenever I drop by woodlands...it does attract me to once again savour it.

Friendly owner , always asking me if the taste is still good!

Strong Unami taste, crunchy pork lards with generous amount of belly and sotong.

Once again, it has not failed me."
No queue but I thought I would give it a try and was pleasantly surprised. Tasty with wok hei.
"Quite one of the worse HKM I ever had. The stall owner basically just heat up what in the wok and served me. The noodle is cold, sticked together and taste gummy. 2 miserable small prawn, some fat pork and burnt eggs. Not to mention the portion is pathetic, not that I wanna it bigger.

Instant noodle cooked at home taste better and warmer. Avoid at all cost even if this is the last HKM stall in Singapore."
"creamy and delicious.

Friendly hawker"
"Tastes like an average bowl of Hokkien mee for $5. Maybe the store charge high price because of its branding.

Would have taste nicer if it's hotter but since I came at a non peak period, the owner just made hot what he had in the wok and served it."
"I am not sure why it's popular. It has absolutely no prawn stock taste, no eggs and taste bland!
Will never eat there again."
Ordered medium size. Taste good
Abit wet kind of hokkien mee.. suits me 
Best Hokkien mee i have eaten by far.
super rude
rude staff
Cockroach encounter. Eat at your own risk. Uncle did apologise but I guess it was an unforgivable mistake for food handlers. Unable to upload picture for some reasons.
"The taste is there. But sadly, not piping hot enough. Some of the noodles still sticking together. Don't think I will order again. I came on a weekday at 4pm."
"I was craving Hokkien Mee for the longest time, and decided to give this a good, no doubt it tasted good- i had the worst food poisoning post having it... very disappointed [it was my only meal for the whole day, so am pretty sure this triggered it]"
"Ordered for dinner via delivery, and received my food promptly without fuss. The hokkien mee is yummy, will patronise again to support them!"
"When a shop displays only one item on its menu, you know they mean business. Despite frequenting the area around Woodlands 11, I tried the Hokkien Mee here for the first time today.

Great: The noodle was well cooked, with a balanced texture, not over cooked, but not hard either. Just the right kind which makes for a great hearty meal. The broth that it is cooked with is flavourful as well.

Negative: The $4 portion was a slightly small, and likely insufficient for a hearty lunch. The proteins that  is served with it is also very limited. They make up for the lack of ingredients with plenty of lard for great flavour. Not very nutritious in general, but that's hawker fare for you.

Overall, I'd be happy to eat it anytime I'm around the area again. That being said, probably not too often since it's not very nutritious, and probably the $5 option the next time round."
Best hokkien in woodland! Recommended for people staying in that area! Very Delicious hokkien mee!
"Love the Uncle here!!! i go there at least once a week or more!
Been with him everywhere he go from marsiling mall to woodlands 11
Strongly Recomend 10/10"
Ordered via grabfood - hokkien mee was pretty decent and the black carrot cake was yummy! Not sure why the previous reviews were so bad. Very value for money!
"Ordered from food panda, the taste is very blend, no spring onions and only abt 3 bits of sotong and afew bits of egg, basically just noodles with slices of pork bcos I added for 2$. Added egg for the oyster egg bcos I needed to hit the min order but it looks like normal. Feeling cheated and disappointed."
"Like to order the 'Opeh' leaf packing at $5 for takeaway in the past, but after the price increased to $8 don't eat anymore. The reason is paying $8 but the quantity look like $5 and $3 is for that ...leaf :("
It's really tasty and nice!  Worth coming here to eat:)
"A decent bowl of fish ball noodle or BCM.  Not too teochew style. But the noodle is good.  Well cook I meant.   The bowl of pigs liver is very good n Tasty   But can be too oily
The soup is goos. Very tasty"
"Honestly, this place is only edible between 8am and 8pm. The staff manning the stall at night can't cook well and are terrible service wise. Always getting simple orders wrong and always seem annoyed when I gently remind them what my order actually was. This happens on the regular even when it's not busy. 2 stars here is an average of the daytime and nighttime food quality (4 stars and 0 stars respectively)"
Noodle sauce was of the humble industrial park kopitiam variety with the noodles cooked slightly soft.  Placed in a plastic container which doubled as the lid of the cardboard bowl for the soup - great packaging!  Soup was flavourful without being overpowering.  Liver in the soup was cooked to the powdery texture that some people prefer.  Meat balls were bouncy and there was a pronounced taste of that fried salted fish (dried flounder powder?) that is so addictive.  Liver dishes were wonderfully rare and tender with a slight bounce on the bite - i prefer this style.  Tasted fresh enough to eat raw (thinking of korean raw liver).  I couldn't tell the difference between the signature sauce and the nonya sauce but they were both nice.
"Noodles are average tasting but the star is the pig's liver. I ordered the meatball and fishball noodle but added on the liver since I saw that it was their signature dish and was NOT disappointed.

Their pork liver was soft and springy and the smell wasn't overpowering. I've always thought that liver was hard and chewy with a strong smeel and kinda hated it but here it's changed my view. I'd recommend their pig's liver noodles over the other dishes.

The auntie was also friendly in answering questions since it was my first time ordering."
So expensive for so little quantity. Paid almost 18 bucks for 2 medium sized packs and ate both in one seating to feel full. I think they confuse themselves with a fine dining restaurant with their portions. The taste and flavour is good but I'm not satisfied when my stomach still growling after eating
"Pros:
Great noodle texture.
Flavourful soup.
Liver was cooked on the spot and done just right - not overcooked.

Cons:
Vinegar used had a bitter after taste.
Meat balls had a sandy texture.
For $5.30 noodle quantity was quite little."
Competent but not a bowl I would specially seek out. Need to manage expectations given the other glowing reviews...
"Edit: Came back for supper one night and decided to try the Zhao Pai Mian Xian mee sua. I highly recommend this one - the mee sua is not overcooked, the bcm sauce is unusual for mee sua but I feel it goes quite well together. Pork liver and meatballs are bomb as usual and the broth is extra yummy this late at night. Best part is that it costs only $8.50 after adding extra noodles and pork liver!

------

Very decent bowl of bcm, meatballs and fishballs were all handmade and the broth is very rich and flavourful. The liver was beautifully cooked, actually one of the best liver I've had in Bak Chor Mee.

Noodles were slightly overcooked and vinegar and chilli got no kick. Not spicy enough. Mee Kia is abit different from the usual. The upsized $7 Yuan Yang noodle set only came with meatballs and fishballs, no sliced pork or liver which was a bummer.

Overall was a very decent meal, will come back again."
"Great value Mee Pok  added the meat ball and extra liver. Tip avoid the sauce on the liver.
Well presented tasty breakfast"
"Probably the Best Bak Chor Mee I've had in a long time.
The noodles were firm and full of texture.
The Bak Chor Mee soup was full of minced pork, pork slices were tender and lived the pork balls.
But the real star was the pork liver.
Probably the best I had eaten in a food court or coffeeshop.
It was fresh, tender, springy and full of texture and flavour. The liver was thick and Not over cook, with generous amounts in the soup.

Definitely deserve a 5 Star rating."
One of the best char siu in sg
"Ordered Char siew and roast pork with rice for $6, food wise it was quite ok but not overly fantastic in my opinion.
I finished all the meat as it wasn't a lot and as I have about 50% rice left so I wanted top up abit more roast meat but the guy insisted on charging me $6 when a normal plate of roast pork with rice is $5.
Left with a sour taste as it didn't make sense to me to be charged $6 when it cost $2.50 more to add more meat at the beginning.
Probably business too good, take it or leave it.
Anyway, I am off to another roast meat stall!"
"This is one of the best so far. The Roasted Pork just melt in your mouth. The Char Siew  Whatever choice you choose.  Be it fatty or lean.

The car park here is spacious.
Just check on the hour opening.
"
"Ordered Char siu and roasted pork $6. $6?! still havent include the takeaway charge somemore, crazy shit. I know la ur business good then charge so high but whats the point? Still not the best also slight better than average only leh. So many good reviews and long queues everyday but portion also quite pathetic sia eat alr like snack liddat."
"Hands down one of the best Char Siu one can find in Singapore. I hope they never close down.

One thing that I thought could be improved would be their availability of certain fatty portions. I was told that they only had the lean meat when I tried to order, but seems like they managed to find other non lean parts.

The Roast Pork was also greatly delicious, but Char Siu, their namesake, is the one to go for if you had to choose only one."
Very nicely roasted meats! Tasty chicken rice as well. Friendly store proprietors.
"This outlet at Woodlands is a total disappointment. No quality control of char siew. It is hard as rock, burnt (char ta) and not juicy. Totally turnoff!

The chilli is kind of salty. I tried 2 times takeaway and still very bad quality. Will not buy anymore."
Always a delight.
I can said one of the best Cha Shao Shao Rou Fan at the North side.
"We ordered half fat, Char Siu was really good. Roasted pork was dry."
Really use  to roast.. 
"Able to chose the % of your lean meat
Taste great
Come with free soup"
"Char siew siew rou rice is great as usual, fragrance rice with lean tender char siew. Boss is friendly & patience. I took one star off because the food handler did not put on mask. When stalls started initially, food handlers do put on mask. These days, i don't see them wearing mask. He chat with customers over the food. With covid incidents, i think all food handlers should be mindful of Hygiene aspect. I usually avoid buying food from stalls if food handler has no mask on."
Same as AMK branch. Service is good and fast. Friendly boss and staffs. The coffee shop is also clean and vibrant.
Heard a lot of good comments so expectation is high. Better than normal but not the best. No more fatty char siu so a bit disappointed.
"Their meat is nice but give only little bit. Taste wise is all right, portion size is small. Also will run out of soup very often."
"Another great discovery!  The Char Siu and roasted pork were great, and the roasted chicken was amazing!  So far, the best  I have eaten ... it's more than  5 star !"
"It's ok, prices on high side esp in middle of woodlands, cut up ready to consume meats also very slow which contributed more to the Q. Rice portioning for individual add ons to ala carte meats very stingy."
"Ordered 3 meat for $8.

The good
Omg the taste of char siew and pork belly are fantastic. They didn't ask for how fat i want, i assume they gave medium which is good but i will probably ask for fattest the next time.

Tenderness has much room for improvement.

Chili is typical of chicken rice chili so you can't go wrong.

Weakness
Okay the chicken is pretty average. The rice is mediocre when compare to other chicken rice. But slightly my fault. When it is coated with all the oil the taste came out."
"Decent plate of roast pork and char siu. Not giving five stars as it is pricier and quantity is lesser compared to other coffee shops in Woodlands (e.g. Blk 311 and Blk 354) that serve equally good, if not better, roast pork and char siu rice. Don't like the taste of the soup. It's not clear but with bits of white pork lard floating on top, making it greasy and odd tasting."
Very good fatty char siu. You can choose how lean your char siu is. A la carte is $12. The sauce is also very good and not too sweet. They also sell roast pork and chicken. Can pay with paylah. This Coffeeshop also has other famous food stalls like Aw's fishball noodles and 165 prawn noodles.
"My pick for best roast meat & char siew combo in the north. Char siew sauce is nice, so is the soup. Cost a bit more than other stalls but good value for this quality."
"Absolutely delicious, everything is good - meat, rice, soup and even price is reasonably good! Best part is you get to choose meat fatty level to your likeing."
"The stall name sounded familiar, then realized from the media cut-out on the pillar that it's the toto winner's stall that I previously read abt.

Dabao back since I already had lunch. The meats definitely one of the best around and possibly the thickest cut I've seen from a hawker stall. I like that you can choose the fat/lean ratio of the char siu which I'll probably choose the lean cut next round as the half fat & lean I had today was more of the fatty side. Surprised that they uses chicken rice rather than white rice which I actually prefer the latter, but with gravy of cos."
"Really one of the best char siu and roasted meat that I have eaten and even better than some restaurants. I ordered the half fatty char Siew and the fats just melt in your mouth. The roasted meat as fragrant and no ""porky"" smell!! Rice was fragrant and the service was prompt after some queueing! Kudos to the young couple who took pride in their craft and present such good and favourable food that is affordable for the masses. A most enjoyable brunch!! $6 for a plate with nice chilli too!! Gambate!!"
"Happened to read the Eight days coverage on this. Have heard of the Toto winner boss and his outlet but didn't manage to patronise it then. So happy that another outlet opened in the north! It's just is day 2 of operation.

Went back again today (30 May) for fresh dine-in experience. Everything did not disappoint!

The chilli is just so shiok... Tangy enough with a decent kick! Yum! 

So my opinion? One of the best melt in your mouth char siu and crispy sau rou around. Value for money too! No need to go to Laifaba anymore for delish wanton noodle. You can choose from fatty, mid level or lean cuts. It would seem that such standards of char siu and sau rou is becoming more of the norm, thanks to skills being handed down.

I dabao home and they stay delish!"
"Today is woodlands 326 reopening day after renovating. Very impressed by the standard of charsiew. Liked that they ask for your fatty preference and I went for the fattiest and was very impressed by the standards! This area is lacking a good roast stall as almost every other have closed down. Charsiew was very fatty and soft, roast pork has the perfect crust.

Hope the standards remain like this even after opening day! Residents in this area are about to gain some weight"
"Been buying chicken rice from this uncle for many years, since the time he was at block 166. Best chicken rice and curry chicken noodle around Marsiling MRT area.."
10 cents extra just to ask for a sharing plate? you must be out of your mind. Won't patronise.
"Price on the higher side for half chicken. However, it still taste good."
4.50 for a chicken rice that looks like those at the MRT station. Haiz... Inflation...
Roast pork/chicken rice is excellent.
The service was very fast and they were very polite.
"Chicken rice nice and chilli power.
The staff Firdaus Zairul Hisham is friendly and always smile when i bought the chicken rice.
Will always buy the chicken rice there again whenever i passby the area."
Generous servings and friendly hawker and his wife. I've been eating there for the past 7 years
"Got my beloved chicken rice within a few mins. Extra rice, extra meat. One might think it wouldn't be prepared well considering the speed it took but it's AMAZING. Thank for you satisfying my chicken rice needs. Will come back tor more. This time extra extra rice and chicken "
"Mediocre and expensive.  Shreds of meat and bones. I paid extra for egg and upon returning home, discovered they didn't add on the egg at all.

Taste is normal.  Service is curt and unwelcoming.  Better go elsewhere as better chicken rice shops are aplenty."
"The vegetable rice there is used to be very nice with affordable price but nowadays the price keeps going up yet the portion is getting smaller. There is a staff looks like an Auntie is very rude. She scolded with sharp & loud voice to my friend when my friend asked for more veggie source as the rice was too dry. This incident happened on Tuesday, 01 April 2025 at 2:35pm.

Their service attitude is terrible."
"The char kway teow stall in thus coffee shop is our favourite ! Their prices start from $2.50.. U can do $3, $3.50, $4 . Portions and the number of prawns will go up according w the price. The char kway teow definitely got 'wok hei' ..we buy from them pretty often and i will say their standard is always v consistent The 2 men working in the stall always have cheerful faces .. Definitely recommend that u check them out"
"A plate of economy bee hoon, 1 piece of fish cake and fried cabbage veg for $4.70. This has got to be the most ridiculous and expensive stall serving ""economy"" bee hoon. And it taste morbid."
Veg lovers will like this Char Kway Teow Salad cos tons of bean sprouts and chives
"Aunty and Uncle always scope a lot of food for me, and can use shopback and grab pay as well :)"
$5.50 for 2 vegetables and 1 meat
"Fu Wu Tai Du Zhen De Hen Chai,Bu Jian Yi Qu Ti Yan"
"Unbelievable!! Still can find Penang ckt with 2 prawns included @ $2.50!!  Good wok hei!

Varieties of local delights. Cheap and good.
"Mixed rice has always tasted good. But today, got the shock of my life. AS I WAS EATING, I SAW THIS WORM ON MY VEGETABLES. I took a photo but I don't know why I can't find the feature to attach my photo."
"Had their economic noodles and the only reason I gave them 3 stars is cos the chilli sauce is nice and slightly sweet. Noodles, etc so so only."
"Becareful about this stall economic rice , they served the food with dirty dishes , when you asked about it they say its the reflection until I proved to them at the counter ."
"Penang char kwa tiew, food is prepared upon order individually, ordered $3 , came with loads of bean sprouts , 2 prawns , can opt for chili or no chili version. Overalls. With the price it is quite a steal !
Where else to find $2.50 Zi Char kwa tiew ?"
"The Mala pot here is nice, curry chicken also not bad.
The best is the ten here, most flavourful one."
"One of the lady I think the most older one. Face like no happy when I arrived to counter.
I bought take away (Shan Xi Liand Pi )Then, she didn't care put into plastic bag my noodle. Then ,I take the plastic bag, the bowl is drop onto counter. She didn't care and she take another order. Pls check CCTV how she rude like that. I'm not first time customer but tonight is last time to visit."
"Nice mixed rice, tho price bit ex, $4.1 for rice with egg, french beans and fried chicken"

I did ntg by just ordering food  1st and the last time"
their food cannot be eat see propely the picture
Hawkers delights! Varieties of homemade cooking including fresh fish meat pork beef chicken prawns and vegetables to go with rice. Takeaway and seating available. Love the fried noodles. Freshly prepared food with healthy ingredients tender loving skillful cooking and warm services. Conveniently located at neighbourhood heartland of Admiralty Place in MRT and bus stations next to Kampung Admiralty and Admiralty wet market with plenty of dinning shopping banking supermarkets groceries sundries postage services and amenities. Walking  distance to 24 Hours Sheng Siong supermarket. Friendly cosy comfy welcoming ambience for romantic intimates groups students expats locals visitors and families.
Very rude auntie. Asked me if I want chili. I asked if can lesser spicy. She replied in a super rude manner Ni Yao Huan Shi Bu Yao. Bad customer service and no chill.
Noodle was very salty.
"The food quality is not so good, despite the portion size is not generous also. There are barely any ribs in the pork rib and potato dish, and the potatoes are hard to chew. The twice cooked pork taste stale, and the eggplant is super oily. In general don't come here if you are a Chinese looking for authentic home food."
Typical Chinese Sichuan stall serving varieties of Sichuan Delights. Prompt service and the food is good.
"$5.50 pork rib potato rice.
Taste is ok. Minus 9f the bone pork meat quantity not so much. Potato some soft some hard. Generally is ok."

"Thats true, food standard is very 'depends on your luck'. Went few times, sometimes it's OK but today is terrible. Liang Mian noodles is hard and tasteless. Shou Si Bao Cai also tasteless today, and hard, not well cooked. Jiu Cai Rou Si is ok. And the cashier lady today also a little bit bad temper."
"This place serves really delicious Sichuan dishes! I've eaten at this place multiple times and till date we have tried la zi ji, poached fish, Mapo tofu, tomato egg, steamed dumplings, kou shiu ji, you mak vegetable, assorted noodle dishes. We usually worry about over-ordering due to their generous serving portions but yet also always ending up clearing all the dishes with ease as the dishes are really appetizing and comforting. In my opinion, this place is comparable to some big restaurants in Chinatown but at half the price. Will definitely return!"
"$5.50 for ginger onion beef w rice, sooooo worth! Beef cooked nicely and not overly salty. Think its family run, everyone's very friendly and nice too! Ordered their yang chow fried rice before and it's cooked well too!"
The lady got attitude problem. Food cannot make it.
"Nice cuisine, though a little bit salty"
Really spicy! Very filling portion.
"Ordered Cong You Gan Ban Mian, braised beef noodle and steam dumplings. Ban mian was very fragrant. Beef noodle soup was flavorful. Noodle was Q. Meat was on the saltier side. Steam dumpling was good, filling had a good mix of meat and vegetables. Service was quick and easy."
"Their taste of food not consistent, sometimes taste good, sometimes don't, When I crave for the Dao Xue Mian however the taste changed again to bad, soup tastes bland, noodles clumpy, the previous time when I ate it a few weeks ago, it was so much better, a lot more savoury and tasty, worth the price...Hope that your shop can be more consistent in flavour... disappointed"
"Pan fried dumpling very tasty, juicy and crispy. $5.50 for 10 pcs"
"Another store am trying for the first time, have wanted to try here for a long time as there is usually a line. Am trying their Bean Paste Noodle Zha Jiang Mian. Pleasantly surprised by the taste, slightly spicy as I've ordered. Very flavorful and the noodle is al dente. Yummilicious pork sauce and fresh cucumber. I chowed everything down very quickly. Mmm mmm good! 
BTW, they do sell separately their home made dumplings Wo Tie at $6 per pack of 10 pieces where you can cook at home yourself. The hawker pack everything for you. Nice!!!
Looking forward for their other dishes."
"This stall is still one of my favourite stalls in the hawker centre at Marine Parade Central. The owner is always so friendly to customers and she even once gave me an extra serving of noodles for free after making a small error with my order. Probably because she knows me as a regular customer. The quality of their dishes varies from dish to dish though. My top favourites are their chilli oil dumplings, liangpi, and chicken cutlet noodles. If you are ordering takeaway, remember to ask for the soup to be packed separately."
Great staff and reliable & tasty hawker food! Try the dumplings in red oil!
"We found the Tomato & Egg Noodles (4/10) disappointing and difficult to finish.

The soup, which should have been the highlight with its slurp-worthy, slightly thickened consistency, fell short. It tasted overwhelmingly artificial, dominated by tomato ketchup and MSG, and lacked the tanginess, natural sweetness, and savory depth expected from a proper tomato-based broth.

The dish included black fungus, scallions, bok choy, tomatoes, and scrambled eggs. The ingredients provided a pleasant textural contrast to the base, especially the plentiful scrambled eggs. Unfortunately, the noodles were slightly soggy upon takeaway."
Top tier dumplings and noodles!
"Amazing noodle. Helmed by PRC owners, they certainly know noodles well. Tried the ja Jiang noodles + sour and spicy noodles - all top notch."
"I am a regular customer of the food stall. It is such a disappointment the food quality dropped terribly with the new hired stall helper. He seriously know nothing about Chinese food and give us a very terrible food experience.... We ordered cold noodle. And fried dumpling. The cold noodle come without gravy! Plain dry noodle!!!! How do you expect ppl to eat ???  Fried dumpling not fried 5 percent with a little yellowish in.color and taste sooooo soft Like a steam one. Damn blur sotong
..... Rubbish"
Noodle dishes are good at this store. Would recommend the beef/pork noodles as well as the zhajiangmian. The chilli paste is solid. Dumplings were pretty average. Filling is decent but the skin (guotie)/sauce (chilli oil wanton) were unimpressive.
"Noodles were springy. However, the vegetables had a horrible plastic taste to them and the beef was really tough.

Dumplings were average tasting, nothing special.

Still quite disappointed in the taste."
Reviewing their Tomato Egg Noodle bowl! Good slurpy noodles in delicious tomato soup broth. Paired with yummy pan fried egg. $5 may be slightly pricey but it's good option for non-meat eaters.
"Jiao Zi Hen Hao Chi!Bu Ai Chi Cai De Wo,Du Ai Shang Ta De Jiao Zi Xian!"
"uncle is very nice and even apologised to customers when the wait got too long

food taste good and authentic, really liked the handmade dumplings !!"
Good and Authentic food at a reasonable price!

"Visited in June. Very crowded and noisy hawker centre. Could not find seats so we had to takeaway. The dumplings are delicious! The boss' wife is efficient and courteous. Quite a crowded stall with different customers buying noodles, etc."
"All is good...worthy ..
here the red oil copy hand is more  worthy den DTF... can have 2 bowls here!
stall is short of staffs so do note that you have to wait.. no doubt I will come back here again !!"
Taste of the fried dumpling is not bad but because they were rushing the skin was not fully cooked. Service is not great as they forget your orders of there is a crowd.

Hong You Chao Shou is good"
I always get the Hong You Chao Shou whenever I eat there! It's got great texture and flavor!

"The aunty shows bad attitude. The dumplings was not cooked properly, was still pretty raw when served, I ask her to cook longer, she was very unhappy. She cooked again after the uncle confirmed it's still raw. I had diarrhea after eating it. Will never come back again."
"Ordered the xiao long bao.  It was made fresh and the meat inside, though not as much as expected, was flavourful.  The skin was on the thick side.$5 for six."
"~Review Verdict~
Price: ~S$5

Food:     
Service:     

Value: 

Super frustrating experience.

They took my order, and I only had one order btw and they totally forget about it, make me wait for 45 mins when there was barely any queue. The people who came after me got their orders served first in 10 minutes, meanwhile I just waited and waited.

Would I wait 45 minutes for this mediocre beef noodle? No? It's average at best. The beef is slightly tough, the soup is mehhh.. only the noodles were okay..

Never coming back again."
"The foods taste nice, will order tomatoes noodle soup, pork chop noodles, and zha jiang mian, chilli and ginger provided. Highly recommend"
"Located in Marine Parade Central food Center. Tried beef noodles this time round, noodles was springy while beef could be cooked to more tenderness & soup needs improvements (slight sour aftertaste). Previously tried the mala beans paste minced pork noodles, fiery hot & spicy. Awesome for spice lovers. Overall reasonable pricing, food to satisfy China Chinese noodles cravings. Courtesy & friendly staffs."
"Rude service ,they are free but not even want to complete pack well before customer take the cointaner away ,food was ok but always wrong order ,dissapointed to the service."
"Long queue but worth the wait. I always get the mala dumpling noodles (not in the menu, you have to ask for it) or the Hong You Chao Shou noodle. The spice is very shiok, and they have a rather good portion, worth the price. They also open quite late which is good if you are looking for a late dinner. The dumplings are not bad, although the skin could be better. I really recommend the mala. The tomato egg soup is another good one for those who can't handle the spice."
The best Hong You Chao Shou maybe? Comparable to dtf/paradise group but cheaper 
Not bad .....
Za Jiang Mian was quite authentic. Delicious. But portion is a bit small. Meat sauce also limited. XLB could be better. Skin was a bit thick.
Really good noodles.
"Tried no.14 Cold Noodles and didn't know what to expect. It turned out to be a little sweet and spicy, kinda like a cold noodle dessert with slice beef and veggies. Somewhat like Korean noodles too. Definitely must add lotsa chili and a bit of vinegar. Interesting. It's alright but I won't order again. I'll try the others next time."
"6 mini xiao long bao Xiao Long Bao for $5 and I wasn't impressed. These dumplings were not served hot at all and seemed like processed food. Soup was sorely lacking and the skin was too thick.

It was also a very long wait for the food to be ready, which made the experience even more underwhelming. Presentation wise, the dumplings were also not served in the traditional dim sum wooden baskets but transferred onto a plate. Disappointing."
"Tried the dumplings and had to wait quite a while.

The meat filling is well seasoned and quite salty and the skin is quite thick. Overall, have tasted better dumplings at other shops and will not order again.

Saw a long queue at the shop. Perhaps will try other dishes if I'm in the area again."
"I had the tomato egg noodles. Very very yummy. Probably one of the best tomato egg noodles i had. Noodles al dente, soup is not starchy. Egg has wok hei. Nice."
"Had their GUO TIE (pan fried dumplings). It was good. When you bit into it the moisture form the meat filing just burst out. The filing was also tasty. Skin of the dumplings were nice as well. Crispy and good.
However there were 2 pieces of dumplings  that broke? Like you could see their meat as seen in the pictures. It was not that I purposely broke it to show the inside but that it was already broke when I opened it.
Overall the dumplings are really a value for money."
My favourite go to for a hearty bowl of Chinese noodles. Always get the dumpling noodles (no.10) and leave satisfied every time. Very clean stall and nice staff. 10/10 recommend.
"After a day of skateboarding, this place was the perfect place for dinner. Had the fried dumplings and the spicy dumplings in red oil. Yum!"
Popular Chinese food stall in hawker center. Good variety of tasty food at reasonable price.
"Whenever i feel like having a bowl of not sinful mee sua, i visit this stall. Lots of ingredients and the taste is just nice."
"The first time I tried it (takeaway), I thought it was overhyped as the noodles were a little overcooked. Recently gave this place a second try (dine in) and was pleasantly surprised by the meesua. Cooked just nice. Hence, I recommend you guys to dine in than to take away. I know the seats in kampung admiratly is really nonexistent during peak hours. I will strongly only recommend you to get this if you found a seat."
"Quite tasty, but the stock could be better in my opinion"
"I am not able to take alcohol and i didn't know that they will add alcohol in the meesua.

Went back to confirm with them if they did add alcohol and the china aunty was so rude and defensive.

I ended wasting a bowl of food."
"The minced pork quality of Ah Ma Mee Sua@Kampong Admiralty had DEFINITELY GONE DOWN THE DRAIN.

Visited their stall@12.20pm on 04Apr25, the slice pork are ALL COOKED. But the minced pork balls are ALL NOT COOKED.

The outer layer of the minced pork balls are whitish (cooked),however once u cut open the MINCED PORK BALL, u could see ALL REDDISH on the Inside (UNCOOKED).

If anyone can cooks knows, pork is RED meat, when uncooked is pink/light red....
Pork only turns white when cooked.

We confronted the Chinese National stall assistant, she insisted that the minced pork balls were cooked.

The next time, hopefully when u visit this stall, cut open the minced pork balls , if they are PINKISH inside , confirm plus chop NOT cooked. Pls do NOT hesitate to ask for CHANGE of these minced pork balls!!!!!!!!!!!

Having said that, we will NO LONGER be visiting this Ah Ma Mee Sua stall @Kampong Admiralty anymore"
A must try for this hawker centre. Some may ask to exclude the pig liver if u don like the taste. I like the warm feeling when u eat there or take away. The item inside was enough. They do separate the noodle for take away. Quite heavy for just 3 pack.
"Mee sua soup was just ok, but beehoon soup was terribly plain and tasteless.
Although there's an option of $3.30 or $4.50 beehoon soup, you'll be charged $4.50 by default. Disappointing experience overall."
Avoid if u can. I used to come here often until its been taken over by rude auntie counter staff. Dont have expectations should you eat here.
"beware of random auntie hair in your food, might be useful for dna testing if yall need some test samples."
"Been more than half a year since i last ate their meesua.. The prices have gone up from $4 to $4.50.. They have lost their queue.. Last time their staffs tend to be curt, impatient when there was a queue.. Now they have become quite courteous. Haha.. Tastewise, it is still quite good, my favourite being their handmade porkballs. They are in kampung admiralty food centre. There is no aircon, but even though there are huge fans at the ceiling, my shirt is all wet w sweat after finishing the bowl of meesua .."
"Must eat quickly, otherwise Mee Sua will become mushy."
Best mee sua in town and with secret recipes the marinated minced pork. Great soup and worth to eat

"Ordered mee sua for $4.50.

Summary
Soup : average
Mee sua : average
Meat ball : good
Liver : debatable
Pork slice : poor

TL'DR
Soup was savory a bit on the salter side. Mee sua is just what u expect.

The meatballs tasted good more flavorful than the rest. Liver was quite bloody. Other wise a pretty thick cut. So it depends on whether u like your liver that way. Otherwise a pretty average liver. Pork slice are thin but there is not q to it"
"Still charging $4.50 for Ah Ma Mee Sua. A lot of ingredients, meat slice, pork balls,pig liver, egg, veggie.. worth it as the Mee Sua is also a lot. Cannot use CDC vouchers."
Dirty handling of food. Operators use bare hands to operate thw cleaning hose to clean their floor and when customer order food the same operator just put down the hose n start cooking. Using her bare hands to pick up ingredients and throw into the boiling water. U hygienic did they undergo training or simply lazy cos they are not the ones consuming the food?
"Order the ah ma mee sua since 2 thumbs up shown in the menu . Cost is reasonable $4.50.

Very yummy and lovely Makan .
Soup gravy is light and healthy less salt , generous in ingredients .

Those who looking in healthier choice . Come jio you to this stall.

Payment in cash and PayLah [QR code]hidden middle  right wall of cashier counter"
Traditional ah mah mee Sua soup is very yummy and tasting like home cooked. Fresh quality ingredients and own made meat balls.
"Nice soup. Must try again. Packed with ingredients. The bowl of mee sua soup is packed with healthy protein, minerals, vitamins, vegetables and fibres. The taste is perfect, not too salty, not too sweet. You will miss it after a while. Truly exotic food."
"This is my ultimate comfort food - Mee Sua - and Chye Lye Ah Ma Mee Sua does a great version of it. The mee sua is cooked to the right consistency, ie not mushy. The dish has added ingredients of pork liver, pork slices, two kinds of meat balls, mushroom, one medium-sized prawn and an egg cooked the way I like it - the yolk cooked on the outside but still runny on the inside. What makes this dish is the delicious soup - flavorful without being too heavy."
"Found these particles as depicted in the picture and video, went back to the stall to clarify. The lady mending the stall claimed that what I found was edible and told me all her prawns were like that."
"A hearty soup with generous amount of sliced pork, one pc of factory-made meatball, two homemade pork balls, stewed mushroom, egg and pork liver, topped with fried shredded ginger and drizzled with wine seasoning prior to serve. The soup base was flavourful, mushroom was thick and big and the smooth mee sua was nice to eat too. Egg white was fully cooked with runny yolk. Pork liver was about 80% cooked too, can request for fully cooked egg and pork liver if want. The wine can be omitted by putting request when placing order. Must try if one looking for a warm and homey noodle soup at reasonable $4/bowl."
Comfy food for rainy day. The soup was very flavorful and generous amount of noodles was given. Must go try their meat balls huge and juicy.
"Good portion and ingredients for the small bowl. Taste quite similar to Bak Chor Mee(Pork noodles).
Have pork slices, pork liver, meat balls and pork minced ball. With an egg though."
"A very nice bowl of mee sua and lots of ingredients for the place.

Highly recommended and will be back for sure."
My favourite stall for their delicious mee sua! Never fail to impress as the portion is really huge despite the price of $4. Cheap & Good! I'll have it at least twice a week (minimum). 
"Taste of home, away from home.
Chye Lye Ah Ma Mee Sua always gets its broth right, hitting the right notes with homely flavors and generous ingredients.
Apart from meesua, their shengmian noodles and Ee Mee are also very delicious."
"I had the mee sua ($4) for takeaway (container $0.30). I can understand why many people rave about this place. The soup does taste rather different from other stalls that sell mee sua. There were pork slices, liver, a meatball, and a meatball mixed with chillis, mushrooms and an egg. I did enjoy the meatball mixed with chillis, it was flavourful. I wished the liver could have been sliced more thinly."
"Very tasty, always long Q during peak hours."
"Had lunch there. Quietly told the lady manning the cashier to remind them that meat must be well cooked. She then told the person cooking it. And then I saw flies, not a lot of a couple of them.  HAWKERS SHOULD ALWAYS ENSURE PROPER FOOD HYGIENE AND PREPARATION"
"Have seen quite many reviews on this brand but I just didn't try it before. Man. Everything hits on the right spot. The soup fragrance, the mee sua that's not cooked too soft, the handmade meat ball, the pig liver, the generous portion and the very affordable price of just $4. Will be back. I will be back. Yes. I'm hardly so excited!"
"Mee Sua Soup is very nice and tasty, ingredients is fresh. Quantity is sufficient.  Price is very good for the overall.

Ee  Fu noodle soup - soup wise not as nice but ingredients is fresh and quantity sufficient"
I personally like it. Ah Ma Mee Sua.
"Comfort food, one of the better mee sua i tasted. Highly recommended if you are nearby.

The uncle/aunties are quite friendly. But sometimes they will ask u to wait for a while before they take your order so they can clear the backlogs (during peak hours)"
Best comfort food
Always my go to whenever I visit kampung admiralty. Queues are always long during lunch hour and it's very easy to see why. The mee sua is really delicious and i loved the flavour of the meat balls. Not a fan of their service (so they lose 1 star) as they do not smile or acknowledge much but it does not matter as their food delivers.
"What I like:
Ah Ma Mee Sua has some of the tastiest soup broths in Kampung Admiralty. Overall, the quality of the meal that they serve really explains the queue that forms during lunch hours.

What I dislike:
At $4, it makes for a very hearty meal. However, majority of what makes you full lies in the Mee Sua itself. Ah Ma Mee Sua feeds you full with Mee Sua just like your Ah Ma would, which is not necessarily what you want. In exchange, I tend to feel that the quantity of ingredients (meat and vegetables) that are served with the meal is limited.

Will I go back there?
Definitely yes, but I'd definitely ask them to cut down on the noodles the next time round (or maybe even share it with a partner)."
"Fresh ingredients, savory soup base. Yummy"
"Deliciously nice !!!
Need to tell chef if you do not want wine...Enjoy."
My all time favorite!! Always long queue during lunch and dinner time..but still go for it
"Very flavourful bowl of ""mee sua"" for only 4$. Remember to add ingredient and noodle and total damage is only 5$!!"
"Little should we expect much from hawker food, especially good reviews and recommendations are often given to fancy, decorative, and unique cafes and restaurants that are comfy and probably with friendly and good service too.

To this stall, I love how traditional and tasty the mee sua is. If you like soupy food, this is a must-try! Soup is rich in flavour yet not salty. Add in some cut chilli! Portion is just right for me and they give reasonable amount of meat when it cost only $4! Best to dip the meat with the black sauce; superb!

Don't expect much of a service at a hawker centre. Worker basically take your order and money, that's all; the standard. The workers there are pleasant so far.

Happy that there is food good at the this area of Singapore and I happen to live nearby (: I visit frequently simply because of the food; it's consistent no matter who's doing the cooking."
"The key is the soup! Light and yet fragrant soup with mee sua cooked just right! I don't like the salted fish pork balls though, but others said it's their favourite. Overall the soup is the star of the day. Don't expect hawkers to give you high class service! They are bunch of grumpy aunties that only focus on making the noodles! Please remember to return the finished bowl and trays to the tray return area!"
Flavourful soup with a dash of shaosing wine. Tastes like ban mian.
Sheng mian
Long queue at kampung admiralty. Standard $4. If you add $1 You add both noodles and meat
6 July. Sunday. 11 am. Tasteless coffee.  Disappointed. It used to be quite good.
"I ordered the coffee and was diluted no standard at all ! The staff was rude and i asked for extra empty cup bcos my wheelchaired bound aunty definitely cannot finish her coffee , to my surprise the lady said i have to pay 10cents for asking for extra cup and is not takeaway cup !!! She has no compassion as she saw my aunty as we were sitting infront of the shop !
Very bad service ...do not go to this stall and patronise them"
"Kopi o kosong ice - Si inoWai, Mei Wei sikatuta!"
"The kopi here is aromatic, strong, and budget-friendly, perfect for your morning pick-me-up . They also serve up local breakfast staples like kaya toast and soft-boiled eggs, which pair perfectly with their robust brew. The friendly staff and laid-back vibe make it feel just like home, and there's no better way to enjoy authentic Singaporean flavors. Highly recommended for a quick, satisfying meal or a leisurely breakfast stop! "
"Ordered both coffee kao from this Coffee Queen stall at Marine Parade hawker centre. It tasted great. The milk used is definitely not sweetener, rather more like carnation milk."
I buy Horlicks and they gave me only hot water
Best iced coffee and breakfast set in Singapore! Went to all 3 locations. 
Ordered kopi o less sugar sgd1.10 cents. Nothing special at all for queing  for around 10  person before me.
"The taste has changed for the worst at this outlet. Coffee queen coffee used to have a distinctly chocolatey taste for its kopi Peng across all its outlet. Twice this month, i tried and the taste is not what its used to be. I tried several times this month at Seah Imm that outlet still maintain."
"the other day I came here to buy coffee and I order the wrong name of the coffee instead it was ice coffee C kosong but i ordered ice teh C kosong but when I received the drink and realized I was wrong and I told the staff, surprisingly me that she accepted to change it for me with a happy attitude! thump up for the service!!! true to the name coffee queen! the coffee is delicious and the attitude is also very good!!! will come back many times and will recommend to friends"
"There were a few drink stalls in the hawker center. I chose this because it was the only stall with a queue. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the coffee. My kopi c tilok was not as concentrated as I would have liked. It was just an average cup of coffee."
"/

EXCELLENT Kopi C"
Heard it's one of the best rated coffee/tea but was disappointed. ordered the tea with milk and feel that there's was too much milk and lacked the tea taste. Quick service though but cannot compensate for the taste.
Just plain rude. Shockingly.
"A quintessential coffee shop that provides food, breakfast and beverages from morning till evening. I tried their Kaya toast, kopi C and soft boiled eggs. The quality and hygiene of the food is as expected in a hawker centre. The service is quick and the food is affordable. There is ample seating available. The stall can really improve the service quality by offering more cutlery options."
"Decent coffee, quite a large cup for the iced variant though it's $0.70 more than the hot one - but well worth every cent for the quantity I believe."
She is the sister of the owner Ms Grace and another branch at Marine Parade Hawker Centre. Very nice gesture towards guest ordering
"Ordered kopi c kosong peng. Dug out coins to pay $2.00 for the kopi, including 2 5-cent coins. Payment was rudely rejected by female Vietnamese staff. ""We don't take 5 cents here.""

I said sorry and I don't see any sign stating that. She then pointed to a dark brown wooden straw holder. It had a transparent sticker with black words on it. I won't have noticed the statement if no one pointed it out.

I proceeded to pay with a 2 dollar note and politely mentioned to the staff. ""Maybe you can ask your boss to make the display sticker more prominent then people will not miss it."" She rolled her eyes at me and turned away. Maybe it would help if she has better manners."
"Iced coffee is premixed, terrible taste. Too sweet and coffee taste is masked by the huge amount of milk and sugar added."
"Coffee so sweet that I will get diabetes just having two sips! I ordered the kopi c iced, and I got a big cup of sweetened milk with ice, no coffee taste at all. Went to ask if the stall can add more coffee into the cup but she insisted it is the coffee ideal taste and we should have ordered ICED KOPI KOSONG?? She must have not understood what KOSONG means? Never coming back again

They used to be much better, coffee taste dropped, service dropped, speed dropped"
"Wow, Kopi Peng tasted like a (melted) vanilla frappe! Great value for $1.90 if that's what you like but I found it a little too thick and sweet for my liking. Seems like they blended it instead of tarik / stirring."
Very satisfying breakfast!
"Being typical Singaporean, long queue means good right? So i queued to buy a iced milo kosong. Waiting time was reasonable, price was reasonable. The Milo WAS AMAZING. Never going to get milo from another stall again."
"Great coffee, though for Kopi C. It was on the sweet side."
"Just an average kopi-c.

I've tried this stall a couple of times, but you can get better coffee at the Marine Parade Hawker Centre."
"First time buying ice kopi C!
Not only it is potent, it is v tasty! The coffee has this chocolate aftertaste which is v special! Will recommend!"
Love their yuan yang (local coffee + local tea mixed). Do ask for less sweet as I find it just right!
"Its the long queue thats attracts me to try. Well i tried the kopi peng, and it was super good. The price was so affordable, big cup $1.90 only.. 5 stars definitely!"
"Get your coffee here!

This is a dependable coffee spot. If you're anywhere near, this is your stop for coffee. Delish coffee with milk and kaya toast. Tiny, modest coffee stall serves terrific coffee and toast and deserves number 1 of ranking in the neighbourhood."
"Ordered kopi peng and it's the pre-made kind in a flask, not freshly made. And the kopi had a siap siap slippery taste"
"Their name, coffee queen is richly deserved. Expect a queue at any time of the day but it moves quickly. My usual go-to, kopi or yuan yang is well brewed and never disappoints."
"Simple, fuss free and value for money
Hot drinks and cold drinks are usually less than $2. Cold drinks are sealed so it's hard to spill them. My kids love the cold honey lemon."
"Value set meal at $3.40 is definitely worth it, considering a cup of coffee there is already $1.20. The classic toast is crispy and the eggs are very well done (half boiled, I mean). The coffee tastes good, but can be better. Also, the staff are polite and the service is good."
Nice fragrant robust coffee with milky taste. Service is okay.
"Set meal good value, drinks are delicious"
Half boiled eggs are so raw (see picture).
Love the iced kopi. Super fragrant!
"Nice coffee, quick service."
"Disappointed by both service and food.
Service was particularly poor -- when I politely asked if there was any mayonnaise or tartar sauce to go with the tater tots (which I ordered in addition to two mains), the PRC woman simply said ""don't have"" and walked away without offering any alternative or showing basic courtesy.

For a Western food stall, not having basic condiments like mayo or tartar sauce is surprising -- it really gives off a stingy, corner-cutting vibe.

Food-wise, it didn't make up for the experience. The aglio olio that came with the mains was dry, flavourless, and completely underwhelming. Overall, wouldn't return."
"I frequent this shop about once every 2 -5 weeks. The shop is situated in a hawker centre/coffee shop, so it's considered free seating, with some dedicated tables in its area. The food is good and affordable, average $12-15/ pax. Of course, the menu features standard western fare with some italian. Would recommend the mushroom soup + garlic bread and their carbonara.

If you find yourself in the area craving some good value western food, go for it. If you want something higher end- go to an actual steakhouse instead.

Update 5/5/2025.
Food quality is mostly the same. They now have japanese styled western dishes(think famires). Their fish ans chips however, became smaller portioned. Slightly disappointed by that. Overall, still good value."
"Went last month with family. We ordered a few dishes, and they would ring the bell whenever each dish is ready. You would think this means that they cook each food one by one, but my porkchop that came first was cold. It makes me think I was served a pre made porkchop. Very disappointing. The carbonara is okay, the smoked ducked was amazing, but my experience was already ruined. At the end, as we wanted to return the plates but were given no trays, we got up, wanting to ask the counter for some trays. They instead yelled at us from behind the counter, telling us to return the plates ourselves. I understand that it is a basic courtesy to do so, but DEMANDING that your customers return the plate themselves, when you are the ones running a FnB service, is really disgusting. As we did not want any trouble, we decided to just stack the plates and returned them, leaving us with greasy hands as the plates were not wiped underneath. There was a female and a male staff behind the counter, seriously disappointing to see such low standards for this brand, when you would normally hear great things about it. Way to ruin a family dinner."
"Ordered the Signature Grilled Chicken through Grab delivery. Unfortunately, it was overcooked and charred, making it really hard to chew. It seems like it could actually taste quite good if it weren't so overdone. Hope this can be improved in the future."
"Ridiculous, self service to carry the tower of beer, who going to enjoy this?"
I love the new duck breast spaghetti! The sauce and the duck breast tastes damn good. The duck breast is with even portion of fatty portion and tastes excellent!  There are affordable pizza selections too!
Very good ambient and reasonable prices for drinks and foods.
"The waiting time is extremely long, and the kitchen is understaffed. It's also overpriced, so think twice before ordering."
"stated as 9.30pm close, arrived 9pm counter crew just tell me straight it's close"
Surprised to find this western food space in a coffee shop. Had chicken chop and chicken mushroom aglio olio. Both were great and below $10 each. I would say the food better than I had in their air conditioned restaurant. The chicken may be slighty dry though. I like their salad sauce the most. No gst no service charge.
Peaceful and quiet. Chicken baked rice really suit my taste
Was charged x2 takeaway of 60cents each for one order because they needed to use 2 containers.
Hair in the baked rice. Gross.
"Portion is quite huge.
Fried chicken chop is very well manirated, taste very good."
"New review based on latest menu after my first review 6 years ago...Awesome Spanish Pork belly and Onion rings! Reasonably priced too!

This outlet has been around for quite awhile and I have patronising quite regularly. So this is a new review based on the new menu in conjunction with the Euros. Ordered the Kickoff platter, and burgers. And happily, the quality remains deliciously ups and still value for money. The kickoff platter is basically a mix grilled and fried fish set. Meats are nicely executed, tender and nicely chatted. Breaded fish is firm, moist and crispy. Swapped the fries for salads. Burgers are delish too. Will definitely go back for this platter before the Euro ends.

They have a special section of the Kopitiam for themselves. However this spot could do with more fans. It's quite warm due to the heat from the grills and can be better ventilated."
"Came here for dinner, and I have to say, it is quite comparable to Collin's.
Common grill is like the more affordable version of Collin's. I order the grilled chicken chop, which was their signature. Personally, I don't really like the aglio olio, hence I order fries as the pasta is not spicy enough.
Their pizza is also very nice, and somehow, the teriyaki chicken pizza is actually not bad!
If you are craving for western, this is the place to go to, especially when you have a budget."
"Promotion: $16.50 per plate of Angus beef plus spaghetti set. Though the Angus beef isn't that fresh (thus the promo price ), pepper sauce added bring in some taste thougg. Auntie serving fast and friendly."
"04.06.2024 - my friends and I are craving for western food and we came to this stall, we were standing at the counter for 3 mins, the staff didn't bother to come and ask us what do we want to order, what a bad services... A male staff was doing some accounting and the female staff was eating, we looked to the male staff and called out to him coz he was sitting near the counter. He gave me a fierce stare for a second, didn't say a bloody word and looked away.
I should say, MINUS ZERO STAR FOR THE STALL.
WE will not go again."
No body at counter Open for what? call the staff he look at u and said nothing. Then look away. Wahh Number 1 Service
"Went to this place around 1.15 today. Stand at the counter waited to be served. 2 staff was sitting at separate tables. A male staff was doing some accounting, the female staff was eating if my memory serves me right. I looked to the male staff and called out to him coz he was sitted closest to the counter and didnt want to bother the female staff coz she was eating. He gave me a fierce stare for a second, didn't say a bloody word and looked away continueing his what looks to be some simple accounting.

I presume they should be open coz I saw a table of 4 guys eating.

IF U DONT BLOODY WANT TO SERVE LUNCH. PLEASE PUT A CLOSED SIGN TELLING PEOPLE THAT!

ITS MY FIRST TIME COMOMG TO THIS PLACE AND ITS MY FREAKING LAST !"
Truffle mushroom pizza was not bad. The crust was quite dense and a little tough. The truffle and tomato base stands out. Mushroom were thick cut. Yummy!
"Counter cashier auntie fast with otdering n knows the menu well.
Taste ok but ingredient is so so.
small outlet with limited tables.
not sure if ok to take food eat at next door hawker center.
no aircon just two swivel fans at ceiling corner."
"Barely tried the Truffle Alfredo for $11.50, the more expensive pasta of the bunch. It was a symphony of salt. Every bite tickles your throat, threatening to send you to the hospital. Im glad I waited here for my appointment at Woodlands Polyclinic because I can follow up my doctor for this health hazard.

Cheap mushrooms, cheap minced pork(supposed to be bacon), undercooked pasta, subpar and unfriendly service. Surprised its rated this highly."
Food was good but price a bit expensive
"The food quality was improved compare to the past. They change the menu occasionally, this is plus point, nearby resident won't get bored with the same food."
Food is cheaper then collins itself. Taste good as well.
"The food was very yummy, but they did not provide much service and the atmosphere is very relaxing."
"The place was not busy but the service staff have Super bad attitude.  Waited for a long time and thought to ask how long would my take away food be since it's not busy and it's a open concept where you can see what they are doing in the kitchen. Not cooking at all but preparing other raw food. when ask the so call chef refused to answer and walked away, started to cooked my pasta and dump it into the take away box. Super rude."
"Long wait time.for takeaway when there was no.Q
Furthermore the staff are general not repomsive"
"The Fish and Chip was tasty and value for money.
You have to come eat yourself to know.."
Good western food and affordable.
"Pork chop and iberico pork sausage aglio olio.  5/5

Food is great!  Pork is tender, not dry and overcooked.

Hard to find western hawker stall serving tasty food and selling pork now. Cherish them!"
"placed a self pick up on grab food. I must say this is the worst western cuisine I have ever tasted, first of all the pork ribs definitely came straight out of the microwave, it was so ***** tough and dry that it's inedible. Secondly, I don't know what the **** they put on their chicken chop but it's just so bitter, even their black pepper sauce is bitter. My partner got the fish n chip and wow it was so tasteless and likewise to the pork ribs it's dry as ****. One last thing, their mash potato is absolutely bad, I don't know what they put in the mash potato but it just taste so sticky like wow how does one even screw up mash potato. I must say out of everything I ate the only nice thing was the corn. Also, on grabfood it's much cheaper but never would I order from them again. Worst experience I ever had everything was just so bad."
Wonderful food
Not like before.  Mean quality drop.  bye
Would definitely recommend their PIZZA! Overall portion is huge. Worth the price I would say 
Seamless ordering & generous portion of food
Food portion was big. Taste was ok. But like the pizza & fries the most.
The food is quite nice
"The staff prepare the takeaway order first and left dining in customers to wait for over an hour. Food was not cooked well and the staff attitude was horrendous.
Will never ever come here ever again"
(306 woodlands) Chef adjusted my order to my request. Was good. Thank you.
Nice place to have a steak and salad. Not many choices due to shop size. They do it well and not too pricey. You can also order beverage or beer from the next door coffee stall.
Food is good .
Extremely bad service by female cashier.
"Fantastic dinner at Common Grill by Collins, the soup is marvellously done, I had the bangers and mash, the sausages were cooked nicely and the mash potatoes were so great! Comes with a fancy side of simple salad with dressing."
"Food is okay, had the steak here a few times, has been getting thinner and smaller. Reasonable for coffeeshop Western. However, the service staff were not wearing their masks, while handling food. The lady manning the counter, also not wearing her mask, was also incredibly rude. Despite forgetting to prepare the tomato soup we ordered, she told her colleague that our order was so troublesome with so many requests (we previously asked for a receipt and 2 extra small plates), and that she didn't want to work anymore right infront of me in Mandarin. The other male staff who assisted me instead was nice and understanding, but also maskless. Hygiene and food handling standards should still be followed despite a relaxation of rules."
Went to Common Grill By Collin's at 306 Woodlands! The food was so good. Chicken was tender and the fries portion was really huge for $4! Tried the sweet potato fries and normal fries with cheese and mayo dip. Ordered their Signature Grilled Chicken Chop served with Aglio Olio and Grilled Fish Fillet! Totally worth the price and will definitely come back.
staff are curt. food is bland. fries are quite good tho. will never eat there again.
Portion of food has obviously shrunken & the taste has also gone down.
"So long didn't come here, menu all change , Ordered a ribeye but 20% is tendons, Corn also very cheap type, not sweet no taste. Overall  Standard drop alot alot"
Just pass by
The portion is generous. Test good also. Recommended!

"Food quality is good.
Generally tastes better than it looks.
Chicken chop is well-seasoned and slightly charred outside while still tender inside.
Portions are big though, may want to share with someone if you're not particularly hungry"
"I used to like their customizable menu, but no more. And the song choice is loud and unpleasant to me. The food is still good overall though.... except the salad, it's like they cut corners. I miss the old Common Grill."
Friendly service and waiting time not that long
Bought a discounted voucher for Chicken Aglio at $6.90 on Shopback. Food was good and portion is just right. However the leather sofa is peeling and looks dirty and unslightly. So i sat on the chair. Good food at reasonably price within a HDB estate. COMMON GRILL IS PART OF CHEF COLLIN'S RESTAURANT.  MUST TRY.
"@commongrillbycollins , please check on the quality of your food at your branches? Do you allow for precooked food to be served to your customers?

Either way, when your customer makes a review with photos, don't ask for more photos and what is the point of asking for the receipt?

How does it change anything? If you have bad practices and serve bad food, no amount of pictures or a receipt can change that fact. Just apologise and review your systems."
I ordered Katsu Curry rice take away on 8/10 but realized that is no curry at all. Possible to have a refund?
Value for money. 8 dollars for a nice cabonara with huge serving.
"Ordered a number of combos and sets for Father's Day dinner via foodpanda. Our delivery was delayed, so I had to make a call to their outlet during peak hour. Just wanted to give a big shoutout to the person who picked up the phone (presumably the line manager?) at around 6.10pm on 20 June 2021! They were very professional and transparent, and explained that while it was peak hour for them, our food was already prepared and waiting to be picked up. (I guess hearing that our food was already prepared was a bonus ) Enjoyed our food immensely, too!

(Order included 1x COLLIN'S(r) Sharing Platter , 1x Combo F - Carbonara With Chicken Cutlet , 1x Signature Grilled Chicken Chop With Tender Lamb Chop , 1x Combo B - Mixed Grill)"
I love the tempura squid tentacle.
Been to a few common grill restaurant but the portion here is a bit small. But still enjoy the food.
"Enjoyed the salmon set, reasonable price, and many side order options."
"Great place in Marsiling for a quick fix of western food if you crave it in the midst of walking around the hawkers in the area. A main dish (I picked salmon) with 3 sides (fries, grilled tomatoes, lettuce) costs SGD 12. You get to pick a sauce (mango is great!) to go with your main dish."
"The beer battered onion rings literally swimming in oil.... your fryer not hot enough or you never let the oil drip.

I can literally SOAK 1 tissue paper in oil from just 1 large ring.

4 pieces of tissue, still haven't finish eating."
Regular place for a Simple Steak Meal and Fish is Good!
"First time trying. Dishes are above average size. Food is okay. Counter service however is wanting - Not allowed to order more than 1 main at a time (You have to order mains and sides 1st before proceeding to subsequent order of mains). Receipt is also not automatically given unless requested. Overall while food is acceptable, service is below industry standards. For the price range better dining experience could be had at similar establishments (eg. Aston's, Hot tomato).
Perhaps a saving grace was that they were alert to spot they had missed out an item for my orders when my buzzer rang for collection."
Local Western Food
Fish was over cooked and pasta was also hard in texture. Disappointed with quality after trying for first time. Over rated is the conclusion.
"1st time there, food quality was alright. My friend told me it was better when he visited earlier."
"Black Angus sirloin medium rare a bit overcooked, but still tender. Sides are good and of great variety. Portion big enough for two kids. Will plan for next visit."
Good food at reasonable price
"Bad experience! Was excited to try out because of good ratings and interesting concept. However, when the food came (during peak hour), was surprised that nothing on the plate was warm. Everything was cold?! Even the meat... Disappointing... and it's not like the waiting time was short since it's peak dinnertime on a weekend. Utensils were also dirty so we had to pick out new ones. Was planning to bring friends and family if nice but no way..."
Very bad payment methods.
The food is good and generous portion
"Crowded, looks popular with the residents here. Good fare, good portions.."
Prefer his chicken chop than this pork chop
"I love eating common grill here in my area, the food is nice and affordable, staff are very friendly and very accomodating. Its part of our every week dinner with friends.. keep it up!"
Delicious western meal in the woodlands heartland! Nice chicken chop and smoke duck with 3 sides! Flavourful and affordable!
Nice place. Can use the seats of the coffeeshop beside it. Food has been good so far
The pork belly is freaking awesome!
I ordered the ribeye middle rare  and I wouldn't recommend it. It was a thin slab of meat which was fine because its only $19. My only problem is they couldn't get it right after 2 attempts; the meat in 2nd attempt looks stale. Perhaps the safer items like chicken and pork would be a better choice here
Great Western Food hidden inside the neighbourhood coffee shop. The price is reasonable and food is up to our expectation. Give it a try!!!
"Love the lamb chop. Their sides are good, especially the roasted sweet potatoes."
Not very Friendly stall
Although price has increased over the years and varieties of the food has changed. They still managed to uphold some of their signature. Their chicken worsen but their beef was awesome. The pasta and side dishes were the best for me. Love their new sweet potato fries. Hope they can improve their other mains and have other side dishes available.
Always never get their steak doneness right
Good food. Good ambience despite located at a coffee shop.
Very slow to do orders
Great value
"Great food. Third time ordering from here now since the circuit breaker started. Love the chicken chop, hammock fish, and short ribs. Pasta, salad and soup is great too. Prices are just affordable due to 50% promotion on Grabfood ($14~15 per set after discount). Will definitely continuing ordering from here should the promotion continues (too expensive otherwise). Would recommend."
A part of chicken chop is raw!!! It's disgusting!!!
"The carbonara has onions inside, that tasted quite raw. No bacon taste, and too creamy. If visiting again, will not order it again."
"It's fine that the staff is not friendly but please at least, don't be rude. Whether dinning in or takeaway, the staff are just so rude as if I went there for free meals. From now on, no business from me."
Meat quality is poor. Price slightly high.
"Long time no order my all time favorite grilled meat from Common Grill, but today is disappointed for the fried fish haddock + chicken chop set. Change of packaging, with the cover lid not able to close properly and caused the fried fish haddock drop out. But biggest disappointment is the chicken chop some of the part are not well cook. Can see some meat redness. Maybe is rushing for order, but food safety should be priority. Poultry meat shall cook fully well."
Tried the signature chicken chop with black pepper sauce.Taste is ok but not fantastic.The eggplant is overcooked n super oily.Sweet potato fries is ok.Overall I'm quite disappointed.The price is too high side for a neighborhood restaurant without aircon($9.5).There is hawker western food(e.g western food at Taman Jurong hawker lv3) that is much cheapere price and more delicious than this Common Grill.
"Really enjoyed all the dishes I have taken out from here so far. The ribeye steaks are a good balance of meat and fat and the chicken is juicy and flavourful. The only item I feel needs some improvement is the ribs which can do with a bit more flavour.

The menu is simple to understand, just order 1 protein, which comes with 1 carbo (rice, pasta or potato) and 2 sides (veg or egg!). For takeaway, the food is packed in a box with separate compartments.

Definitely worth another visit."
"The fish was a little too dry for my liking. Price is a bit high for coffeeshop fare but considered decent since it's collins. The sweet potato fries was good, even better than what I remember collin sweet potato fries to be because it's skinnier although it felt lukewarm which minus some points. Also like that we can mix & match and choose our sides and vegetables but tough for decision making because I want some of everything!! Also find the serving to be slightly small. However, they have a membership that seems to be pretty worthwhile so might consider getting that for a return visit."
"Best Western food at the cheapest price.
Love the meal sets.
Try the Bratwurst and Pork Chop"
Food is nice n reasonable price but it's better to sit outside due to bad ventilation
"Great food and good portions. A little expensive for a coffee shop but you could forgive that for the portion size.

If only the counter staff smiles a little more."
"Place was clean, neat and tidy. Variety of meat which you can pick and choose the meat, sides, sauce to customise your meal."
Great large portion of nice delicious Western style food that is value for money inside a kopitiam within a matured housing estate.
"Best value around. Tasty food,  generous portions and beautifully served."
Great place
Nice coffee and cosy place for chatting.
Where else to get good western on the borders? Maybe cross to JB?
Very good value for money.
Love the food here
Great quality better than Astons!
The combo meals are great value for money!
Price is in the higher range for some dishes. Food portion is huge though
"Located next to the woodlands polyclinic, food was great for its price, menu was simple but had alot of options and had great decor and amatmosphere will highly recommend everyone to try"
Have been happy with their food and friendly service so far.
"Newly renovated.
Haddock fillet meal very good deal@$10 only!(sorry, latest update: $12 on 13th Jul 2019)
Thick & solid unlike others.
Try their sweet potato fries, unique.
62 degrees egg is very kinda Japan style."
"Not Great anymore

1. 11am not even open. ( if cannot start selling dont put 11am waste my time waiting )

2. 62 degree egg, more like 26 degree egg its cold.

3. Egg cold, and the york broke.

The meat was good, the side need to improve."
Like the food there
"Great food at good prices. Never had a bad meal here. One minor downside is non-airconditioned - it's in a kopitiam afterall. And also that they don't sell drinks, gotta get across the partition to the regular kopitiam side to get your drinks."
"Food was of good quality, big portions were given with affordable prices! I particularly enjoyed the sweet potato fries, potato sidewinches and pork ribs."
"Serve good size and tasty Western food. Price economical, values for money."
Chicken cutlet was overcooked and too dry
Great taste with affordable price
Good food at a good price.
"Mei You Leng Qi,Dan Jia Ge Suan Shi Hui,Yi Da Li Mian Hao Chi,Dan Niu Rou Shao Wei Guo Shou Liao Yi Dian"
"Cheap, nice and worth for price."
Affordable and taste really nice.  The way they let you choose your sides are amazing. Plus all the side dishes you could order in a group? Fabulous.
Different menu from collins @ marina square. less pricey but still maintain the standard.
Different stall taste slightly different.
"A good restaurant experience based in the coffee shop of the neighborhood, this place offers a good choice of foods"
Not my type of food
"Good food, good price. Nice setting."
This place serves amazing western food and offers extensive and great customisation. I liked the concept of choosing proteins and then adding carbs to go with it. I personally love the jumbo prawns with Italian herb sauce
"11 dollars for 2 pieces of pork chop with 2 side is quite reasonable. Tasted quite good, onlyBroccoli tasted a little off.
A good place to hang out with a group of friends without busting your wallet."
"They have improved menu, good deal for meal. Taste and food presentation is as good as restaurant standards."
"Not for who must have air-con. Western foods - good tastes, reasonable pricing,  self-order and pay at counter."
Big portion for decent price
food is a little pricey for it's location but it's worth every dollar paid. ordered pork belly. portion was around 6 to 7 dollars worth of Shao Rou. and it's so tender and flavourful. 11 dollars for that with 3 sides. only thing lacking is air con. too warm.
Food delicious and cheaper.
Food damn delicious but cashier damn rude.
Only beef very nice....
"Revamp menu. Overall dinning experience is good. Food presentation is great and taste is quite good too. Prices are affordable compared to the high end outlet.
Definitely worth a visit."
"Great food, ordered grilled chicken (with 3 sides, one carb, 2 veggies/ egg) for $9. Definitely value for money, aglio olio was well cook and flavoured, chicken was tender and 62 degrees egg was a nice addition to the meal!"
Price is right with the portion given
Good grilled meats at reasonable prices.
"Horrendous customer service at Northpoint Outlet. Their outlet manager , a guy called Charles, his attitude sucks big time, with a sarcastic, defiant, weird sneaky demeanor that is totally unbecoming of a service staff. Another China Chinese female staff also has a poor and rude attitude, who seems to learn from her manager. The atmosphere is highly toxic, all seems to cause by their manager.  I have already lodged an official complaint to their HQ for their reply. I hope a proper corrective/preventive action would be taken to address the issue at Northpoint outlet.  However, I would like to commend on the excellent service provided by the Cineleisure outlet Manager Mr. Darren last Saturday, who did a service recovery after my bad experience at Northpoint outlet. This are the kind of proper service manager talents that Collin's should attract."
Nice n cheap food
"Newly renovated, menu changed. Come try!"
"Excellent restaurant quality food in a low key setting. Generous portions, and lots of variety. High value for money"
"Very bad customer service in northpoint Collin Grille.
Need a lot of improvement!"
"Quite good western food, prices are reasonable and the portion given is really filling."
Just renovated with excellent food.
I will give 5-stars for the quality of the food servings.
Best Western Cuisine around Marsiling!
Standard Drop
"Nice tasty, well cooked, speedy service."
"If you wanna get some quality collin's, it's probably better if you head to Ang Mo Kio outlet"
The steak was at most average. The soup feels instant and tasteless
Average food. Value for money though
"Always eat this whenever I go to the coffee shop, food is not bad and price is also reasonable for a western store."
"Good place for quick office lunch. At the same rime, a lot of quality options to choose from. I love seafood and the many choices of salmon they offer. My usual is the salmon with the mango sauce (W26?) . Heavenly! ANd only for $9.90"
Good and relatively cheap western food!
Exciting grills! Tender steaks with cosy romantic ambience. Friendly fast clean tidy classy deco for comfortable lunch high tea and dinner.
Great selection of food.
Ample serving and good taste. A little ex for a hawker/food stall though.
offers very good taste western food with only cheap price
"Food is so disappointing. I ordered Beef Bolognaise and my friend ordered Carbonara. Both tasted heavily of soy sauce and a bit too salty for my liking. The beef balls are obviously textured vegetable protein. I can't even taste the tomato in the sauce. Considering that their food is more expensive than the neighboring stalls, you'd expect more; that's just not the case."
How many damn times do you need to see a PayLah payment? This is beyond ridiculous. Get a proper device that actually confirms payments instead of harassing your customers to prove it over and over again!
First and last.  Extremely harsh kopi sew tai
"Bought Lemon Barley @ Marine Parade Central Hawker Central. Short hair lady (non local) was unfriendly and ignored request for 'less ice' for my lemon barley. Either she don't understand simple English or she just don't accept special request. As it turns out, the drink taste nothing of barley but simply, a lemon drink that has zero sweetness. Regretted ordering from this store, I'll order drinks from the stall next to them for sure in future. To post this review, I've to give 1 star. Honestly, this stall deserve non at all imo."
Creamy egg and excellent aromatic coffee
"The eggs were good, but the toast was pretty normal"
It's a slightly more modern coffee stall offering traditional fare. The butter kaya bun was especially nice.
"The coffee c losing $1.30 is really good for me

IMO, it is even better than Toast Box coffee which is one of my go-to"
"I was in queue for over 10mins even though I was first in line. The shop assistant just told me I have to wait. However when a Vietnamese customer walked to the stall, the shop served her order right away. I am speechless.

When they finally took my takeaway order - teh-o-iced and kopi-c-siew-dai, they gave me a teh-o-kosong which I discovered in time, thereby repeating my orders for a 3rd time. I had repeatedly said I wanted the kopi tied up but they served it to me in a takeaway cup.

I walked away, can't be bothered to change it. To my horror the kopi spilled every where. Creating a huge mess on the bus. Spilled all over my hands and phone. Never going back to this stall"
Just 4 words.. RUDE staff... WORST coffee...
The most tasty and cost effective kopi c in Singapore.
"Extremely rude service lady. Ordered egg sandwich set, she wanted to charge 0.30 for an additional small plate for sharing with my son, not even the take away plate, just a normal plate. Then I went to order some other food, 3 min later came back and tasted the drink, realised she make kopi instead of tea, which I ordered. I told her about the wrong order, she gave super black face and kept complaining that I didn't tell her earlier - which is absurd because she was the one made wrong order in the first place ! Crazy to blame on customer for not realising soon enough - what differently would she do if I told her earlier ? Gave it to someone else after I took a sip ? Horrible service, can't imagine how miserable one's life is in order to be this grumpy and stingy."
"Beware of cheating stall trying to lower cost by using artificial sweetener/creamer to substitute for evaporated milk! Am a daily Teh C Peng drinker. First time ordering at this stall and lady immediately reached into the fridge to pour from a big flask of pre-made ""teh"". Took a sip and immediately taste was off - tasted exactly like bubble tea with artificial sweeteners! I tried asking for a refund or at least make another fresh cup but another lady comes in acting rowdy, creating a scene and acting like she didn't understand what I was saying. Just went ahead to purchase teh c peng from another stall, came back and showed her to prove my point that her ""Teh C Peng"" is not what it is! Picture of rowdy lady with my cup (green straw) returned. Very next picture was cup bought at another stall."
Haven't got an order correct yet in 3 tries. Says I ordered wrong even if I've paid for the right item. Very slow.
"I am a huge fan of vietnamese coffee. Visit popular vietnamese restaurants like Co Hai Banh Mi & Pho Vietnamese Restaurant and Long Phung, but all their coffee was mediocre and boring.

Unlike this i had a Creative Coffee & Toast. I was having my lunch at the hawker center and was looking for a promising looking drink stall to purchase my regular kopi. When I walked past Creative coffee and toast, I was greeted by a vietnamese lady. I knew she was vietnamese instantly as their accent is so recognizable and pleasing to hear. I told her I was just looking around and I might be back later. After wandering around and looking at all the boring thin coffees made by the fellow uncle and aunties, I decided to head back to Creative coffee and toast to try my luck.  I had zero expectation before ordering and was really praying for a good cup of coffee. To my surprise, it tasted very similar to the one I had in vietnam! it was 80% close, the missing 15% was that it was not thick as vietnam and 5% was due to the fact that they didnt provide a small glass of tea which is commonly done in vietnam. BUT OVERALL I WAS STILL SUPER SATISFIED.

Their coffee has a roasted caramel note to it. It really different from any coffee you find in Yakun, toast box, starbuck (ewwww), and others. I am very curious to find out what gives their coffee that distinct flavor profile which replicate what is served in vietnam.

They have 2 other outlets near bukit timah, I will go down and visit. Fingers crossed that the coffee is as good!"
"Service was poor, staff spoke to me really curtly and I waited 20 mins for my banh mi + drink.

This was also the worst banh mi I've eaten with very little ingredients inside. I also ordered Set 5 ($6) which was Roasted Chicken but I got Pork Ham instead.

I saw many people get the drinks only. Do not recommend the banh mi at all."
Butter Kayak Bun was $1.70. I waited for it a couple of minutes and came out warm at perfect temperature. It's flavor was as good as described online. The staff is very friendly. Loved it.
"Garlic Rich Crispy Bread , I love it "
"Nice teh-c & Kopi-c. Sweet owner.

Happy to add some extra sugar for the Kopi-c, and the best coffee in this hawker Center."
"Above average nasi lemak. Sayur lodeh was nicely lemak, chicken wings are dry outside,  moist inside. Sambal a bit bland though."
"Came here with colleagues for lunch as it was only a few stations away from my workplace. I would never have thought to explore this place because it is so far from where I'm staying.

Anyway, I googled and found that this stall was listed as one of the must-try foods when coming to this hawker centre. It's an a la carte style Nasi Lemak. You can choose your toppings. The menu shows the price for each topping. Other than the rice, I added what usually makes up a nasi lemak - fried egg, nuts, ikan bilis, fried chicken wing and a sambal fishcake. I paid about $5+ in total.

In terms of taste, the rice was warm, fragrant and savory. The fried chicken wing and ikan bilis were crispy and not too salty. The umami from the sambal just tied everything together. It wasn't too spicy or sweet and the right amount of 'garing'. I really enjoyed this dish very much. Would definitely recommend others to try."
"Best thing about the plate is probably the rice - really flavourful and gives off the coconut taste, stands out among the other ingredients for sure."
"Really enjoyed the nasi lemak here! The chicken wing was perfectly cooked, and adding the curry veg was a great choice. The rice, with their chili and ikan bilis, truly makes it one of the better nasi lemaks I've had. Plus, the staff were super nice and friendly, which is a pleasant surprise compared to many hawker stalls! Paid $6"
On my list for a long time. Not bad but not spectacular. Chilli sambal tasty but I prefer slight sweeter
"Travelled to Marine Parade on a whim after leaving the east side for nearly 20 years. Decided to try this nasi lemak for breakfast after an on the spot reading of a few random food reviews of the hawker centre. The stall has no fixed set menu, but the friendly uncle was happy to recommend the chicken wing and the bergedil. The cost should be around 5+, but my plate cost $6+ due to the extra bergedil requested by my Mrs  . The rice has a strong fragrance of coconut and the sambal chilli is pretty good. The chicken wings and bergedil were great too. Worth a try!"
"Back then, I'm always excited at Marine Parade Central Hawker Centre, but not now. My childhood muslim food vendor has gone. Today, I have decided to queue for a nasi lemak stall. The long queue seems to be a stabiliser to me. There is no set meal available, my plate with a wing, a small pathetic sambal cuttlefish, 2 bagedill, and a sunny side up, pack with a large scoop of thick sambal chilli. There is some ikan bilis, and the damage is $10/- for the plate. I believe you would pay if the food is good but it isn't worth the price. Rice is fine but still lacks umami. The wing is dry and over fried. Cuttlefish is also overcooked and lose the biting texture, and I wonder why they cut it halfway. Sambal is not what I preferred. Overall, in the hard-core nasi lemak arena here, they don't stand out at all, in my opinion."
"One of the better nasi lemak this part of East side
Rice is fluffy and flavorful - santan is bursting in your mouth
Chicken wing - not overly seasoned
Ikan bilis and nuts - good, not overfried
Sambal chili - nicely balanced; spice and sweetness from the onions

Worth the trip here

The uncle has been here for 30+ years, recent years stall has expanded to D'authentic Mee Rebus 2 stalls down"
"Before noon ... left chicken wings , ikan billis , egg and tofu? Am I too late or too early for this stall?  $5.90 for a dry not well marinated chicken wing , nice crispy ikan billis ordinary fried egg , acceptable fragrant rice , super sweet chilli . Friendly service. . Maybe they were good once upon a time.
Second visit early morning at 8 everything was fresh n hot . Try the lontong added extra fresh fried beadcurd and begedil with chilli . The taste was awesome . The vegetable curry was rich n flavourful blend with the chilli was an enhance to the dish."
This plate of nasi lemak cost $4.40. The rice is full of fragrance and tasty. The fish cake is soft and the bagedil is ok. The sambal is sweet and not so spicy. Will I eat this again? Not in my visit again list.
"Standard has dropped. Nasi lemak rice was hard and undercooked. Sayur lodeh lacked the ""lemak"" aroma."
"Bought 2 boxes of Nasi Lemak with chicken wing, begedil and ikan bilis for $10.20. Food taste is great with the chilli. I'm surprised with the large serving of ikan bilis and peanuts. Price is reasonable compared to what I usually got from a Malay stall in Marine Terrace coffee shop."
Can taste the flavour of the authentic coconut milk infused in the rice when you take the first bite.
The lontong is superb. Nasi lemak abit pricey but worth it . Extremely friendly staff. The sambal sotong is the bomb.
"Fragrant rice, chicken wings are crispy and sambol is good. A little on the pricey side but worth it."
"$8. Pricier than I expected from a hawker store.
Fragrant rice though!"
Marine Parade Hawker centre next to Parkway Parade
The rice and the sambal are excellent. These are the two most important elements in nasi lemak and this shop has it down to perfection.
"Food as pictured was just below $6 SGD. Chicken wing was very crunchy. Chilli was sweeter side and not super spicy, which goes well with the rice. Ikan bilis is very crispy if that's what you like. Goes great with the chilli and nasi lemak.

I'd go out on a limb to say that the nasi leak has dropped slightly from it's mind-blowing deliciousness that I remember about 5 years ago. But it is still a great place to eat nasi lemak if you are nearby. They sell out by early afternoon so be sure to stop by in the morning."
Uncle and stall assistants are very friendly. The food is sedap!
"Dined in at lunch hour on Sat 3/2.

The rice was fluffy and quite fragrant, the chicken wing was served hot and fried just right and tasty. Overall, would say they serve a very competent version of nasi Lemak here.

Like others have said, a little pricier than usual/ as expected for hawker centre.

My other gripe is the service is a bit slow, in terms of plating and completing orders, and also takes a while when the pakcik punches his calculator to count the price to pay."
"2 crispy wings, fragrant rice, peanuts, 2 big slices of cucumber and spicy sambal $6. So far this is the only descent stall I am likely to go back in MP hawker."
Chicken wing was ordinary. Maybe less than ordinary but the rice was super fragrant. Everything else can give it a miss.
Best Nasi Lemak I've had in a long time. Can't complain about the price coz it's worth it. So have it at least once every week or so.
"Very standard crispy fried chicken wing, very good crispy ikan bilis and nuts. Very al dente and fluffy fragrant rice. Generous amount of very dry sambal chilli, quite spicy, not too sweet, decent. Didn't like the extremely overfried egg that turned ""plasticky"" underneath. Overall quite ok."
"Quite delicious Nasi Lemak, so I kept coming back for the same combo. A little pricy at $6.80 but super tasty! The rice is fragrant and rich in coconut milk, super like!"
Sambal jangan lokek.
"D'Authentic Mee Rebus is two stalls away from Nasi Lemak. It is served with one whole egg.
Overall, everything is yummy and perfect."
"I tried their mee rebus two stalls down from nasi lemak location, and this is one of the better versions I've had.  The sauce was absolutely spot on and so good, that I didn't leave a drop behind"
No set so you can choose dishes to be in your basic ikan bilis and egg nasi lemak. Sambal is thick. Crunchy ikan bilis and peanuts.
Nice and friendly stall owner Uncle. Food is delicious and fresh. Highly recommended. :)
"My personal opinion..
The food is nice&tasty and worth the money. The seller is very kind and friendly.
Highly recommended to try."
"I used to have this Nasi lemak before renovation and I thought it's nice and decently priced.

Price of this Nasi lemak set is at $5.60.

It's pretty pricey for this in a heartland hawker center. As you can see from the photo, chicken wing is pretty dry.
There are better ones out there."
Very good lontong!  Haven't had one for a long time and glad I did. Sayur lodeh is well cooked and tasty!
Excellent Nasi Lamak!
"The friendly boss is a foodie himself who gladly teaches you how to pair your Lontong with chicken wing, anchovies and mashed potato. Nice leh!"
I'm very thankful and grateful to the owner for not letting me pay for the food. He saw that I have a fractured leg and injury he just refused to take my payment. Thank you for your compassion and God blessed them.
"Has a chicken wing + bergedil over rice. Can taste the slight aroma of the coconut in the rice. $3.50.

Chicken wing and bergedil was ok. Not memorable. My batch of rice is on the mushy side. Good for those that like soft rice."
"Rice is fragrant but it's pricey because the stall charges for each ingredient separately. Overall, just a mediocre plate of nasi lemak and there are so many other options that are more value for money."
Very very good nasi lemak
The best Nasi Lemak in Marine Parade. Food is fresh and price is right.
biggest double thumbs upVery affordable pricemany varieties of fresh food to choose fromvery long queue & fully crowded
Nice nasi lemak and lontong. Friendly service. Both came to $9.60.
They wanted to serve good quality to their customers even have to wait for a few minutes. The queue is long.
"Fragrant lemak rice, crispy ikan bilis and chicken wing! Nice! Sambal isn't too spicy, goes well with the rice :)"
"I shared a plate with friends. The rice is fragrant and ""lemak"" enough. The sambal is also nice. Worth a return for a thorough review.

#updated review - 2 months later#
The nasi lemak is still good. I added fried chicken wing and sotong."
"Best Nasi lamak at Marine Parade food center, especially the steam  & chill is the highlight of the whole meal  must try when you are in the east side.  cannot miss it!!"
Good nasi lemak. I like the rice. A bit stingy with the sambal. But overall good
A lovely owner with delicious nasi lemak.
"If you're used to Malaysian nasi lemak, this is going to taste underwhelming in comparison.

While the rice was nice, everything else was average including the sotong and brinjal. Even paid extra for peanuts, ikan bilis and cucumber which are non-negotiables when it comes to nasi lemak, surprised I had to ask for this to be included. Paid $7 in total which includes a fried egg, on the pricier side for a hawker meal."
"Pulut nasi lemak, can eat on its own, though a bit dry. Sambal taste stronger"
Various types delicious foods to choose.
"Really tasty, with fragrant coconut rice. The stall owner is also very friendly too!"
One of my favourites nasi lemak but prices had inflated quite a fair bit .... (Covid ?)
"Nice fragrant nasi, very lemak. Coconutty rice is worth a try. Sambal has some kick to it, sweet and some fiery spice. Chicken wing is crispy and tasty."
"Ordered the standard nasi lemak set for takeaway but for $5.00, it's a tag pricey!

$5.00 standard nasi lemak set includes the usual 1 egg, ikan bilis with peanuts, rice and 1 chicken wing + 1 fish cake. Sambal chilli is not spicy and abit sweet for my liking... !

Check price first before you ordered! Most expensive Nasi Lemak in hawker centre. Food ok only but not worth to pay so much! Stingy on chilli(sambal)! Only gave two tiny drops when asked for more! Nasi Lemak without sambal!!!
Came here for the rendang chicken which you seldom see as a choice for nasi lemak in SG unlike in Malaysia. Unfortunately it was sold out and I had to settle for the standard chicken wing which was so so. I like the Tau Kwa though which is also rare. Also the Ikan bilis is crispy without being hard.
Have been a frequent customer for sometime! Nasi lemak was one of the best I've tasted! Thank u uncle also for the kind act! Wish you well!
Very delicious nasi lemak sold by a very friendly family! Highly recommended.
"Remembered this old stall nasi lemak, phase 2 does not allow patrons to sit round to dine.
You got to bring your lunch boxes to pack them home."
"Quite a tasty plate of nasi lemak. First time trying it out after someone recommended it and was really pleased. It's on the slightly pricier side compared to  other nasi lemak stores but the portion sizes are generous. Took the fried ikan bilis, fried egg, veg and chicken wing and almost couldn't finish what was given."
Cheap and good nasi lemak. Fried chicken good
"This is ordinary taste yet so pricy ... ikan bilis $1!!! Rice $1!!! Like 1/2 bowl so little -Vegetables like can count $1...Super overrated- the plate is $4.50 with a single chicken wing... Unbelievable!
We went there as review mentioned standard nasi lemak $3.50 with fish, egg, ikan bilis, chicken wings... no such thing!!! Super misleading and shocking !"
"Taste was ok, something I would expect for a normal plate of Nasi Lemak."
Very nice nasi lemak. Chicken wing is also great...
Authentic Nasi lemak. I've been eating here since I was a kid and it has never failed me once. Grateful to be able to eat such quality food!
"It is OK, not as tasty i remember it to be."

Taste good
"Well.  Too expensive if you get the small piece of redang chicken..

Almost $7 when I just want a simple nasi lemak.."
Really very pricy and yet really tasteless! Worse than normal nasi lemak! Don't buy! Waste my money
Nice but too ex.
Great. Rice made with fresh pressed coconut. Fabulous sambal sotong.
"I remember this stall from the time before this food centre underwent a major renovation for quite a long period. Wanted to give them a try on my past few trips but they were either sold out or closed.

I was quite fortunate that they were still operating at around 12.30pm. However there isnt much dishes left.My meal sets me SGD$4.90 which consisted of a fried chicken wing, sunny side up, fishcake and the anchovies & peanuts. Their chili is on the sweeter side. Rice was fluffy and has a rich taste of the coconut. A pity that the chicken wing wasnt  crispy.

Nevertheless, a decent plate of Nasi Lemak."
Delicious fluffy fragrant rice with sambal that is just right in seasonings. Yummy
"Wide variety of selection and pronounce lemak in the rice too. However I'm giving only 3 stars because the chili sauce is not as spicy.
I hope that they can have 2 version depending on the spiciness that customers want."
"Delicious Nasi Lemak, fully customizable with a good choice of add ons, very popular so usually a queue, but worth a little wait!"
Great Nasi Lemak. Even though we went just before closing food was fresh and very flavourful. Not greasy
Truly authentic nasi lemak with a taste reminiscent of the good old days. May be a little pricey considering the portions but very tasty
"Undoubtedly, this has to be one of the best nasi lemak in Singapore. The rice is fragrant and fluffy, the chicken is fabulous and crispy, the fish is so fresh and the sambal is fabulously delicious.
The owner is very pleasant and friendly too.
Enjoy..."
"It has been a long since I have my nasi lemak here as the food centre was closed for upgrading for a long time. The rice still tastes just as good as before but the chicken wing seems to be a little smaller than before renovation and my favourite fish is missing! After the upgrade, the price has also increased to $4.10. I think previously was $3.80. If you don't mind the price, the food is good. "
"Every aspect of this nasi lemak was well though out. Tempeh, rice, and sambal all fantastic. I prefer my eggs w run yolk though. Hits the spot overall if you are craving nasi lemak."
"Food quality has been consistent over many years, but the boss' ethics is a bit questionable (cheated me and my friend when we were kids in secondary school many years ago). I still go back because his food is delicious.

Rice is fragrant and fluffy. Sambal is not too sweet or spicy. Sad thing is that the fish is no longer part of the set but it's understandable due to rising costs."
Friendly stall owner and the nasi lemak is not bad. The bergadil (fried potato cake) is crispy. The rice and chilli went well together even though the chilli wasn't spicy. Can definitely smell the coconut in the rice and taste it too. The chicken was Super lemak and not spicy. Overall definitely a good plate.
"Fragrant rice, crispy chicken. Oh the sotong is nice and soft."
"Nasi lemak as it is supposed to be, flurry with coconut fragrant. Tempeh fried crispy on outside and tender/moist within. Was thinking of standard fried chicken wing but was recommended redang chciekn. That's a good recommendation, redang is favourfull and brings out the chicken taste. Fresh cucumber and Sambal chili makes food complete as well as icing to cake."
Nasi lemak store which also used to be Nasi Padang
"First scoop and you'll notice how fragrant and fluffy is the rice. I thought I could eat the rice on it's own but the chili is good too and doesn't overpower the fragrance of the rice too much.  The tempeh was crispy and yummy, so was the chicken wing. Their taste and quality has been very consistent too. Could come back to this again and again."
"Love the authentic Malay Nasi Lemak esp. sambal, fried fish n chicken wing. Highly recommended."
Very delicious and the rice smell wonderful. A bit pricy but totally worth it!
IT'S SO GOOD I GET HUNGRY EVEN THINKING ABOUT IT. I'm going for another plate tomorrow. If they're open. If they're not sold out. Go in the morning to avoid disappointment. IMO it's one of the top Nasi Lemaks in Singapore - definitely can stand against if not win the big names like Punggol and Boon Lay Power NL. Shiok. Sedap. Salivating.
This is the way nasi lemak should be
Super good! highly recommend. best nasi lemak in singapore

"Delectable local favorite with coconut rice, chicken wing, kuning fish, anchovies, sunny side up and that irresistable sambal chilli !"
"The soup is da bomb, prawn umami rich.  There is a queue at 10am but it moves fast."
Was the shrimp ramen I waited an hour to order at this restaurant really worth it? I wondered.
Noodles have a perfect chew with a rich prawn broth.
"Must add ""powdered"" intestines , overall i like it a lot. Except for the price and queuing time. Whampoe one the soup more strong."
"They raised prices again and it just doesnt justify me coming back when you have East Treasures prawn mee just 50m away - cheaper, richer stock, better ambiance. No wonder there's no more queues at Dadong. Ridiculous prices."
I challenge a more flavourful bowl of prawn mee than Da Dong! The best time to beat the queue is 7-8am.
"It's overrated.

Ordered one soup and one dry, both yellow noodles.

When the food came, both bowls were soup, and one of them was bee hoon mee. We pointed out the mistake, and they took it back. But when it returned, it was clearly the same bowl with the soup just poured out -- no change to the noodles -- and the chilli was sloppily slapped on top.

For the price they charge, I expected basic attention to the order. Definitely disappointed."
"Not worth it periodt
Order came wrong. Informed the auntie but the cook did it halfheartedly.
For $10/bowl, the portion killed my appetite. Felt ripped off.
Taste was okay but I prefer beach road. Even though a bowl at beach road cost 80% more, I'd still be willing to pay premium for it because the price is justified. Sorry to say this is going to be my first and last time."
Nice simple prawn with pork ribs noodle...
"The Soup and chill sauce has changed. Previously was Kai Wei, now I just wouldn't want to go back. The soup is bland, the chilli sauce doesn't not match the prawn noodle."
"This time I decided to order soup instead of dry. The thick broth is spot on, rich umami prawn flavour. Generous serving of noodles/kwaytiao with 3pcs pork ribs + 4pcs prawns.
I feel they can better their service, to reduce the waiting time."
Best prawn noodle ever.
"while there may be a wait on popular mornings, the soup and noodles are always done well. clean on the palate, soup version is better imo. also love the intestine soup if youre in luck to order it"
"Mind brawling Prawn noodle.
I think the Best Prawn noodle indeed.
The best part is their soup mouthful of prawn flavour and very complex and thick.
Noodle they done very well as well.
Good texture and portion.
Once all mix together with chilli & pork fat, wow cannot tell how good noodle here is."
Ordered a pork rib prawn noodle regular ($8). Got a total of 1 prawn and 1 tiny pork rib. Generous indeed.
"Over rated, deceived by the long Q.

Bang average flavors, very expensive.

40mins to 60mins Q to order, then served to table the next 5mins.

Soup does not refill, and portion given for soup or dry option is very minimal.

Soup option and dry option has different Soup flavor.
Dry option has richer flavor Soup.

Very very thirsty hours after the meal"

Good varieties of prawn noodles and other dishes
The prawn noodle soup version is cooked just right and flavourful. The side dishes are very good also.
Over price prawn noodles. Portions are so small for the large @10.dollars. Prawns are those small ones that are been cut into half. Soup is slightly above average.  Had way better prawn noodles that is of more value to your bucks.
The owners are delivering good foods with their good hearts.
"Quite salty for both dry and soup version, and it's a small portion for $8/$10 but the noodle texture is perfect."
"This is one of the better prawn noodles in SG. Noodles' texture was so good and springy. The chilli was also very nice, fragrant with a tinge of sourness. Soup was also gao and ingredients fresh. The liver was cooked just nice too, not overcooked nor undercooked."
"Prawn and taste is gooodddd lucky to be the 2nd last person, if want to try need to go there earlier"
The best prawn noodle in Singapore.
"Really over rated and expensive. Not worth the wait and portions so small. No soup refill and yet have such a small bowl...even smaller than my last visit a decade ago. Friend wanted to try and I thought maybe I was biased previously as I got put off by the $2 charge for extra soup.

Went back again and agree it's good but the soup given is really monocle...barely covers the noodle for soup version. Liver is good."
Saturday morning. Not worth the q during weekend. Prawn noodles taste so so.  Owner have a attitude problem.  Can have one at any other prawn noodle stores.
"Only few minutes away from our hotel, very convenient and accessible, very affordable too. The place is very packed on a Wednesday but manage to enter quite fast. Highly recommend to try their Fu Pi Xia!"
"Great disappointment!!!
Over priced. Not value for money. The taste is not justified. I've tasted even better prawn mee and pork rib mee with reasonably priced.
Coffee shop Atmosphere a lot of pigeons hovering around as you eat."
"Queued 30 mins, waited 30 mins. Best prawn mee till date in SG thanks to its fresh prawns and broth is definitely the bomb. Umami all over.
Would recommend getting dry noodles for extra taste on the noodles!"
"Was walking by on a quiet Sunday and saw that there was only one person in the queue. So I joined and waited for my turn. When I wanted to order, the guy just gestured for me to wait. While he did some random things. Why can't I be allowed to order first? Instead he made me stand and wait 10 mins. The food itself was pretty bad. The pig tail has a very strong taste and the prawn noodles was almost tasteless due to the stingy amount of sauce. What a complete waste of space, not to mention expensive too. Blanco court prawn noodles are definitely much better."
"Broth is light but hearty.
The best prawn noodles in sg.
They remember my order even after lengthy time away. :)"
"Visited at about 1pm on a Friday, and there was about 3-4 people in front of me. Not the fastest service in terms of cooking but also not the slowest.
Ordered the large bowl - pork ribs prawn noodles (dry). The soup does have a lot of umami, but the noodles could use more condiments/sauce. I had more noodles than sauce. If comparing it with Beach Road Prawn Mee, I would pick Beach Road Prawn Mee over this."
Delicious af. Super rich soup base that is full of shrimp flavor. Every sip is an enjoyment.
"Been eating this Da Dong Prawn Noodle since those days when they are operating in Balam Road Market. Seen generation changes, but the taste get better from each changing  generation. To me n my family, they are still the best taste of all."
Went on a weekday morning 11am not much crowd. Waited around 20 mins. Small is $5 Regular is $8 and Large is $10. The soup no prawn taste and abit bland for me. The noodle is too hard for us. The portion for the $10 is ok. Overall is average.
"Ordered 2 regular prawn noodles - 1 dry and 1 soup. Overall verdict

- soup quality: not much prawn flavor, lots of pepper, pretty disappointing on the quality for the price of $8
- quantity: don't get me started. I thought I order 2 bowls of instant noodles and they forgot to put any seasoning. The ingredients given is soooooo pathetic that it can make it for a comedy stand up episode. 1) 1 regular prawn sliced into 3 parts; 2) I believe pork lard and fried onions are not that exp, please give more... Come on, for the price of $8, it is a joke.
- service: definitely a self made queue. 5 mins for one order.... Perhaps we can take a bath before returning to order."
Too expensive for what's offered. No soup refills. Tastes like any standard prawn noodle.
"I arrived at here at 7:30am (which is when they open) on a weekend, & was 3rd in line. I waited 24 mins to place my order... & in that time, I realized I wasn't the actual 3rd in line. People sit down after having placed their orders, so I was a fake 3rd 

Sadly, they messed up my order. I ordered a Pork Rib Prawn Noodles (large) & a Prawn Noodles (regular) - but both were served as large portions. Oh well. At least they were delicious.

The soup is light yet tasty, & doesn't leave you feeling overwhelmed with the flavours. Unfortunately, they don't do free soup refills, which may be a turn-off to some.

I would've liked a refill of this tasty bowl.. But I did order a Pork Intestine Soup all for myself, so that satisfied me. It doesn't look like much, but for 1 pax, this was great. Intestines were chewy without being rubbery, & were cleaned well.

By 8:00am (this was on a Sunday), there were already 10 people in line....  Would I go back? Idk. I don't like queuing, so probably not."
"Attendant was busy with other things while patrons wait in queue to order. There were only 2 people in front of me, all of us were waiting for the attendant to take our orders. The queue didn't move for at least 15 minutes. Next the food, it is not worth it for the price you pay. I paid $15 for a bowl of large prawn noodles (see picture). Only 4 halves of a prawn, so technically 2 whole prawns for $15. Add on intestines $5 for those few pieces. Total $21 for that bowl you see. Really not worth it. Flavours are nice but this sort of high pricing and unnecessary queueing leaves a bad experience which I won't want to have anymore. Besides, great flavours are everywhere. Will not be visiting this stall again. Good luck on your business. And good bye."
Very nice food
"Soup cannot refill, after a long Que mask them see able to put more soup. Don't seem to want to give. I cancel and go another place"
"I visited the stall on a Saturday morning at around 8:30 am, and there was no queue. This was my first time visiting this stall, so I ordered the Pork Rib Prawn Noodle to try both the pork rib and prawn. The prawn soup base was balanced and not too strong in prawn flavor. The prawn was ordinary, and the pork rib could have been softer. Overall, it was a decent bowl of prawn noodle. However, two friends highly recommended this stall, claiming it is their favorite."

"Would rate a 3.5.

Above average prawn noodle, benchmarking from ""Beach Road Prawn Noodle"" at East Coast Road and ""Prawn Mee"" hakwer stall at Blk 216 Bedok North hawker run by two young chap (not 216 prawn mee).

The price for a regular bowl $8 is on the high side. We order the pork bib with prawn. The halfed prawns were scrawny (as usual?) but the pork ribs were decent, very home cooked style. The Diao Wei seems to be missing something.

Personally, I'd think 30mins que or waiting time is abit long, during peak traffic."
"it's not bad, but not worth the queue or the price"
"Prawn noodle broth was so average/below average, could barely taste the prawn broth in the soup.
For 8$ Regular Sized i only got 1 prawn and 2 pork ribs? Ridiculous pricing for 8$. Other places like beach road give much more prawns and pork ribs.

The wait was also close to 40 minutes just for this bowl of prawn noodles.

Cannot ask for more chilli padi, cannot ask for more soup. Stingy business."
"Da Dong Prawn Noodles

2nd Review - Current
Still I had to go back to ask for more chilli, this time, I had prawns with pork ribs and added pigs tail, the soup was quite good except it was lighter but more salty. There was traces of lard in the noodle but not enough to bring up the taste and without the additional chilli, it was otherwise bland. Nothing special on the ribs and pigs tail. Today, the market is more competitive, it is now just slightly better than average and it is a matter of time that others will chase up and soon it may just be average. The important thing is that people will still continue to support if they like their soup because it is still a little different from what you get from competitors, old school prawn mee is slowly dying out.

1st Review - 2021 - 5****

After hearing about this place, it has been in my want to go list for the longest time. I don't go Joo Chiat often and since the craving came and timing looks good, I made a trip down!  It was a short wait, the first few bowls of the day. I asked for more chili and I had to go back for more. It's not spicy enough though it goes well with the noodles. Not among the best chili I had but good enough. The pork ribs were a little small but the peppery tender meat just came off the bone with my tender pull. The prawns were fresh and had the texture I like, taut and tasty! The pork lard bits were a little lesser than what I usually get but the noodles were well coated with the lard. The highlight was the soup. Indeed, it's very good. I am tempted to say it's the best soup but there is a very familiar taste in it that I cannot put my finger on. After pondering over a few hours, I think I recalled where that flavor came from. So the soup here is very balanced and rich in taste but not rich in body, meaning it's not very thick. Behind the prawn taste is something rich and it does not overpower like other places do where you might get Bak Kut Teh with prawns rather than Prawn soup with pork. Being unique, it wil remain special and that is good enough to keep you hooked. There are others that hooked me in a similar way but obviously with a different twist.

"I'm in line for the last 30mins to see them clear 4 customers and have another 4 in front of me. All these waiting whille standing. The person who was cooking at one point was also the same person who took the orders and had mixed it up, so he had to drop everything and head out to serve.
The main chap who returned was checking his phone, taking their time to prepare. That lacklustre attitude probably translates into the flavour in their noodles. So is it really worth the wait? I'm seriously doubting it.
Not to mention their prices are exorbitant for a local bowl of noodles. I guess for the one bowl they make, they also lose one another customer; without actually providing an equivalent quantity as charged. Not cool."
Super bad service. Got ignored while asking if they're ready for business
good prawn noodle but the soup they provided is very little and could have given more. portion is very small and might not be enough to eat. Overall is delicious
Don't come here.... Long queue but noodle does not taste good at all.
"Not my kind of prawn noodle. The chilli taste different from my usual kind of prawn noodles. Staff were meticulous in preparing and cooking that bowl of noodles.

Despite their busy-ness they still serve us up to the table. Would I queue 30 mins for that very bowl? No.. feel free to try as it might suit your taste but unfortunately not mine."
"Food was alright, abit spicy but the noodles were well cooked. It took longer than expected (queue + food), around 30 over minutes. There aren't many seats though so we had to share a table with another group."
Ordered $8 yellow mee with bee hoon dry pork ribs prawn noodles and pig tail soup. Soup is umami and the sauce really tastes different compared to most prawn noodles. Prawns are sweet and pork ribs are tender. Pig tail is passable imho.
"Food is good. Soup tastes great.

But I won't return because the soup given is pathetic. Stated in the signboard that soup is non refillable so we bought additional pork ribs soup $8. Soup given barely cover the meat. Asked for more soup since we paid, they added but still just a little more only. Barely fill the small bowl.

Pork slices in the noodles are thinly sliced."
Best PRAWN MEE
"Get ready to be captivated by the rich and flavoursome soup, reminiscent of a luxurious prawn bisque. Their signature dish, the prawn and spare ribs noodles, is a true standout, marrying succulent prawns with tender spare ribs in a symphony of taste and texture.

For a personalised culinary journey, I recommend trying my go-to order: prawn and spare ribs with a combination of egg noodles and thin rice noodles, served dry with slices of liver. This tantalising dish comes with a side of super umami prawn soup, adding an extra layer of indulgence to your dining experience. Get ready to savour every bite at Da Dong Prawn Noodles."
"Prawn noodle broth is best in singapore. Bettee than blanco court or beach road imo. However, service is slow and portion of soup is small if u get dry. No refills allowed. But soup is very thick, so can tell its very precious."
"The prawns are soggy, broth is quite tasteless and the dry mee with chilli has no kick... went to try as saw it had long queue... not sure what the hype is about... the tong Bao prawn noodle down the street is much better to my liking"
"what seems like a typical 15mins  queue turn out to be an hour's wait

Food is just decent."
"Best, truly the best! Just need to be there early as they sold out fast."
Heard so much about this place. Worth the hype but do come early as it's a small coffee shop with limited seating area. The soup stands out because it is slightly herbal compared to the usual soy sauce taste.
The prawn noodles soup was amazing especially the flavorful broth. They could be more generous with the broth though as it did not even cover the noodles. Also queue is long as service is slow (moves every 5 minutes)
Dessert was super refreshing! A must try!
"The stall onwer so snobbish....went there at 1pm and the man say no more the woman laugh and say she angry.... this is not acceptable
Shd state business hours is up ro 9am in the morning instead of 230pm that wont waste ppls time"
The soup was amazing. Great service too. Will be back for more.
Gao Gao.. superb
Passed this coffee shop and saw a long queue so thought it must be good. Turn out otherwise. I had tried much better authentic prawn elsewhere. The soup is not authentic prawn broth but seems to have added miso inside. Not worth the wait and money. Overpriced for big prawn noodle with just 2 big prawns. Tried once and will not come back again. Not recommended.
"Soup was flavourful. Noodles was tasty. In my opinion, better than Beach Road prawn noodle."
"Read some not so good reviews on google and was a bit wary but was very pleasantly surprised by how flavorful it tasted! Ordered the soup prawn mee, amount of ingredient might not be too plentiful but overall still quite delicious and satisfying for me. Need to go early to avoid long ques."
"Food aside (which is a v.gd, decent bowl of noodles, do try if queue is short), I think there needs to be operational efficiency in the way the store is run and the food is prepared. The wait can be very long even if the queue is not that bad. And observation will tell u dat there are areas for improvement and the owners are not that bothered about making customers wait (the first in the queue was not acknowledged or had their orders taken for more than 5 mins). This would also mean bad business for the other potential stores (currently empty) and drinks store in the kopitiam becuz of the long turnover of customers.

Anyway, if you are not a fan of waiting, there is another prawn noodles store (east treasures) just a stone's throw away. Not too bad a bowl of noodles, better CS, slightly more exp but there's air cooler and better seats. A gd alternative when u are fed up with the waiting at da dong haha"
"Tried this prawn noodles.
Ordered dry version and they gave only very little soup and cannot refill. Long queue not sure why.
Okok only."
"Best prawn mee hands down. The soup is so rich and good, and portions are just right. Get dry noodles for the gao-est soup possible but either ways is still yums."
Long que so check out. Super disappointing meat was tough and the chilli for dried version also lack taste. Will give this store a miss
"Use to like the prawn noodles here but was disappointed today. Both dry noodle were quite tasteless, ingredients for the pricing seems quite little. Waited for 45mins for a not so long queue. Perhaps soup version might be better. Don't think it's worth coming back again unless they improve."
"Don't come on weekends.

Q for almost 20mins just to have a bowl of noodles. 

Value for money? Definitely not."
"Don't understand why people would queue for this. Saw that really small portions were served, pathetic amount of soup served, poor service (look at the nonchalant attitude of the chef and assistant), hot and stuffy ambience especially if there is a queue.

The short queue can be deceiving, 4-5 customers ahead of me, but I waited for 30 minutes and gave up. Never again.

P.S. there is a service pledge which that included on their price list which, quite frankly, is cringey."
"Zhe Jia Dian De Xia Mian Tang Tou Nong Yu Xian Tian,Xia Zi Xin Xian Dan Ya,Da Pei Huang Mian He Zhu You Zha
Huan Ke Yi Jia Yi Dian La Jiao,Bao Zheng Rang Ni Chi De Guo Yin"
Food is good and quality of ingredients is not bad. Food served is more towards home cooked food kinda homeliness rather than commercial kopitiam food. However portions can be on the small side and amount of soup is limited while refill is not allowed. I didn't come during peak hours hence wait was bearable and reasonable.
"Not worth and lousy service. For a regular bowl of prawn noodles ($8), they gave me like 5 to 6 half slices of prawns, pathetic spinach stalks (no leaves) and a small portion of noodles. People who gave 4 to 5 stars have not tried better ones elsewhere. And you can sense the two brothers (?) - cook and service staff are just not interested in their work. So amused there's a queue and they are surviving."
Delicious and value for money .
"Reasonable prawn noodle, I tabao so never took pic, parking is difficult. Had it many years ago. Didn't had much impression of it. Try again this round think still same , did not wow me but as I said everyone has different preferences."
"My favourite prawn noodle in East coast (there's at least 2 others in the area). Nice thick umami sweet broth, with just the right amount of pork lard. Their normal sized prawns are just nice and I like that they came peeled (jumbo prawn doesn't)."
I have tasted better. Salty broth. Very mediocre heartland prawn Mee noodles.
"The enduring success of Da Dong Prawn Noodle on Joo Chiat, now stewarded by two brothers, offers a profound meditation on continuity, legacy, and the essence of culinary tradition. In a world of constant flux, the consistent fullness of this establishment speaks to a deep human yearning for constancy and authenticity in our experiences.

The preservation of taste across generations invites us to contemplate the nature of knowledge transfer and the delicate balance between innovation and tradition. How do the brothers maintain the essence of their predecessor's craft while inevitably imparting their own touch? This culinary torch-passing becomes a microcosm for broader cultural inheritance, challenging us to consider how we maintain our collective identity in the face of inevitable change.

The heavenly pork ribs broth, a seemingly simple concoction, embodies the alchemical transformation of humble ingredients into transcendent experience. It prompts us to reflect on the nature of craftsmanship and the intangible elements that elevate sustenance to art. What ineffable qualities emerge from the confluence of skill, time, and intention?

The perpetual crowds at Da Dong speak to our social nature and the role of shared culinary experiences in community building. In choosing to queue and dine here, patrons participate in a collective ritual that goes beyond mere nourishment. It becomes an affirmation of shared values and a tacit acknowledgment of the establishment's role in the local cultural fabric.

Ultimately, Da Dong Prawn Noodle stands as a testament to the power of continuity in a transient world, inviting us to savor not just the flavors, but the deeper connections to tradition, community, and the enduring human quest for excellence.                "
Queued abt 45 min for lunch. Ordered regular prawn noodles soup. Broth is quite rich. A bit pricey for a bowl of prawn noodles
"The young gentleman that was responsible for the cooking was very nice and polite. Genuinely living and breathing his customer promise that he's got listed out at the front of the store! There is a precision in his cooking that should be more appreciated. A culinary treasure that should be appreciated!

Got the bee Hoon noodles dry w chili. Flavour was just perfect. The soup was perfectly balanced w notes of garlic and prawns and pork.

Portions was on point too w ya daily dose of vegetables covered here.

If ya pay 15-18 Singapore dollars for ramen. We should pay the same to make sure our hawker culture and hawkers are taken care of.

Will definitely come back."
"Best prawn mee in Singapore and it's not even close. Soup is the highlight here. Intense, sweet and umami  -- very different from the tau you (dark soy sauce) soup that you get from other famous prawn mee stalls. Obviously, only order the soup version. If you come to Da Dong and order dry, I don't really know what to say..."
Food not bad but too pricey for a prawn mee.
"Don't know why so many social media still recommending them 

Super overrated & expensive. Although I don't eat a lot, I remember the portion is little, tiny prawn & pork slice is a miserable few slice. I always take soup version and the soup is nothing to rave about either.

The coffeeshop is also very difficult to find seat due to overcrowding of people who encourage overpricing? 

Visit once and never again. "
"Solid prawn mee! The broth here really stands out. You can taste the hours that went into it, with nothing else crowding the pure prawn flavor. Pairing dry noodles with sips of soup is quite a transcending experience. We'll be back to try other variations and offerings!"
"Flavourful, full bodied prawn broth. My go to prawn noodle in the Katong Joo Chiat area. I like that the quality is really consistent and I never fail to have a good meal here.

Personal opinion: Always get the dry version to enjoy the freshness of the prawn and ribs with the springy noodles, mixed generously with crispy pork lard and the chili. Plus, you get to enjoy the soup unadulterated.

Caution: DO NOT LEAVE YOUR FOOD UNATTENDED! The area has some really gungho birds really to pounce as soon as you step away from the table. The shop aunty saved my bowl of noodles when I went to top up my chili."
"Lard is fresh and crispy.
Soup a bit too salty.
Prawns and pork ribs were fresh and yummy"
"This stall serves a more 'atas' prawn noodle with a broth liken to a drunken prawn soup. The noodles are al dente, the prawns are medium size. The crispy bits of lard makes each bite enjoyable. The normal $10 size prawn noodles is good for a lady. Stall holders are nice and friendly. Ask for more soup as the soup is non refillable. Go early as it gets sold out probably by 1130am easily. Definitely worth a visit!!!!!"
Hao Chi De 
In my opinion the best prawn mee in Singapore. Just be patient when queuing
Soup is excellent. Chef was very nice to waive some fees when he got my order wrong. Much appreciated for the great service. Will be back!
Nice soup prawn noodles but the amount of noodles is on the lesser side. Soup very robust. The second bowl is a mix of liver and intestine. A bit expensive as it was for $8 at the time of this post.
"Ji Shuang Yi Xia. Pai Gu Hen Hao Chi A. Huan Bi Rou Gu Cha De Hao Chi. Wo Bu Chi ,Dan Kan Qi Lai Fei Chang Xin Xian You Da. Xia Ci Dai Quan Jia Ren Yi Qi Lai.  easily the best prawn noodles in the east."
"Taste just like how my late mother used to make it at home! Super flavorful and authentic, it hits all the right notes for me. Thank you chef and family, i like your cool and unhurried service."
best big prawn mee!
"Coffee shop environment , acceptable price , prawn noodles are really good.  The big prawns are very, very fresh!"
"Protip: avoid queueing unless you can afford to wait. Self service chili powder in case you forget.

Good: 1. soup has a touch of herbal taste to it, but it's abit salty. 2. Plenty of parking, decent number of seats at coffeeshop.

Bad: 1. LONG WAIT for a queue that isn't even that long. Waited 30mins for about 6 pax ahead of me. 2. Big prawns were out of stock. 3. Regular prawn mee bowl did not have much ingredients/prawns. 4. Sneaky price list, smallest (and cheapest) bowls are placed on the right, somewhat misleading. Generally really pricey noodles. 5. Chili powder isn't your usual bright red type for prawn mee, it's more like those for pizza ? 6. Soup bowl for dry mee really small, recommend getting soup noodles if you want more soup."
SO-SO ONLY. OVERRATED. OVERLY PRICED. WILL NOT PATRONISE AGAIN.
One of the better prawn noodles. But not cheap. Broth was good and prawns were super fresh. Ordered the $10 prawn noodles. Cheapest was $8 so quite pricey. The pork rib one was nicer. But very satisfying and they serve the meal to you after you place the order. But they stingy with the soup lol
"This is my go-to place for prawn noodles. Sauce for the dry spicy prawn noodles is delicious and flavorful, chili is spicy but not overpowering. Pork ribs are very well cooked and tender."
"Very normal prawn noodle, mild taste in the soup. Not worth the wait. Small portion"
Has been supporting for many years already. Great taste and thick broth. Love the pork lard. Always run out of pig tails (next time I should go earlier). Opposite big carpark plenty of lots during non peak period.
"Came here thrice for breakfast and had similar experiences each time. Sellers will boil their soup, slice prawns, prepare bowls, and ask you to stand and wait for about 10 minutes until they are ready to take your order. Meanwhile, familiar customers will go to the side, inform the cook of their order and go to their seats, without queuing. Sellers should take orders and write it down, let customers have a seat, be fairer and kinder to their customers.
The saving grace is that the soup broth is thick and tasty, overall quality of food is good."
Ate the dry pork rib prawn noodle regular size..the soup is delicious and doesn't make one thirst after the meal(no msg or perhaps very little). Packed a bee Hoon pork rib prawn noodle and ate the day after...still tasted very good..thumbs up to the young chef..friendly and very customer oriented
"This place use to call Ren Ren Da Xia Mian. It has been changed to Da Tong. I tried once or twice when it was using the old name. Today I decided to give it a try since quite a number of people buying. Soup not bad, taste good. Noodle texture also ok. Price a little high consider a coffee shop store."
"Big prawn noodles ($15 for medium bowl) - The 5 big prawn halves were fresh and easy of their shells. The soup had good depth of flavour.

From an earlier visit:
Enjoyed the large bowl of prawn bee hoon ($10). Fresh medium size prawns, nice bee hoon and good broth. The pork ribs were sold out by the time I was there at 1pm."
"The taste is just like normal
Nothing especial about it.
Waste time , waste stomach space for it"
Taking a very long time to serve.
One of the best prawn mee in Singapore. Soup is super flavourful!
"The best prawn noodles in SG imo,
in terms of size of prawn, broth, sauces & noodles everything is just right.

Tried many prawn noodles in SG either prawns are too small, not fresh or too saucy noodles. Even beach road prawn noodles doesn't come close to Da Dong. Only regret is why I didn't discover it earlier 

I usually have the $8/$10 dry prawn noodles with yellow & white noodles. I would still prefer without the pork rib, just personal preference

The owner is friendly & nice, two young gentlemen."
Long queues around lunchtime but well worth it. Broth was incredible and prawns even came peeled!! Pricier than an average hawker but well worth it.
"Wasted an hour queuing for such miserable quantity & mediocre food for such expensive price. Total waste of time

And they are so dishonest to only give 3 slices of half prawn & 2 thin slices of lean pork for $8 when I actually ordered pork rib & prawn noodle for take away. Only realised the missing pork rib when I reached home.

If only I can opt for NO star, I would"
"The noodle is good, chili is good too. I find that the broth is more garlicky than prawny. A lot of crows made the dining environment uncomfortable. Service is good"
One of the Best if not the Best 
Good bowl of prawn noodle. Will try the soup version next time
"Like what other reviewers commented, if you order the soup version, the soup does not cover all the ingredients; it's like only HALF soup after stirring upon arrival, so miserly. Service staff is quite grumpy type.

1st spoon taste: underlying slight tinge of sour.
30mins later: layer on tongue... ?

I ordered from this stall only because the wonton mee stall closed today..."
"When it comes to fixing a prawn noodle crave, this is where I will come.

My order is usually beehoon mee in their signature savoury prawn soup/broth with prawn and pork ribs."
"Not bad but not worth the queue,queue was not long but very slow because they let regular customers cut the queue without queuing just show them their faces and sit down and wait."
"I am prawn mee serial eater in SG. Fought countless battles to find the best prawn mee in Singapore and have to admit this is the best around. The soup taste good (doesn't use prawn paste) without making you thirsty, the garnishing was just nice, and noodle was also well cooked. The only downside is the queue is always at least 30 mins and you need to pray no one in front of you order a big orders, if not it'll be even longer. I've stopped visiting elsewhere and this is now the retiring place for my prawn mee battles.

p/s please visit before 1pm if not it'll be sold out base on experience"
"There is a reason why this is the go-to place for many prawn noodles lovers. The stall took a less is more approach when it comes to seasoning, nothing overpowering, letting you savour the different layers of flavours, every mouthful is gratifying. The soup elevates the experience to another level, full bodies and rich like a umami bomb. Unfortunately they don't entertain refills. Was sold out by noon when I was there, better come early to avoid disappointment."
"Wei Dao Yi Ban He Qian Duo Huan Shao De Fu Wu Tai Du,Jie Qian Huan Bu Bian Yi,Bu Hui Zai Lai Liao. "
Nice broth and the seasoning for the dry ingredients are good. Long queue but still acceptable waiting time.
"Though only 5-6 persons ahead of me, it was still almost an hour wait because there's already a group who ordered and seated waiting for their food. This was when you felt having a fully self-service system makes sense as it gave you a more realistic estimate of the wait you might encounter.

While queueing, the 'no refill of soup' on their menu caught my attention. I decided to order the soup version expecting that it will have more soup than the dry version, I was so wrong. While the under portion of the soup did not necessarily turn the dish bad, the robustness of the soup was compromise by the alkalinity of the noodle. Which is a shame because apart from the soup, all other aspects of the dish were well put together."
We waited almost 30 minutes because they let regulars cut queue. The noodle is also really bland and tasteless. Only the soup is not bad but overall not worth the price and queue at all.
"I love prawns noodles and would try out different ones. This has to be one of my favourites, the broth is rich and flavourful, I savoured every drop of it. The ingredients were generous too. I would wish to enjoy it in a more comfortable environment but I guess this would do."
"Short queue but long wait. The people can just cut queue and the owner actually allow this practice. The prawn soup is nice, but the noodle soso only. In conclusion, not worth it."
Food is slowly served. There are also resident pigeons flying onto the coffeeshop tables. Best not to dine in.
"The place was very crowded and it was really difficult to find a seat. The queue to order the food was also long. After ordering, it took about 30 mins for the food to be served. The portion was quite small for the price. The soup broth was rich. It was ok but not worth the long wait."
"Came in a party of five and we ordered both the dry and soup versions.  The soup version only had a half bowl of soup which barely covered the ingredients whereas the dry version had no excess sauce.

The dry version however was full of flavour and had the right amount of spiciness.  That said, at 8 dollars a bowl it is severely overpriced.  Come and try it once unless money is not a concern."
"Ordered pork ribs prawn noodles with chili, tasting above average but not spicy."
"Was told its a gem at joo chiat. So have been wanting to try for a while. Well, i guess most reviewers may have been a tad too generous with their words. I personally find that its not worth the $8 i paid for. Nor my wife who had the same. The soup were meh! though its got enough flavor to pass off as prawn noodles soup. The ingredients for $8 were pitiful. I concur with some reviews that there are better options nearby. Will probably not return."
"Hands doen best prawn noodles I've tasted in SG
Get the BIG prawn noodles "
"Massive letdown. Soup was not flavourful at all - pretty much tasteless save a tiny bit of prawn taste at the end. Very stingy with soup also - barely enough to cover the noodles which soaked up everything?

Bought a $13 portion of the big prawn noodle - came with 1.5 big prawns. Basically 3x half prawns. ??? why the 0.5? prawns were nice and fresh though.

Bought another $8 portion of the normal prawn noodle - 2 small prawns, basically 4x half prawns.

Also noticed in the reviews they covered the small portions up on the board. I didn't even notice it myself. Not a nice feeling... they used to be better pre-covid."
I finally tried it and I was not impressed. The broth was tasteless and not flavorful. Also the broth barely covers the noodles. And the wooden chopsticks stinks like an old rug. The other prawn noodle shop down the road East treasure taste better in my opinion.
"I found it way far too expensive for the price we paid.
The prawns were split into 2 to make it look as though the bowl was filled with prawns.
Portions was very very little.
Service staff was not very friendly.
We ordered 2 bowls and each bowl costs S$8-00. So we paid total of $16.
Has inflation really pushed up the prices so bad ?
How do the poor survive ? Just wondering .
There are other & many places in Singapore that gives better portions for the same price we paid. Yes they had other menus at much higher prices. The choice is yours.
Short queues depending on the days.
If you can afford the price by ALL means go there but my humble opinion I wouldn't ever go there again but find another stall in Spore which gives you quality, quantity & taste for $8-00.
Honestly you can even cook it yourself by looking at the best videos in youtube.
My opinion might differ from yours.
Thanks"
"We went to try the prawn noodles this morning (Sunday) and ordered the smallest option that costs $5 each.  The noodles were served in little bowls with soup that barely covered the noodles and ingredients.  They really reminded me of what I had from my primary school canteen.  The taste is acceptable but not the service.  Everyone around us ordered at least the $8 prawn noodles and were served with chilli + soya sauce but ours came without; we had to help ourselves.  If they are not happy to serve customers who placed order for $5, then take it off the menu.  Why the discriminatory treatment?"
"Ordered two portions of pork rib prawn noodle soup, one regular $8 and the other large $10. Photo shown is the regular portion.

I really have no clue as to why other reviewers claim the soup broth is fragrant and unique. It tastes quite ordinary and is far from fragrant. I love noodles, but I couldn't finish them nor the soup. The pork ribs were over cooked and too tough. Prawn was quite tender and sweet.

The menu is written in quite a sneaky way - you'd think they'd write the size in terms of small, regular, large ie. in increasing size from left to right but nope, they put the ""small"" portion right at the back and conveniently cover the prices of the menu with the plastic bags lol.

Food took about 15 mins to come at 11.45am on a Sunday. I'd much rather go to another more popular prawn noodle place in the area."
"Update
Visited on 28 Oct 2023.
Tried the dried one - noodle still were on the softer side for my liking, but soup was really really good with lots of garlic taste.
Added pork intestine soup, which some were bitter some were nice but the soup was somehow not hot.
Bonus point for the prawn being peeled though!

---------------------------------
The soup is on the sweeter side, but can taste the thick prawn taste as well. The noodles were a bit soft for my liking but the overall satisfaction is high. With the amount and taste, definitely worth the money."
Food is ok. Feel high price. $8 for this small portion of noodle. Environment not so nice as got pigeon and Crow fly in and out to hunt for food.
"I chanced upon this stall as I noticed that they had a good crowd of patrons dining in the coffeeshop. So out of curiosity, I ordered a $10 portion to takeaway. The person who took my order seemed cold and unfriendly but nevertheless he got my order right and I waited for about 20 minutes which was not too bad given the size of the crowd there. I wasn't expecting much when I finally sat down at home to eat the food but I'm glad that I tried this shop because the food is nice.  The only gripe is that the portion felt quite small for $10."
"broth here is unique, of the saltier than sweet variation, still rich and robust nonetheless.

prawns were plump and fresh, ribs were well marinated rand tender. noodles are just noodles

do note that the process from ordering to having the food reach your table could take a significant amount of waiting, but overall an enjoyable meal."
"Taste-wise, only the prawn broth was something unique (but they only serve it in a small bowl that's not refillable, if you order the dry one). Everything else was meh & the sauce given was quite little. Overall, not worth $8 for the regular size & certainly not worth the looooooong wait in the heat... you'll have to wait a long time to get seats because everyone is waiting ages for their prawn mee. Beach road/Chinatown would definitely be more worth your time & cheaper too."
I love the broth. The only prawn noodles that doesnt make me feel dizzy or sleepy after finishing all the soup!
Big fresh prawn and qq noodles and rich broth
"The highlight of this prawn noodles has to be the broth
The soup is insanely flavourful, rich and intense
It's mildly sweet with a good balance of prawn taste and garlic. Noodles are chewy and the condiments with the fried shallots and pork lard is just right 
I got the $5 one and although it looked small, it did fill me up decently for breakfast.
Truly a comforting bowl of goodness! Finished the whole bowl till the last drop 
Have to get the large size next time round  Highly recommended "
Crowded as usual by 1330 hrs all sold out .
Nice prawn and pork rib noodles. Great coffee shop ambience!
"3 pieces big prawn noodle costs $15 and $5 for the liver soup. It's The expensive. The service was good. The taste was okay, not too impressed."
Great broth and good prawns. The soup given is quite minimum but quality justifies
"How we arrived at the 3 stars - Love the authentic and thick prawn broth. The noodles were on the softer side. The pork lard helped with delivering a strong flavour. However, we were a underwhelmed by how little the ingredients (2 medium prawns sliced in halved) at a local coffeeshop were for SGD 8. The service staff appeared lethargic and forgot our change, we certainly didn't remember to tell him to keep the change. Hopefully, the next time we return, Da Dong can up its value and service."
"Happy to que if there is a system. Asking me to wait whilst accepting orders from others who were not in que, just not for me."
Attracted to the queue for the prawn noodles. Good noodles and the broth is good.
"Deeply flavoured and well-seasoned soup with really well-cooked prawns - especially the big ones, which are excellent."
"Delicious noodles, broth and prawns! I can understand why this place is so popular."
"You can't miss out on one of the best prawn noodles in Singapore! There's always a queue at this place, and it's no wonder why - they constantly sell out before closing time. Trust me, I've missed out a few times myself.

My go-to order is the dry pork rib and prawn noodle. The noodles are cooked to perfection, with just the right level of spiciness. And let's talk about the soup - it's mind-blowing! No soup refills, but once you taste it, you'll understand why. Prepare to have your taste buds tantalized!"
Tasty. But soup is not as hot as I wished. Starts at $8; not cheap
"My second favourite prawn noodles in SG.

Kway teow is very well cooked, still has a slightly springy texture and does not feel like mush. The soup and noodles are flavourful but their servings could be slightly improved for the price that you're paying. And sadly, they do not provide soup refills."
Food was very good and looked good to it was amazing
Da Dong prawn noodle is good breakfast hangout in Joo chiat neighbourhood. Usually sell out before 12pm.
"Excellent Prawn noodles in Joo Chiat, East side of Singapore."
"It's an old establishment but it's quite disappointing comparing to the other established prawn noodle.

Queue: the ordering is quite slow and you order and seat. Payment is upon server.

Food: ordered Bee Hoon Mee dry and the yellow noodle is over cook yet the mixture of noodles are dry and clumped together. Very disappointing. The Chili is lighter taste.

I did notice the stall are ran by the younger generation which might contribute to the lack of taste and quality of food compared with the older generation."
Soup was good but noodles was average. Bad attitude.
The prawn broth .. just awesome
"Very good prawn noodles. Ranked among the best I have tried in Singapore.

Soup is thick and not too salty.

The liver was fresh and tender.

Only complain was that the queue was slow."
Very decent prawn noodles
"I was eating the wanton noodle.
I hv seen patrons slurping and munching
The prawns fm da dong. The noodles looks good. I be back for it. To join the
QUEUE."
"Delicious and prawn is fresh! Chilli and soup is great taste (soup non-refillable) price starting $8. Recommend to go during weekdays lunch, usually sold out by 2pm and weekend."
Very very very awesome prawn noodles. A pity they don't refill soup.
"This prawn noodle stall has been raved about in recent years by many food influencers. Not cheap and the broth is given out in portions that are barely enough (and you can't ask for refill).
It's a good bowl of prawn noodles but are there better PN stalls -- even within a 2km radius in Katong, I think there are better makers of this dish."
"Overall 4/5
Tasty but pitty a lot of dishes are sold out "
I think the best prawn noodle in the world to me. The later you go the thicker the broth gets. But might end up with then running out to pork ribs though.
"Recommended to this gem along Katong area, and went for it for my breakfast the very next day 

Opens at 7:30am, it was already sporting a queue of food to be served, with many patrons (including myself) seated and waiting before it even starts.

 I went with their recommendation, which was the yellow noodles and soup variant - and it was truly a comforting bowl of goodness. The broth is decently flavoured, not too rich but yet has a prawn note to it. Portions were okay, gotten the $8 one and although it looked small, it did fill me up pretty good - there's also a decent serving of meat slices to go with the 4 fresh prawns too.

Looking at the crowd and regulars here, it is no wonder why this unassuming prawn noodle store here is the favourite of many - a true comforting meal "
5 star rating for the deliciously smelling and tasting prawn noodles. It was like going back in time to our favourite Katong stall for honest to goodness noodles. The broth is heavenly!
"Da Dong's prawn noodle is very flavourful as expected. Love their $10 portion of prawn noodles. Personally would recommend the pork rib prawn, dry, as the soup is more concentrated and thick as compared to the soup version of prawn noodle.

Be early and you will not be disappointed."
Always the go to place for my Prawn Noodle craving.
Above average. Go for the prawn pork ribs dry noodles with soup on the side. Utterly satisfying especially on a rainy day.
"Ordered the dry prawn bihun kway tiao.
$8 per bowl for the regular.
Pricing here is of higher range as your prawn size is slightly bigger (cut into halves)

Soup tastes of big prawns, small prawns and pork ribs (all in one). So the soup is of sweeter version with bit of saltiness to it.
Some may describe it as clear and not as flavourful.
Noodles are below average taste as it's doesn't have much flavour to it despite all the ingredients in that bowl.

Service and ordering system was a nightmare as they might forget your order till you asked them. They won't say sorry if they forget your order. You just wait for them to serve you next.

Part of the reason why always long queue because ordering system is a mess."
"I wonder who gave this stall 5 stars. Please, for the regular $8 bowl, it's daylight robbery, so little, and the soup is so watery, nowhere near any prawn noodle soup i have eaten. The one located next block is better. No, thank you. Gave it a try today for the first time and definitely last time for me.

0 star from me."
Broth is really good. Noodles could be a tad tastier but overall not bad
"Ordered the big prawn noodles and I felt that their standards dropped. Prawns were mushy, noodles over cooked and the soup lack flavour. Disappointing. Been here a few times before and I thought they were good...but sadly not anymore. There are better prawn noodles out there."
Awesome prawn noodle soup the chili/soy sauce really makes it come alive
Very nice dry prawn noodle but at high cost.
If you love prawn noodle this place is a must. Soup has depth and flavour. Order big prawns. Love it dry with soup and extra ribs on side
Hands down the best prawn noodles I've ever had. Try the pig liver and intestines if you like organs.
"Really yummy, must try."
"Not my 1st visit but I wasn't expecting it's so expensive now. Understand things gone expense since this is just coffee shop setting, The prawn noodle standard drop a little but for $5 the amount serve is too little but it's not just that, it's not hot enough n the service attitude not as pleasant.. don't think I will patronise again"
One of my favourite prawn mee spots. Dry yellow mee. Best.
"One of the best prawn noodles in Singapore. There is always a queue at this place and it appears to always sell out before its designated closing time....I know I have missed the cut a few times.

I always get the dry pork rib and prawn noodle. The noodles are well cooked and have a good level of spiciness. The soup is insanely flavoured.... They don't give soup refills and its quite understandable when you try it.

Worth the queue. But come before 12 or you will likely miss out."
"Strong prawn and thick broth will come to my mind when it comes to good prawn noodle soup. But this soup base is light and does have a slight hinge of prawn flavour and I do like it.
The only setback for me is i cannot ask for top up of soup.
So soup lovers beware."
"Love it, an authentic Prawn Noodles in Singapore. Very recommended, good taste and fair price."
Top best prawn mee noodles in Singapore
Very yummy. The soup is tasty and not overpowering. 
Great prawn noodles! Broth is flavorful and delicious.
Best prawn mee in singapore
"Was around the area and saw a short queue. Without much thoughts quickly jump into the queue. Waited 15 mins around 10.30am. Ordered pork ribs and prawn noodles, normal size. Liver soup sold out and I opted for intestines soup. The broth is good. Abit sweet and more porky rather than prawn flavour. I am more leaning towards heavy prawns broth. Noodles are well cooked. Pork ribs are normal, a bit to small. Intestines are well cooked and cleaned. $8+$5 total. I would rate it as above average pricing, small quantity. Not my best choice."
"Used to be the best prawn noodles but no longer has consistency. Prices went up, portions down, that I can understand. But noodles are sometimes over cooked and the broth no longer as punchy as before. Last few visits were erratic in quality. I still visit the coffee shop but switched to the amazing wonton noodles. I do hope Da dong will improve to its original standard."
Best prawn noodles in Singapore
"Love the prawn mee. They gave a soup on the side, thick and yummy!"
"This is a joke of all prawn mee. The soup is lacking of flavour, the cooking is super slow, and definitely not value for money. Go elsewhere and chances are you will find better prawn mee that beats this stall hands down."
"Easily comparable, if not better than your big name prawn noodles. Have been patronizing them for 30 yrs and never disappoints even after handing down to 2nd generation. Come early as they tend to sell out by noon or 1230."
The best prawn mee in SG!
"This must be one of the most puzzling food mysteries in Sg. Standards dropping. Unworthy of the long queues to fill your calories. Atrocious that for a small bowl, you gave a puny little prawn and few strips of meat fitting for a dog's meal. Soup given were barely a few spoonful. Terrible, how do you survive with such stingy boss mindset? Better go for the stall beside selling wanton noodles. This is a genuine post."
Worthy to wait for the 30mins.
"One of the most well balanced prawn noodles in Singapore, with just the right amount of depth. Portion is a little small but just nice for a breakfast treat"
This is a very mediocre bowl of prawn noodles. I'm not sure why it has fans. The broth is so disappointing - the colour makes it look rich but it just tastes like plain pork broth with a hint of prawn. $10 for this is also incredibly pricey for just 2 prawns (halved so it looks like 4) and a few pork ribs.
"Was recommended, so we went down to try... ordered the pork rip prawn noodle...thick soup but abit plain...pork meat abit hard..so so only..."
"Arrive at 7:15am on a Saturday morning to try Da Dong prawn noodle, our first visit, at Joo Chiat.

Stall opens for business at 7:30am but surprisingly, several regulars already there were served with their bowls of noodles, while newbies like us have to queue behind these ""invisible customers""!

We ordered 2 bowls, prawn and ribs dry noodles and regular prawn noodle soup. Comes with bean sprouts, kangkong, pork lard bits, $8 each. Prawns served were fresh, sweet,  halved and deshelled.

The ribs are small but cooked just right - almost falling off the bones, succulent and tasty. I dare say these are the best ribs I had from a prawn noodle stall in Singapore.

Both the soup as well as dry noodle mix have their unique taste unlike others in Singapore.

They also offer pork liver, pork intestines, pig tail soup, big prawn noodles as well.

History of stall dates back to the 60s, now run by 2 young chap and an auntie, who takes orders and serving, all very friendly.

Definitely a must try for prawn noodle fans. Long queue started to form at 7:55am. Closes on Tuesday, we tried visiting on a Fri about 1:30pm, they were already sold out.

Limited tables and seating capacity."
"Sweet soft pork ribs and nice prawn soup. Dry type has a good balance sweet and chilli paste to it. Soup is not too thick, just nice. Always sold out during lunch time."
"Old school prawn noodle that is really popular... long queue!
Rich prawn soup, savoury noodle lathered with mixture of fried shallot oil and lard! Strands of kang kong completed the old school feel.
Really nice bowl of prawn noodle, not overly rich like some stalls... just right for me.
Seats are limited at this corner coffeeshop, directly opposite the open surface carpark."
"Heard so much of this place and decided to give a try.

Had the dry version $10, it was a little bland for my liking, the sauce doesn't has the punch for me. Soup was tad salty and lack prawny flavor.

Might not be on my go to list for prawn noodle."
"The soup lacked prawn flavour, the noodles was a tad dry with very lil chilli & sauces. I had to add some soup to the noodles and there wasn't much soup too. I've had better, yummier prawn noodles elsewhere, with more flavourful soup, noodles with sufficient chilli/sauces + fatter prawns at cheaper prices. Once is enuff."
Nice prawn noodle and price slightly on high side $8
My go to for prawn noodles
"Truly mind-boggling how many people rate this so highly and so many people actually queue up for it. This tastes like if a superb prawn mee seller passed it down to his son, and then that guy passed it down to HIS son who actually has very little interest in being a cook. That's what you get here. Super disappointing trip down east for this."
"Best prawn mee I had in my life. Everything was perfect - from the umami broth, to the yellow noodles that were not alkaliney, tender pork ribs and fresh prawns. Craving for it even the next day."
"This is a slightly different style compared to the blanco court, Jalan Sultan prawn prawn noodles which has a darker and heavier tasting broth. Price is slightly higher than what I would normally expect but the food surely won't have you feeling short changed after the meal."
Umami broth and not overpowering. Love the pig intestines with very good flavours and was cleaned well.
Food is delicious. Always order pork ribs with kway teow. Soup tastes so much better with that.
Not really like it
"Pretty nice noodles with thick prawny broth. Queues can be long depending on timing and your luck.  Price for a small bowl is $8 but the prawns are largish.

Pair it with a bowl of wonton noodles from the stall next door and you are in noodles heaven."
"Ordered (1) Big prawn + pork rib, dry, $15 (2) Normal prawn + pork rib, soup $10. With such reputation and price point I must say that the soup was lacklustre, missing the usual umami flavoured broth but it does comes with a unique porky-sweetness. Condiments mix for the dry version is more to the sweet ketchup-y side with a modest portion of pork lard and shallots - kind of a miss for me. Pork ribs, on the other hand was tender and flavourful, a solid 5 for this. Big prawns not as fresh as I'd like it to be.

To be honest would've bump it up to a 3-star if the price point was a little more complementing to its taste. I believe one would expect slightly more for a $15 bowl. Then again, taste is subjective and individualistic. May still come back to try the intestine soup!"
The last time I had the prawn mee here was about a decade ago. I'm a bit disappointed when I had it yesterday. It's pretty unimpressive. Soup was a tad salty and lack of the oomph.
"The taste is not as nice as it was before and I don't think it is worth queuing 45mins for a bowl of prawn mee.

Service is not too bad just that I feel they do things a little too slowly and hence the long wait. (just my personal opinion).

If you are trying, do expect to wait for a long time unless it is during the weekdays."
"Rainy cool mornings will get me seeking for a bowl of hot soup. There seems to be a shortage on good prawn mee stalls, but there is for sure no shortage on prawn mee lovers. This place located in the corner of Marshall Lane and Joo Chiat Road is no exception. With long queues and limited amount of space. People will still line up to get a hit of this delicious bowl. Broth is aromatic and packs a punch without being overpowering. Noodles are chewy and the condiments with the fried shallots and pork lard is just right. If you are around the area stop by and grab a bowl. Service is fantastic and plenty of parking across the street."
"It's been a while since I've tried this again. Came here at around 10am and was delighted to see a queue cause it must still be good right? I was so wrong. Just to order (not even collect cash or pick up food), the queue was 20 mins....

A bowl of regular prawn mee was $8!!! Thought the portion size would be more than a normal hawker Centre $5 bowl. When it came, we were so disappointed. The soup barely covered the noodles, the portion size was very small, only had 4 half slices of prawn and maybe 3 thin slices of pork. For the dry version, all we tasted was sweet ketchup for the chilli sauce. It wasn't spicy at all. The soup was also just sweet, can tell they add a lot of sugar. And not much prawn taste. Also a very small portion of noodles and a tiny bowl of soup. Soup is non refillable either.

All for $8 per bowl, totally not worth it. Even taste is not fantastic, just remembered that it's sweet. This however is my opinion after trying it so you can still try it for yourself if you want~"
"Delicious broth, price very reasonable. This and beach road prawn noodles are the best imo."
"Soup is savoury, dried noodles taste on healthy side. Good option"
"My friend had recommended this place. I had the dry pork rib prawn kuay teow mee. As reviewed by many, the prawn noodle was delicious, although the broth was good, it was veey little. The pork ribs were hard which I didn't quite enjoy. We ordered an extra bowl of large prawn."
Niceand he prepares it very systematically too and there were many customers. It closes early so it is not a stall which opens full day
Prawn Noodle soup is so tasteless . & It so damn overprice costing at $8 for a small one  . Nothing special about the soup.
"The highlight of this prawn noodles was the broth. It's mildly sweet with a good balance of prawn taste and slightly garlicky. I particularly love the thickness of the soup. Each bowl of prawn noodles came with a spoon of pork lard, yummy!!! Some people may find this unhealthy; for me, it's just a monthly treat. I relished each scoop of the noodles with the broth. The prawns were fresh, and the service was good. Two young lads and the owner served this delicious bowl of comfort food to me. Bravo!!!

Would I go back again? Definitely!!! But, take note, the shop closes early (usually before 1 pm) and the waiting time is at least 30 minutes."

"Queued for full 50 min. Both the prawn broth and sambal chilli are good. However, ask me if worth the queue, honestly no. What irked me was the cooking area was messy and dirty."
"Back to my favourite prawn noodle place. Another happy meal. Everything was awesome and consistent, including price (that has not been changed for years). Definitely one of the best prawn noodle in Singapore. Highly recommended for both locals and visitors."
"It was good but not long queue nor ""no extra soup deal with it"" good"
"Nostalgic prawn noodles soup. Soup was tasty with pork ribs and prawns.

Was dabao-ing back to eat at home, I stood in front of the stall for a good 5 - 8 mins before the young man in the stall ask me what I wanted. The other two outside 'pretended' I was not there.. sigh...."
"Love the seasoning of the dry prawn noodles. Nostalgic taste of chilli mix with ketchup that gives it a tang. Ingredients were fresh; the pork ribs fell off the bone when we picked it up, prawns were cooked to perfection. The soup had a nice umami but unfortunately non refillable (good things are cooked in small batches right?) Mixture of shallots oil and pork lard were fresh. The owner puts in a tremendous amount of effort and takes pride in their food.

We were lucky there wasn't a queue at 9am but the queue formed when we were about to finish.

This comforting bowl of noodles would definitely take a trip down memory lane for most locals.."
"Be prepared for long queue for this hawker stall. The order system goes like this:
1. Queue (suggest to find a seat before that, and you can share table)
2. Wait for your turn and place your order
3. Go back to your table and wait
4. The stall will serve your food to you
5. Pay and eat

I had big prawn, pork bone, and pig tail for my proteins. The prawns are very fresh and tasty. As for the porks, they are very tender.

For the carbs, I had bee hoon / yellow noodle and kway teow / yellow noodle. My personal favourite is kway teow. The fried shallots, sambal, spring onions and garlic really complement

Don't get me started on the soup. It's packed with umami. However they are very stingy on soup, so savour every drop of it."
"I came here for two stalls given rave reviews in this coffee shop. This is one of it. Thumbs up to the freshness of the ingredients and the mastery of skills to whip up every bowl of this local delicacy. However, it is somewhat disappointing to be honest given the expectation and anticipation and travel here. The soup lacks that robust and flavourful prawny taste, much like what you would expect from a nice bowl of rich tonkotsu ramen."
"What a wonderful bowl of prawn noodles. One of the best I had. They were closing but the smiley polite owner obliged. Everything was done right - portion, freshness of ingredients and the soup. I slurped every bit of the umami well balanced soup. My only complain is not enough haha."
"Finally make it here to try Da Dong Prawn noodles and understand the hype. The broth is to die for. Flavourful, rich and intense. Owner is very friendly n the portions are big. Thank you for keeping up the tradition!"
Overrated prawn noodle. The soup - very little of it - had no taste of prawn. Just a generic soup. It was ok to eat as a dish but not really prawn noodle. And at $8 for hawker fare it is totally not worth it. Don't waste your time queueing.
The stall owner was very stingy on giving the soup and I feel it is expensive as compared to other notable prawn noodle stalls in terms of taste and portion.
"Went early in the morning and there was already a queue. The queue became much longer at 9am onwards. Ordered the $10 soup version without pork ribs. Delicious and consistent quality so far. Good broth and it is one of best prawn mee in Singapore. On the pricey side, but worth the price and trip (I stay in the west)."
My weekly fix - it's an addiction. The broth is the best I've tried and the pork ribs are deliciously tender. Can't get enough!
Delicious pawn noodle
One of the best prawn noodle I had tasted with strong umami soup base. Highly recommended. Downside is on the price and soup unable to refill.
"Founded in 1966, one of the oldest prawn noodle shop in Singapore."
"First time trying this prawn noodle. Came by Monday around 11am expecting a crowd. Surprisingly there's no queue and it came pretty fast after seated nice and windy area. Was expecting something great given the rave reviews, but it's just not the likes of Macpherson, JalanSultan or Loyang. the soup is not flavourful enough, a bit on salty side for me. The ribs are not tender enuf and prawns are small for large bowl. The sambal is pretty good though - mellow spiciness and yet flavourful taste. But it's really a very average bowl of prawn soup."
"Love the noodles! Need to go early if not sold out.
Highly recommend!"
Was lucky and managed to order their last bowl of prawn noodle soup for the day at 12.50pm! Had to wait around 10 mins for my order (take away) and enjoyed it - the prawns were juicy and the soup was well seasoned. The guy cooking was very friendly and I can see why people return here. Only thing is I thought the portion was a little small for $8.
"Delicious prawn noodles with hearty broth. Hope that we get more soup served, or maybe its just their technique to get you to come back for more."
Really have to go early if you want to get a bowl of this delicious prawn noodle. The broth is rich and unami. Usually sold out by 12.30pm to 1pm.
"To be honest. Quite average.

Prefer the Beach Road shop instead."
"Good tasty soup base, generous ingredients :)  only thing to endure was the super long queue... 45mins, on a Sunday afternoon"
Used to be bak ku teh in this kpt. Change to sell prawn noodle.  Thier  Pork rib is tender. Thier broth was prep better  than outside..not like msg soup
The broth! Once you've tasted it you'll know why so many people consider this the King of prawn noodles!
One of the best prawn noodles... unfortunately the q is always long and we often have to wait for 30-45mins.. well I guess some things worth queuing
Auntie attitude has problems...
the reason for their popularity is lost on me. $10 bowl of beehoon/kway teow prawn mee was subpar. the nearby chainstore prawn mee is nicer or go further down the road. take your money and empty tummy elsewhere
Very good. More soup pls!
"I had prawn mee yesterday. I ordered an extra set of pork rib soup with mee. The queue was quite long after a while and the wait for my food was very long. The food was good. The soup was savoury, but not to the point that it makes you thirsty. I wish the food portion was a bit more though. Overall a good experience."
I think it's just slightly above average. Gd try!
"27 Feb 2022: Ordered two bowls of the $10 Prawn Noodles (Large)...fresh prawn, soup is rich, flavorful and has a tinge of herbal. My preference is the dry version; the chilli and sauces combination is just awesome to give you the kick and the crispy lard is super shiok too. A little pricey but you pay for the quality and surprisingly, we didn't have to wait long for our noodles (under 15 minutes)"
Not worth the long queue at all.
"Soup based is nicest I have tried, very gor zha taste (nostagia). Portion is small, even the large $10 bowl comes with limited pork rib and prawn compared Beach Road Prawn Noodles but it is the quality that counts. Thought if they can offer more soup will be good."
For a small bowl which cost $8 the least we expect from them is some basic cleaning on the prawn intestinal.. quite decent soup base if you not particular with the prawn intestinal tract.
"Taste: excellent. I ordered a regular prawn noodles with good Portions of freshly peeled half prawns and pork. Also ordered an additional Portion of pig tails soup which was quite little but the amount of soup was satisfactory. Slurped up every single bit.

Service: gooood. It's a one man show. He is polite and takes your orders then serves you at the table with chilli and the necessary utensils.

Price: comparable to other good prawn noodles.

I will be back! Thankfully it's not a Tuesday cos it's closed and after 4pm probably sold out so don't bother to go for dinner."
Pretty decent option in the neighbourhood. Large portions. Prawns are big. Be prepared for long Q.
"Delicious prawn noodles, very tasty soup.  Certainly worth the 30 min wait"
Overall it's a good bowl of prawn noodles. Good to see a new generation helming it. Noodles flavours is a 3-3.5 stars. The soup is a 4 stars. It's different and better than that you get from nearby Beach Road Prawn noodles. Definitely a worthy choice.
"I would rate it 3.5.  The only good thing about it is the broth, which is flavorful.  My suggestions for improvement include: (a) more prawns and ribs (my $10 bowl only has 4 halved prawns and 5 small pieces of ribs.) (b) bigger pieces of ribs would give better chew and taste less blenched. (c) if you want to halve the prawns, then remove the veins.  Otherwise, leave the whole prawn intact.  For regular size prawns I alway prefer not to halve them to maintain the crunchiness.  (d) more sauce for the noodles.  Having said all these, I might be back for the broth."
"You may have read the recent interview Bloomberg did with young hawker @watsonspacelim who'd shared how he quit his high-flying job as an equities broker to take over his father's hawker business and carry on his legacy. Well, I think he has done his late dad very proud because I feel Da Dong Prawn Noodles tastes as good as, if not better these days.
The stall is probably most renowned for its incredible broth a.k.a. ""elixir of life which can be a contentious point for some because there isn't exactly plenty of it, nor can one ask for extra. But perhaps that's what adds to its covetable factor. Personally, I am simply over the moon with whatever is served.
My order has pretty much remained the same for a while - a $10 portion of Beehoon Mee Dry (the housemade savoury sambal is very fragrant, not too spicy and shiok) with tender Pork Ribs, cooked-just-right Liver and sometimes, depending on my mood and if it's available, Pig's Intestines. Once in a while, I swing to the soupy side just for a change of scene.
If you plan on visiting, do note they are closed on Tuesdays and whenever Watson or any of his crew have reservist duty."
One of the best prawn noodles. My all time fav one is the prawn noodle at cambridge market. This prawn noodle from Da Dong comes very close. Its soup is one of those clear ones unlike the other darker colour prawn noodle soup. Definately will be back again on a weekday where there is lesser queue and could get a table easily.
Love the prawns mee.
"I have given this prawn noodles 3 tries this year and in my opinion, this is not great prawn noodles. My 4 stars are for the soup alone, which is shiok. 3 stars for everything else. Having eaten countless times the beach road and old airport road variety (nearby), I may be too spoilt to consider this one worthy of another visit. This here is just normal standard coffee shop prawn noodles but over priced. It is not at all bad, it is decent, but not great. That's that."
"Came by on a Sunday afternoon, was one of the lucky few who got the last few bowls before they sold out.

Service was fairly prompt, but waiting for the food to arrive took awhile as they were preparing orders that came before us.

Priced at $8 a bowl for the regular size, I must say I was quite disappointed as the noodles came in a very small portion. Was overall well seasoned with bits of lard. The soup was the star of the show. Thick and well-bodied, nothing but flavor.

I didn't have some but my partner who had the pork ribs said it tasted like bak kut teh.

My only gripe would be the price as I feel like there are others in the area that could match the flavor and taste at a lower price. No doubt the soup was great, perhaps they could have bigger portion of noodles.

Overall would recommend only if you are in the area, but do go early."
"Sub par service, long wait, below average bowl of noodles.85% Noodles, 10% ingredients, and 5% soup. Extremely overpriced and totally not worth. This was $8. Definitely 0 star and will never visit again."
Great prawn noodles. Rich and flavourful.
"Too pricy, taste no better than others. Soup is nice. Service quality is below average. Worst is the queue system, if you know them, you don't need to queue and gets priority."
"Very terrible experience. Bad service attitude (rude replies to polite questions, 1 pair of chopsticks for 2 bowls of noodles) and overpriced food ($10 for small portion). No queue system, where the stall owner allows people she knows to cut queue."
Can eat.. but very Expensive!!!

"I ordered the Big Prawn noodle, dry version. The noodle is well balanced - not too salty or spicy with the aroma of fried pork lard. The soup is one of the best I've had. That's why I always order the dry version to taste the soup in it's original form."
"First time try this famous stall. Expect long queue mostly start from 10am onwards. The first sip tasted that soup is so creamy. The rest is kinda of similar with others. Ordered the largest prawn cost 20 dollar perbowl, not the largest prawn, but quite big."
Operated by a few youngster. Broth not bad but not as good as many other prawn noodle stalls around in Singapore. Price is quite high not as value for $. Attitude a bit haolian. Ask for a little more broth give an ugly face.
"I can say it's nothing special and not worth the queue at all.

The soup was not as flavourful as I thought. Even any prawn noodle stall have the same soup base.

The portion was unreasonably small compare to the price given.

The serving speed was very slow when we went down on a Monday morning and there wasn't any queue. However, we waited almost 20 mins for the noodle to be cooked.

Definitely will not go back. Even the Beach Road prawn noodle is better. Cheaper price, short queue plus better taste."
"The soup is very flavourful & very ""thick""!! The $8 Pork rib Prawn Noodle serving size is a bit small for me....."
That was good but unfortunately they run out of pork ribs after 1pm so you really have to come early and a bit pricey
Prawn noodles slightly above average but very stingy with the soup. It barely covered my noodles.
Best prawn noodles place in sg. No alkaline taste in the noodles and the broth is perfect too. Unable to refill the soup unfortunately and it's so good. Price a bit high. $8 for a bowl
"Exquisite soup...if you don't have anything else, must have the unami soup that takes hours of magical mix of pork, bones and prawn shells."
Very nice Soup. You don't feel thirsty after drinking it
"I went today to try this  popular prawn noodles.  Here is my personal experience
1.  The order taking is systematic and good - at least not messy
2.  The waiting time ( I arrive ard 11.38am and was served 12.09pm).  30 mins partly the food preparation somehow a bit slower than typical prawn noodles sellers.  I still can accept it.
3.  They are very stingy with soup.  When you order noodle soup, the soup that comes with the noodle didnt even cover the noodles in the bowl.  That is how stingy the serving is.  Maybe because we only order $5 per bowl.
4.  For $5, you will only get 1 small prawn and 3 small slices of  pork with tow gay and that's it.
5.  I also ordered take away 3 packets.  For takeaway, min order is $8 per packet.  Again soup given was miserable.  When I reached home, the soup didnt even fill up 3/4 of my normal coffee cup!
6. The whole lunch cost me $34 and that is not cheap consider the time travelled and waiting time.
Finally,  I have been eating prawn noodles since whitley road  flyover prawn noodles back in the 80s and since then many other so called popular stalls.  So this stall is OKAY but definitely nothing to ""wow"" about. I wont go back for sure because I can find many other equally good if not better places to eat prawn noodles for example Blk 704 Bedok reservoir."
"The service was great as i have a small child, they served the bowl of noodle to our table, the prawn soup was thick just a bit less of the soup. The price is a bit hight for thin slices of prawns. We finished all very nicely :)"
"Reminds me of why i like sg so much, good cheap food, guy serving also very polite"
"Nice prawn mee manned by two young chaps. The missing star is due to the pricing, a tad too expensive for a bowl of noodles."
Go before 10.30am to get it before they are sold out. However it's not really worth the wait and queue for this. Above average.
Good but expensive
"It's a solid 4 star. 4.5 if I can give just because the price of $10 a bowl just doesn't go well with many. But if you take it as ramen standard then yes this is our very own Singapore prawn ramen! You don't call it a soup you call it a broth. The soup is definitely the best I've tried. There's no fake brown colour and it's translucent meaning there are a lot of time into the broth making. Maybe that's why they are quite stingy on the soup.

I ordered the $10 bowl w pork ribs. It's more ribs than two halved mid sized prawns. V nice. Chilli thinly sliced and soy sauce is well balanced! Overall it's worth a try but not often I'll go for it as there are many options out there w the yummy experience close to this or even similar but priced $4-6. If you haven't you have to try it."
Definitely the best in Joo Chiat! Make sure u try it....NICE!!!
"Oh this elusive prawn noodles.. da dong doesn't have a social page so it's always a guess if they are operating or have sold out for the day.
Go early to avoid any disappointment! I think before 10:30am is a good time to shoot for. Buffer in a 30-min wait because it's worth it.

I loved my dry version - the chilli's good and saltiness is on point.
The prawn broth that comes with the dry noodles is what my time is well-spent on. I didn't think the prawns were anything to shout about, but those pork ribs.. well done!

Yes, there's no refill of the soup which irks many, but credit needs to be given to Watson for the hours spend coaxing out the flavours from his ingredients and I think it's a fair limiting factor.

The small, is really tiny ($5). I always go for the medium bowl ($8) which overfills me a little but I think it's a good size to start the day!"
Tasty. Price is high for a coffeeshop stall but soup is serious and addictive.
Succulent jumbo prawns in a delightfully rich broth. Rather unique in that their soup has a very similar body and consistency as some of the best Tonkotsu in Tokyo.
"Fresh prawns, fast serving. Soup portion a bit too little"
"Come early - we came here at 1120 on a sat and got one of the last few bowls! The soup is sweet, rich and absolutely delicious. Noodles were okay IMO, nothing special, but the soup was totally worth it :)"
Heard a lot about this place and decided to give it a go. The prawn soup is really powerful. It's umami packed and it is as though you are drinking prawns.
"My go to place for a prawn noodle fix!
Balanced flavors and thick (limited) soup!"
"Their soup broth is full of umami and body and probably that's why they priced themselves expensive

Will stick back to Joo Chiat Pl :-)"
Gui You Bu Hao Chi
Simoly the best
Delicious food.
"Soup is rich and nice, with some slight herb aftertaste hence its unique. This is the 10 dollar prawn only portion, feel expensive for the amount paid but finally got a chance to try this few days ago."
"Finally tried Da Dong prawn noodles  which has been raved by many foodies like @veronicaphua  I got the dry version as you get the best of both worlds - chilli mix and the rich pork prawn broth  overall, I would say the broth is definitely with the hype   the soup is packed with unami rich thick aroma of the prawn base yet still relatively clear and not overly starchy when paired with the chilli tossed noodles - the spice goes well with the smooth thickly flavored broth - Abit like eating tsukemen ! I do have to say the price is bit steep for the quantity ( no soup refill sad) but worth a visit and well deserved praises for the soup

Check @nomninjas on Instagram for more:)"
seriously the best prawn noodle i ever had. the broth is thick and strong without being overwhelming. its not cheap but i like they have the small bowl which iike for lunch. full 5 stars if not for the only big drawback - the lack of seats and long wait.
Pretty rude young guy back faced us and did not even bother to inform that they are sold out.
"Hao Chi Bu Guo Tang You Dian Shao, very delicious but can give us more broth pls."
Great prawn noodles.  The broth is so good!  Totally worth it.  Go early to avoid the crowds
"With the cheapest prawn noodle option coming at $8, its price is higher compared to other big name prawn noodle stalls.
The taste is decent but there's noticeable hint of pepper that is not my preferred taste.
In my opinion, it is overpriced."
"This prawn noodle probably has the most tasty & delicious soup in Singapore. Usually sold out by 1pm. Ever went there on a Sunday morning at 10:30am, and was sold out. Original owner has passed the trade to his son, now the stall is run by young hawkers. Still very good.
Even if you order the dry version, soup is still very limited & no refill.
Ingredients are very traditional type. They don't have jumbo prawns like some other stalls."
The noodle was cooked to al dente standard. Soup was great.
Enjoyed the soup  it's just simple and favourful! Be prepare to q 
"Prawn noodles with authentic taste, good ingredients, and a tasty prawn soup"
The best prawn mee ever. I ate this almost every week :)
"Tried it once w soup and didn't like it - the broth tastes like lobster / prawn bisque and is very concentrated, didn't go so well with noodles in them. For soup noodles, I would go somewhere else.

However! Tried the dry kway teow and it's so fragrant tossed with the pork lard & oil - love that beautiful bowl of noodles. The small accompanying bowl of prawn broth shot was delicious, and you can tell it took lots of labour to get that thick concentrated essence. Thumbs up for the bowl of silky kway Teow, fragrant pork lard, and soup!

The prawns and ribs were not strong sidekicks. pork ribs were a little tough, not sure if overcooked or could use Ruan Gu/ soft ribs instead. The prawns were 3 thin, half slices so about 1.5 prawn for a $8 bowl - feels like could have been more, but I will be happy to upsize to $10 bowl to support a young hawker business passionate about good food. Minor detail as I noticed some black prawn poo in the crevices, would be good to clean them thoroughly."
"Rich, thick and flavourful broth, packs a lot of flavour in it. Prawns were fresh and gives off a very nice sweet taste to compliment the noodles. Ox tail soup and pigs liver were fantastic. Cleaned very well and cooked perfectly as well. Highly recommend the dry version! One of the best prawn noodles I've eaten!"
"Came at Friday afternoon 12 ish and waited ard 20 plus mins before food arrived

Ordered the big prawn $13. It's abit sad that the soup is only half bowl (w all the ingredient) but I would have to say the broth is very flavourful n delicious. The prawn given is also very generous portion though a wee bit not fresh (meat stick to shell n abit mushy )

Also they don't give chilli powder but chilli flakes so taste abit diff and they only have big chilli instead of chilli padi. As a spicy lover, this meal lacks the spiciness to bring it ot next level.

Would give 5 stars if not for the soup portion n chilli padi/chilli powder

Recommend to come try still. Worth the drive."
Very Nice base soup and pork sliced thinly not frozen really nice Prawn mee soup Die Die must try loving it every scoop. Go Today and try...
"Really good bowl of prawn noodle minus the chilli oil sauce etc. Simplicity at its best. If u want some spice can add the chilli powder provided. The unami-filled soup is full of flavour, though only a small bowl is given (no extra serving is available). The liver is soft and it is drizzled with sesame oil soya sauce with coriander and lard. Delicious! Pig tail is very Q and not the soft mushy type. Love it!"
Wasn't as nice as before.
"Came here early at 9am. Limited tables. The $8 prawn noodle is pretty small, but the broth is good. Takes quite long to get your food"
Great but ex.
"Decided to come here after hearing some good reviews. Arrived at about 1pm and they were already almost fully sold out. Managed to snag one of the last few bowls.

This is the $8 version which is the cheapest. The broth was definitely the star of the show- extremely flavourful and rich. It kind of tasted like thick lobster bisque. The prawns were also fresh. However, the portion size was a little small at this price. With that said, I also don't think that the soup really went well with noodles. But don't be mistaken, the soup was good. Maybe I'll try the dry version the next time round instead."
Flavour is concentrated and impressively rich
"Order the dry version. Noodle in gravy was flavorful. Taste was just nice, not too salty. Enjoy the soup also with strong prawn taste.  A bit of waiting time on a sat morning like 15-30 mins. Recommended"
"Popular prawn place that some friends come regularly.

Order the largest $10 portions ($5, $8 available)

I ordered the Prawn Mee Dry Mee Pok and wife took the ribs abd prawn Bee Hoon soup.

Serving size is very small for $10.
Prawns are decent size (not small) but sliced in half. Maybe 3 prawns for mine and 1 prawn + ribs in the other.

Sad small bowl of prawn soup and please don't ask for more soup. They indicated ""cannot add soup"" but I asked anyway and they said they don't have ""enough soup"". 

But the soup is good and maybe that's why a bit ""atas"".

Go for soup based if you want more soup. The dry mee pok is average only and the soup too little.

Overall, taste is ok but serving size small for $10."
Quantity for price isn't the best. However fast and good prawn noodles in the area
One of the best prawn mee around Singapore. The soup base is awesome. Just that the portion and soup will be good if the portion is a little bit more. But overall still highly recommend to try.
Saw many foodies having this. Decided today to swing by early to try it during lunch time. A corner coffee shop with only 1 stall and everyone waiting or enjoying their prawn noodle. Ordered the $10 prawn noodles with pork ribs. Portion was decent and the soup was flavorful yet not tiring on the palate. The soup is probably the star of the dish. Unfortunately I made the mistake of ordering it with kway teow which means it was soaking up the soup. Next time I will definitely order the dry version so I can savory the soup.
Food is fine but very slow and worker touches food with bare hands. Waiting time up to 30mins even if there is not queue. A lot of regular customer placed their order on the side and got their food first.
Always a nice breakfast and great to see the second generation doing well.
Excellent soup but no topping up of soup
Good to.see young hawkers
Price is double of those in kopitiam/food centers of comparable portion. Super long wait of 50mins for one regular bowl ($8) and small bowl ($5). Disappointing because it's just mediocre.
"The best, and I say this having eaten here so regularly that a substantial portion of my dna is prawn itself.

My wife and I enjoy the Pork Rib Prawn noodle soup, the later you come, the thicker the soup gets in our opinion.

We get that there are prawn noodle places everywhere, but we prefer the thick broth, rich and strong taste of this particular prawn noodle. My own preference is yellow noodles and you can choose from a few different types.

This has been our most favourite place to eat for years and years. Their taste is very consistent and the family running the place are really lovely."
"One of the best prawn noodles I have eaten for breakfast. Short queue in early morning. The broth was so tasty, the ingredients cooked just right timing. It tasted better than it looked."
The prawn noodles soup is 1 of the best in Singapore. Don't be shocked by the prices because you are paying for good quality food.
"Didn't managed to eat their prawn noodles the last 2 visits as we were late. They sold out at approx 1215pm.

Finally got to try their noodles after my friend was raving about it.

The overall taste was great and I liked the broth. It was thicker than the usual and slightly sweet. Slightly pricier though."
Ordered the big portion $10 prawn and pork ribs but I guess the guy who took my order was so busy and got my order wrongly. The noodles were absolutely fabulous and fragrance. It is the kind that you can just eat it on its own without any other ingredients. Their ingredients and soup was just average. Visited at 12 pm on a weekend and I am lucky to get the last few bowls before they sold out. Saw couple of people who came after that and left disappointed due to sold out.
"Very fresh and nice soup base, chilli paste was awesome"
Decent noodles. Soup base is nice but not the very strong tasting kind but still surprisingly good
"They probably have the best prawn noodles in the East. Their noodles come with fresh vegetables, fried lard and slices of delicious pork. Unlike noodles served elsewhere, theirs is light tasting and somewhat refreshing. The soup is full-bodied and reminds me of my grandmother's cooking."
"Love it! They have amazing broth. Saw some reviews that say they are expensive, let's just say you have to pay for quality. I mean a plate of pasta is easily $20, why can't we pay more for good quality prawn noodles?"
"Not value for money.. with the price charge.... the soup portion just too small portion, and need to add money for extra soup.... "
Unique soup & seriously good wholesome fresh large pawns. For note there's no refills for soup and a regular big prawn bowl sets you back at $13.
Super flavourful soup with nice chilli mix for the dry noodles. Wait for table can be challenging
"Located along Joo Chiat road, this is a popular prawn noodle stall located in the corner coffee shop. There are small and big prawn options, with also liver, intestines as side dishes. The soup give is really quite stingy in volume but other than that it is enjoyable."
First time trying the regular portion is bit too small for the price given with 1 prawn which was cut into 2. Soup is more towards chicken soup with prawn flavour in it.
"Very good broth.

Edited : inconsistent broth base, some days it's more salty other days more bland."
"Giving this a 4-star because of its price, very expensive. Quality wise, it is absolutely delicious. The oil for the noodle is extremely fragrant, but I can't quite put a finger as to it's exact seasoning, maybe some pork and some sugar. The pork is very tender and juice. Also the prawns have been de-shelled. The soup is thick and sweet."
"Noodle has strong alkaline taste, soup given is very little. Prawn is fresh"
"Food very nice.
They are Very friendly.

Must clean the table immediately."
"Love their dry chilli mee poh, which comes with pork liver, peeled prawns and pork riblets. This is in itself a good bowl of noodles. The noodles also come with a small bowl of their lovely prawn soup that's just to die for."
"A really unique tasting prawn noodle, better than it looks. I'd come again. Dry/soup with optional pork rib/tail/intestines/liver. Generous fried pork lard. Addictive broth. $8 for smallest regular size is higher than avg you pay in SG."
The prawn noodles are average base on the price point if you ask me... I feel that either the portion could be more or price should be lower. Taste is decent..
"Prawn Kway Teow Mee with Intestines. Found out about this prawn noodle stall just before circuit breaker and their broth is superb, the former Joo Chiat prawn mee may have moved to Ayer Rajah food centre, but we have a contender Joo Chiat prawn noodles."
"Enjoyed the bowl of prawn noodle at Da Dong. Contrary to review of little soup, I was served with a nearly full bowl of soup which is enough to satisfy my palate. Stall run by a team of young people and I will give a thumbs up for the quality and service given."
"Came here because it seems very popular with some of my friends, but after giving it three chances, I guess the broth is really not the kind I like. It's more like a thick chicken ramen broth with some hints of prawn flavour... whereas I'd prefer a more intense prawn flavour without this sticky richness. That said the noodles are done well, the pork ribs are tender, the beansprouts are properly blanched (i.e. without that vegetal character that raw sprouts tend to have), and the intestines are plump and clean-tasting. Expect to wait at least 30min for your food (45min for me at 11.30am) if you're here at lunchtime though."
Ordered the dry version.  Soup a bit of herbal taste.  Not the best prawn noodle that I have eaten but probably in the top 7
fantastic. especially on a rainy day
"$8 for a regular size bowl of prawn noodles.

Portion give for $8 is small. Soup given is very little.  4 slices of half prawns.
The soup is good I must say.
Will not try again as price doesn't justify the quantity."
The stock for the soup is awesome.  Weekends sells out fast
very nice broth. prawns are bigger than usual.
"Small stall at the coffee shop and the can be very popular and crowded during lunch time. They actually sold out by 1215pm and so do come earlier. The broth is excellent but they can only give you just enough. The prawn can choose with different in size and my advise just take the normal size as you won't miss the prawn quality with small ones. The ribs was tender and the lard added give you extra boost of taste. The price is rather expensive for $10 per bowl and I don't think worth that much. However, overall taste is ok and slightly above average. Operated by 2 youngsters and  hope encouraging to see their passion!"
Nice prawn noodle
"Have been having Da Dong since the 1970's, back then aunty and uncle sold about 30 bowls a day as some might think that they were expensive but how is it expensive at $10/ for the big bowl when the broth is the best ever with goodness in prawn head (loads) and pork bone being boiled for more than 24 hrs..then the spare ribs/intestines/liver/pig tail is of good quality and never forgetting the peeled prawns that goes with this ""BEST PRAWN NOODLES BY CHEFDAN"". Most important fact now is the 2nd generation that has taken over!! Salutations to the children for their beliefs in their parents. This is legacy standards! Thankyou and am very proud of you guys! For the late "" foodblog"" writers of which most of you have been, try harder and please walk the streets to discover and not being paid for ""BEST"" food is a virtue as you will only be writing the truth."
Super pricey bowl of prawn noodle. Yayah attitude while ordering. Not much people yet say wait time is 45 minutes long. Guess they are just slow. Worse still- tables are all not cleared but left there to feed pigeons. Not recommended. Rather consume beach road prawn noodles instead.
I'm biased as I live near by - DaDong has great fresh live prawns and braised pork ribs with a broth so good you can't get a refill  recommended
Nice.. but must wait for seats and servings.
8 dollar Soup version. Soup is not bad but rather stingy eh.
Overpriced ... $8 for a bowl of prawn noodles with 3 thin slices of pork and small prawn which I think only worth $3.50. The menu said pork rib but what I got was only 3 thin slides of pork. Taste is so so too. Wouldn't visit this store again. Nearby there is another prawn noodles selling bigger prawn noodles with lower price...
"Love the freshness of the prawns, great flavor of the beehoon soaking up the soup. Go early if you want to avoid the crowd. Love the clean flavor of the soup. Thumbs up!"
"Guys. This is way better than Da Tong prawn mee at Joo Chiat with regards to value, taste and portion. I am comparing with Da Tong prawn mee because they both serve the same kind of brownish unami prawn stock coupled with yellow noodle, mee hoon or kway tiao.  I ordered a $7 portion with 8 half slices of prawn in a big bowl of prawn stock and a decent portion of noodle. However a $8 bowl at Da Tong is only half of what i am getting here and Da Tong soup is so precious that their bowl is only half filled with their prawn stock. I felt being ripped off after seeing Da Tong miserly portion of $8 and after eating this fulfilling bowl of prawn noodle at Loyang Way."
"less msg than beach rd prawn mee, tastes home cooked. very good"
Delicious prawn noodle with rich and flavourful broth. Noodles are very well done with just the right amount of q and softness. Chili paste for the dry version is not too spicy and goes very well with the prawns and noodles. Very nice balance and harmony in the dish. Just hope that they can be more generous with the soup.
"OMG.... this is one of the most overpriced prawn noodles I have eaten.

$8 for a bowl of prawn noodles+bee hoon with 2 prawns (sliced into 4 halves) and a few slices of pork! The soup, while tasty, has a slight herbal taste.

At this price I would rather eat at the other one down the road or even the one at beach road.

By the way, I ordered with pork rib and they gave me this."
Settled prawn mee crave finally! Still one of the best in SG! #DontSayBojio
Hands down the best prawn noodles in Singapore. Broth is amazing!
"rich, powerful, flavourful broth,
fresh, bouncy, chewy prawn,
soft tender pork ribs, ah gong ah ma no teeth also can eat :)"
"The soup can be really nice but honestly the stinginess with the soup spoils everything. We da paoed, and the soup provided could hardly fill half the height of the noodles. It doesn't help when it's a $8 bowl with 2 small prawns"
"Cravings hit and we took away 5 packets during the lockdown and was very shocked at how little soup we received when we portioned it out. It's tasty for sure, but a very unpleasant experience when your basically eating boiled noodles with hints of prawn stock. Especially at this price point, I think we've stopped being fans."
Second generation eating establishment run by the owner's son and his two sec school friends. They give good vibes and happy to see fellow young Singaporeans keeping up our Singapore food heritage alive. Good job guys!
"Best ribs noodles I've ever had, e v e r"
"One of the best prawn noodle soup I had in Singapore. The stall is located in a old style coffee shop that would involve nostalgic feeling when you step in. The soup is thick, clear and tasty. Not too salty or sweet, strong prawn taste. The prawns tasted fresh, meat is firm. The pig liver was cooked nicely. Not overly cooked till hard like other stalls. However I feel the oil is not strong enough to enhance the taste of pig liver."
Overrated and overpriced. Only the soup is good but not worth the money. Less traveled customers would think that this is the only good prawn noodle around.
"My friend told me the soup is very good. Better than some other famous stall. I was sceptical. So i went over to try.

While queuing to order, i saw a little boy finishing the soup till the last drop. Ok interesting, i thought. And despite the long Q, the staff is nice and friendly.

To my actual tasting.

1st mouth, it's ok. Sweetness of prawn not too salty.

1/2 way, I was truly impressed. The soup is very tasty. A fine balance between the sweetness of the prawn and the flavourful pork ribs.

Finished the whole bowl till the last drop."
"My weekend must go breakfast when I was staying at Katong, never ceased to get bored. The soup is 'magical' how it keeps getting me back. The ingredients fresh and just the right amount, the proprietor kind, gentle and a total pro. I had experience this cuisine prepared by 1st Gen to 2nd Gen. It still got me going back."
One of my favourite prawn noodle   the soup is great
"Hidden along joo chiat. Another hidden gem. Closed on Tuesdays. Recipe passed down through skills and sweat. Broth is prepared daily early in the morning. Very tasty, very shiok very good. Will definitely be back for more."
Tasty prawn noodle. Not bad
Best prawn noodles for many years!
The dry prawn noodles was super yum and it came with a super tasty bowl of broth! Will be back!
One of the best ones around. Tasty soup indeed but probably from the pork ribs! Would be better if soup taste more prawny hence more crustacean flavour!
Amazing broth! One of the best in the island.
Better than usual prawn noodles u get at coffee shops.
"Hidden gem along Joo Chiat Rd! Not only is their food great, it was a rainy day when I visited the place and they insisted to shelter me to board my cab. They really make you feel like family."
Best prawn noodle in singapore in my opinion. The soup is thick and full of the prawn flavour. It's definitely more expensive compared to other stalls but it's all worth it. The liver is also tender and yummy.
"Price on high side, small portion as a kids size, must pay for the add on soup haha....
Taste just ok"
Good rich prawns noodles. Touch on the pricey stuff well worth the trek
"You know the Japanese la you. Spicy oil. You add that one. Whoa. Then become power! You provide that oil, then 5 stars."
Awesome soup
The soup is tasty
Soup is good and prawns are fresh. Highly recommended! Do go early before lunch time to avoid the crowd!
"Soup base is delightful, rich yet not overpowering. Ingredients are fresh and serving is just nice! Will visit again."
"Nice soup, prawns and pork rib. Value for money."
"One of the best prawn noodle i have tried! Slightly costly, but definitely worth it."
Favourite prawn noodle joint in Singapore!
"Tasty broth, don't feel thirsty after the meal, good service n humble young men, hope their customers don't keep asking for the refill of soup, be more understanding, he has  stated at the counter, it's because the day of their income  depends on the soup of the day."
Best prawn noodles in the east!
"Taste no doubt is nice. Unique soup, not thick but flavourful. Appearance and taste is sure worth to eat but a bit pricey relative to the one in Dunman Food market. Worth a try still."
Really legit prawn noodles
Decent bowl of prawn mee! Always impressed by their pork liver.
One of the best prawn noodles in singapore! A must try if you love prawn noodles
The stock here is really solid! As usual this is the only food stall in the small coffee shop. Today they even have young boys cooking instead of the old couple though I can still see the old woman cooking lunch for the boys. Maybe her kids??
Truly the best prawn noodles in Singapore!
One of the pricier prawn noodles in Singapore. Quality may vary from day to day.
Too pricey & not worth at all! Menu mentioned that it's pork ribs but thin slices of pork meat was served. Will definitely not be going back to this shop anymore!
"Mediocre, disappointing meal with a $8 price tag as minimum. The standard of any ordinary $3 prawn noodle in hawker centres, so as its ingredients. Soup was rich but at a ridiculous small bowl."
"Ordered big prawn noodles for $13. soup not aromatic and really tasteless... prawn also not fresh , no taste as well. Shallots too oily too. For the price point I would rather go to beach rd prawn noodles."
Super yummy. No smelly prawn smell at all. Costly but really worth it.
Small portion and long waiting time. Does not justify its high price
"Yummy, with a unique taste that isn't quite like the usual prawn soup broth. Big prawns are large and juicy, be ready to shell out & $13-$20 for a bowl of those. Pick the dry option!"
"tried this corner kopitiam for the prawn noodles; soup tasty and ingredients well distributed, but at $8 per bowl, it's a bit pricey for me, so just a one-time visit
"
"The beautiful flavours of prawn noodles comes within the combination of prawns, pork and inlets to bring individuals flavours to a bowl of rich and warm noodles to you.

This is new generation hawker that has since taken over from their parents while retaining the old artisan of work to balance the flavours. Within East Coast, this would probably be a lesser known, less commercial prawn eatery but I was blown away by the stock flavours. I added pork ribs and pig inlets and both were flavoured on its own meaning the stall owners would have painstakingly marinated and cleansed the parts well.

The right amount of chilli, was added together with oil to being more texture to the noodles. If there is something to review about, it's the texture of the noodles which can be perfect. You can still get away with this by adding in the flavourful prawn stock soup. A true gem within the sleepy Joo Chiat."
The flavours are very rich. Ingredients are of premium quality and fresh. Slightly higher price point but definitely worth it! The cook takes his time to ensure the quality of every bowl of noodles. Must try!
Old school type of prawn noodles..overpriced and average tasting..
Best Prawn Noodles I have ever taken
Best prawn mee in town!
Over rated prawn noodles. $8.00 and with small bowl of soup for dry set. Worse is they put tomato ketchup in the noodles. I believe the noodle can't make out the prawn noodle taste. Thumb-down
"It's a total rip of for a bowl of $8 prawn noodle in Singapore with three mini shrimps and two think slick of pork . Taste is mediocre and forgettable , you can taste better one in blanco court or the nearby prawn noodle place in Still road where $8 can give you jumbo prawn .

Totally not worth to come here . Save yourself the money and time."
"Very bad experience, rude staff. Left a very bad taste. We hardly leave 1-star review but this stall is deserving of it."
Doesn't seems to be the same as old. Soup base is bland... Not worth the $$ and will not return.
We were disappointed. No taste to the food. We spent $80 SGD and felt like it was wasted. Sorry but that's the way we felt.
Best place for prawn noodles!
Prawn Noodle is very good. Soup is thick and tasty. Owners are friendly young chaps and there is even a carpark right in front of the coffee shop.
"Prawn noodle is tasty but personally don't think it worths the Queuing time. (30+ mins for my case even though is seated)
Their operation process does not look organized."
"Generally good taste but broth does not have too strong prawn taste, good broth nevertheless. Prawns were pretty fresh, ribs is a good blend of meat and fat. Not sure why but the prawn mee (regular size) did not keep us full for long."
"Really worth the visit. Looks normal but tastes amazing. Lots of parking across too. Just beware that the pricing board goes Regular - Large - Small.. makes you assume the small portion is $8, which in actual fact is $5, and that's what I got. 2 half prawns and 1 rib. Makes for a good breakfast."
$8 for a bowl of prawn noodles with 1 and a half small prawn with two ribs is very very pricey.
Parking no issue
A bit pricey. Taste ok. Still not what I expected
Unique broth  can't taste this in other prawn noodle shop
Worth every cents. Awesome soup with simple noodle and garnishes. Worth the q.
Really good bowl of prawn mee. Love the broth not too rich and overpowering but still extremely flavourful.
"The broth is really tasty and prawns are fresh. It is relatively pricy compared to other similar prawn noodles stalls. Service are pretty slow so be prepared to wait near lunch hours. Read some reviews that they provided regulars and friends priority queue, and was surprised to find that to be true during my visit. There were at least two ""regulars"" cut the queue and got served almost immediately.

Likes: rich and flavourful broth, nice chilli for dry noodles, fresh prawns
Dislikes: pricy, queue system is messy, prawn not cleaned throughly"
"I give 1 star due to service standards. Regulars are priortised. If you are not a regular, u wait long altoh u r first in the queue. This is not the way to retain yr customers, u r pissing them off. Treat yr customers equally. Btw this is not the only best Prawn Noodles in SG."
"I eat everyday, literally, nuff said."
"Yum prawn noodles ! Seems like young entrepreneurs taking on the old tradition .. Pleasant service ! Good location .. giant carpark across the road .. Good for delicious quiet breakfast without paying an arm n a leg for kopi ..
Will return .."
The soup is very nice... But over price..$8 small bowl only
Nice prawn noodle with a very strong pork broth.
Delicious prawn soup. Portion is small.
Ok but price on the high side as compare to Beach Rd prawn mee.
Quote good but too pricey
Ordering services is very slow. And when it's our turn to order they served another table who are their friends and totally ignored us. We decided to stay in the queue bcus it's already our turn. But will not come again anymore. There are better prawns noodles in the East side with better services and much cheaper.
Pretty good prawn noodles.
Overly price for just a normal bowl of prawn noodles... not worth visiting there are better ones and of more value to money...
"Honestly it is one of the better stalls I've tried but definitely does not justify the price. One thing that irks me though is that they prioritise the regulars over other people. Just today I've witness how they execute 2 different service standards.

1. 6 people in the queue, customer number 6 is a regular but received noodles ahead of the other five customers. Thus making other people wait for a really long time for their noodles all because the owners will slot in the regulars order before other people.

2. At about 12.15pm, they turned away a couple saying that they are finished for the day. Couple went to order ban mian instead. Few minutes later, an elderly couple came by and started to place an order for 2 bowls of prawn noodle. Orders accepted by the owners but couple from before noticed it. Pretty sure the couple from before are quite pissed.

3. Orders are taking too long because there isn't a proper system in place. Broth is already done, the only ingredients that requires heating up are the noodles, pork ribs and prawn. They should rethink their work process again.

Will I come again, not really."
"Pricey, small portion, and we waited 1h to get our food. Other people who came after us got their food first??"
"Broth of a good prawn noodle is the main ingredient for a good bowl of prawn noodles. And the broth has just the right amount of sweetness and thickness for me. The soup base is a lot thicker than most places with just the right amount of sweetness. Aroma of the prawn can afford to be stronger but its hard to find that these days. Generous on the pork but the amount of prawn is only one piece cut into 1/2 but it's not the measly small shrimp type though
Try the pork liver. Nicely fried and to the right tenderness.
Overall a little pricey ($5 for a small bowl but filling enough)  but the taste is authentic enough for me to be back.
Be sure to head down early before 12pm to get your bowl especially on weekends."
Tasty but pricey so doesn't make sense for me from a value standpoint
Tasty but the drinks were hard to drink and the food was very spicy
"The broth is flavourful and has good prawn body to it. The prawns are really fresh and juicy. However the noodle was bland and the pork strips were dry. Service is quite slow even though we were there at early 730am and there wasn't anyone else in the queue.

Although the guy cooking seems somewhat friendly, the one taking orders weirdly doesn't acknowledge customers even when you are standing infront of the stall.

Overall At $8 for small bowl, the price point is too high and not worth it."
"The soup is thick and tasty, and ingredients were fresh. I came to revive the memory of the original stall at the old macpherson hawker center, which was operated by the father. Still as good,  my only gripe is the cost, at $8 for a regular bowl."
"Wei Dao Hao,Fen Liang Shao,Jie Qian Gui,Hao Chi"
"Don't have to come to this place unless u r a regular here, we didn't know about this unbelievably ridiculous rules, came here to try from the friend's recommendation, in the queue for 40mins, place order & sit down wait for another 40mins yet the food has not served due to they priority to serve the old customers to skip queue. No matter how good the noodle taste, such policy will keep us away."
"Portion is pretty tiny as compared to the price you're paying, so there really isn't much value for money. Other than that the broth is rich and more on the sweeter side."
Best in Singapore
Shiok but ex
"I've been around trying to find 'my kinda' prawn noodles. I found them via Burpple, gave it a try and I'm hooked now. Though prawn noodles + pig tail @ $10 may seem a little pricey. But it's definitely worth it. There's some kinda herb or mushroom they added in their stock, which keeps me coming back.
P. S, if anyone out there manages to figure out the secret behind the stock, please do tell"
Nice broth
Prices above average but soup base is good
"The soup is gao and tasty, prawn is sweet and fresh. I had the small bowl ($5), dry. Chilli not fantastic, noodles a bit too soft. Next time will order the soup.

Four stars because for $5, the portion is tiny, and the soup, which is the only plus point for this prawn mee, is pathetic in portion size. If you look at the picture, you can see how small it is. Compare it to the saucer of soya sauce and chilli. It's $1 for a soup refill, which I am fine with, but each time, it'll just be that miserable amount. It's nice, but doesn't leave you satisfied, especially after the half-hour wait."
Good kicking prawn noodles with good broth
Tried the soup version of a prawn bee Hoon noodles. The soup is very nice.
Best prawn noodle in Singapore
Standard is ok. Not the best but not the worst either. Freindly service. No queue
"UPDATE : Thought I try their prawn noodles again today. Minimum price was $8 for ""regular"" which I ordered. Such a rip off! Tiny tiny portion! Way overpriced. Never again!"
"Not value for money and average taste.  Dry comes with hardly any sauce and taste, and a tiny bowl of soup.  The only prawn noodle shop I have come across that says no refill of soup   at this price pouint of $8 for regular and $10 for large no soup refill??  And also the signboard is tricky (deliberately in my opinion) to put the $5 small bowl at the end so tis M, L, S in this order.  Not coming again as I think its not a honest to goodness business."
Light but savoury soup with distinct prawn character that one can have all day and not be wore down
Great taste of soup though price is high
"Usually I don't review poor places. $5 for small bowl . 1 prawn in broth. Yes, 1  only. Sliced halved. Mediocre broth, too porky. Place don't look as clean too. Good reason why Beach Road prawn  noodles got crowd yet none here."
Not cheap ...but really good ..
I've been a faithful follower of these noodles for the past 22 years. The pork and prawn broth is mixed perfectly. Also try the pork liver - it is sliced thinly and not overcooked so it is soft and melts on your tongue.
"This is the best prawn noodles in the entire island. Prawn noodles is my favourite dish, and while other stalls like Pek Gio prawn noodles are also on my list of favourites, I always return here. This is because the soup is always thick with a mixture of both pork, prawn and garlic flavours. This makes it less monotonous than other prawn noodles soup, which always taste only of prawn. The flavor is so strong it stays on your mouth after, and they do not have a drop of MSG in it. Instead it is the pure flavor of garlic and prawn that is sometimes left on your tongue. If you have a good relationship with the family that runs the stall, they tend to be more generous with the soup."
"<o+ TasteMarked Reviews +o>

This stall was highly recommended by one of our clients. We came here during lunchtime, plenty of seats available, not crowded.
What I like:
- big bowl, big portion
- very thick soup
- just beside public parking area
What can be improved:
- soup a bit too salty
- pricy for a simple stall like this ($8-$15 per noodle)
- a bit boring till the end - the portion could be lesser
We have also tried pork trotters and ginger chicken clay pots next stall - surprisingly good."
My favourite prawn noodle 
"Jie Ge Gao Liao Dian,Ke Shi Zhen Cai Shi Liao!!!Hao Chi"
"Went to give it a try today, honestly, nothing to rave about. Pretty mediocre. Ordered prawn and pork ribs noodle, pork intestines and pork tail. Taste was so -so, not flavourful enough, too salty and soup was very little. The soup was also lukewarm. The dry version, chilli was not great. $8 a bowl! The guy was very polite and friendly."
Delicious and laid back street side prawn noodles.  Fast service and friendly staff :)
"Horrible queue, been waiting for 1.5 hours"
Ordered meepok and I prefer my noodles more Q. Prawn soup was not too shabby and the prawns were all peeled nicely . The pork ribs were small in pieces and the pig tail was chewy and quite nice. Liver was just liver I guess.
"Regular weekend breakfasts for the past few years since moving into neighborhood. Opened since 1964, original owner is in frail health, passing down to son. Inherited the essence of prawn-based soup."
I've been eating their prawn noodle for more than 40 years. It's still the best!
Nice big prawn noodle however stock could be more rich
"Very slow seevice.  Took a good 10mind to cook a bowl of noodles when I was the only customer in the queue.

$8 for regular bowl of prawn mee came with a tiny serving.  Taste is ok only.  Nothing special.

First and last time eating."
"It's ok. Prawns were properly prepared, not overcooked unlike most places."
Nice thick soup base and great texture of the noodles.
"Da Dong is one of the better places for prawn noodles. Less pricy compared to Wah Kee or Jalan Sultan but still provide enough Ooommmph! It is good enough for me to be back, in fact I have been back here for my prawn noodles fix more than 5 times"
Mediocre taste and expensive
"Price does not justify the mediocre bowl of prawn mee. Unless it's within an arm's length and I'm dying of hunger and have alotta moolah to spare, I won't wna makan here ever. Just snooping around the island for prawn mee."
Best Big Prawn noodles in town
I liked the crispy shallots oil and pork lard cubes they added into the soup. The pork ribs were good too.
Has the best soup
Nice soup base and Super tender pork ribs!!
Tasty prawn noodle
Great soup base and nice mee
"We've got a great hawker scene here in Singapore and prawn noodles is one of Singapore's beloved hawker food.

Having tried many prawn noodles from various places, I find it's really quite hard to beat the ones served here at Da Dong.

Rich, flavourful power-packed prawny flavoured broth
Al dante prawns with succulent fall-off-the-bones pork ribs
Over perfectly seasoned noodles with chilli (we normally choose kway teow, a local flat broad white noodle which the seasoning sauce adheres to well)

We prefer ours dry so we can enjoy the best of both worlds: the wonderful prawn broth and the perfectly seasoned noodles with chilli.

We always find ourselves comparing other prawn noodle stores with Da Dong's.

It's a weekly fix for us (well most weeks)

Love it."
"Not so good, too much MSG felt really thirsty after the meal."
"The way they've been at it since 1966. Traditional, old school way."
My Fav Prawn Noodle in SG. The only downside is that you don't get to eat unless you get there early enough.
"Bad experience ! Is expensive and service is poor !!! Not worth the price !!! And best of all, they forgot my boyfriend's order !!! When we are sitting just in front of the stall !!!!"
"Love the soup. A bit ex though, but I would rather pay for this than go for the almost as ex Beach Rd Prawn Noodle"
Very delicious broth!! Prawns are always fresh & succulent.
Prawn noodles dry or wet...Super Lousy. Soup do not even taste like prawn soup. Lady stares at u when u say that soup was too little b4 we even tried. So?  Don't waste time and money here. The simple one at Dunman food court round the corner   anytime. 
The time that I went it was dark. Only can pat in cash. We ordered it and guess what the person gave such a small portion. I often visit this chain in places liek maxwell and tampines and they give much bigger portions. Wouldn't even give a star for this place.
"They dont honor their promotion. No promotion for the 30% of the cheaper bowl. Instead they applied the 30% discount from $8.30 bowl which i didnt order it. Isnt the promotion flyer indicating 30% discount for 2nd bowl (lowest priced bowl), confusing consumers. The cashier not doing anything and simply brush me off by saying it is computer generated receipt.

I ordered 1 chicken cutlet $7.30 and 1 luncheon meat $5.80, i should pay $11.36 instead of $13.10."
"I am a milk tea lover, particularly HK style. Always tried drink/coffee stalls for their milk tea when I stayed in Singapore.

De Ji milk tea was typical hawker market standard. No surprises. Taste of milk covered tea smell. No fragrance of tea.

The drink stall adjacent to De Ji was Tek Siong which could provide a very close HK style of milk tea. Both milk and tea were mixed in an optimal amount. The way the stall owner prepared milk tea was also close to Hong Kong style.

Coffee Queen was also at the same  food center. The quality of milk tea was maintained at a high standard.

At this food center, if you are a milk tea lover, Tek Siong is the first choice, Coffee Queen is the next.  For De Ji, you can forget it."
Best teh halia! Even the other races folks will come and buy from this Chinese stall.
"Best drink place in the hawker! Ice milo is thick, you know they aren't skimping out on the milo powder! Also the teh tarik is unparalleled! Best teh tarik in the east in my opinion! The Teh O and Teh C is also very good. My family always orders from them and we have been patrons since 2008. Quality never dropped.

I've also seen a lot of people order the sugarcane juice, which I heard is not bad, but I never tried it before.

The uncles are always very nice and cheerful. If there isn't a lot of people, sometimes they will offer to bring it to your table which is very sweet of them."
"There are many drink stalls here and the one that I went even had another drink stall right beside it. So the uncle at this stall was quite nice. I ordered my drink and the uncle offered to send it over to my table. But maybe because I was nearby as well.

I ordered their teh bing which was not bad. Did not have a strong siap-ness and was mildly sweet. I would advise you to drink it fast as once the ice melts the drink becomes quite bland. Did not take a picture of my drink as I was too busy eating. But the drink came in a takeway cup with a cover in case you wanna know."
Tasty! And I like that - despite being deep fried - items are not overly soaked in fat.
Best You Tiao and Butterfly buns!
"It is a great choice for cheap dim sum.
Price at $1.50/each. Buy 10 get 1 free.
Where else you can get this price around Woodlands, Sembawang area?
Fret not, it is 24 hours stall.. you can sink your teeth with this at wee hours.
I personally love this."
Can we still trust those 5 Star grading? We r looking at the reviews to visit. I'm too kind but not this time anymore. Thanks you for Ur unforgettable service.
"U no need to talk loud! A new comer will never be better for this stall, order 2 sets 6 pcs become 6 sets, ask nicely change face. U will never get a 5 star service here or I can say not even 3 star as after order the food no longer have appetite. From my bad experience 1.30 to 1.50 now still the same service or i can say bad to worst. Thank u for the unforgettable service today!  "
"Last review was 4 years back, came here again and the food didnt disappoint. Price point was still alright too!"
Good food and spread. Very efficient
Many chio bu here
good food. convenient location
Food still as good as it gets. Where to find $1.50 dim sum with many varieties.
"If using public transport, it's quite an effort to get to this place! There is a lot of seating here. The assortment of these little treasures will please most non-halaal people. The waiting time is short and the flavourful offerings are tasty and great. There is a wonderful array of sauces to compliment the dim sum. It's a great outing to explore this well-hidden gem. On the most recent visit, in January2025, however, the quality and service could certainly be improved. Now in May 2025, being a quiet weekday, it was superb, tasty and the service and cleanliness here was great! I love the chives and the spinach dim sum best!"
cheap dim sum ...not nice...
Need to do more cleaning on the table always looks dirty everytime when I was there
Food is cheap and nice!
"Every dim sum dish is priced at $1.50, which attracted a long queue. However, the queue moved quickly. While the dim sum quality is far from the best, it exceeded expectations considering the price point. The eating house where this stall is located is large, spacious, and pleasantly cool on a Sunday morning."
"There was an aunty at a counter who kept taking other people's orders, but would not take mine. I waited for around 13-15 minutes before she finally accepted the money which I wanted to pay with. The customer service by this aunty is horrible. Food isn't too bad, service could definitely improve."
Cheap Dim Sum available. Although it's jn a coffee shop. Don't expect any services to be provided.
"Came here a few times already. Buy 10 free 1 dimsum. Each selling for 1.50. quite cheap imo. But food quality dont expect the best. It is good enough cheap food dimsum. Lady was very fast in serving.

Place is in dirty kopitiam with rubbish n cockroach running around (probably bcos I came here during late hours for supper)

Recommend the sesame seed balls with peanut fillings inside. It's not bad!"
"Dim Sum Express (Kuai Can Dian Xin) never disappoints! Their dim sum is not only delicious but also super affordable, making it my go-to spot whenever I'm craving a satisfying feast without breaking the bank. The flavors are authentic, the portions are generous, and everything is served fresh and piping hot. Always coming back for more! "
24hrs Dim Sum in Woodlands Area. The price is pocket friendly.
"The porridge tastes good.  The siew mai is not as nice as I remember.

No longer has a long queue since they increased the price from $1.30 to $1.50."
"I recently had the pleasure of visiting this restaurant, and it did not disappoint. The varieties are overwhelming and very affordable. 1.50 per item and one free item for every 10 otems

Overall, it's a highly recommended spot for anyone looking to enjoy a simple yet flavorful meal. I'll definitely be returning!"
Standard and taste of dimsum has drop. Previously they when they started selling at $1.30 per item. The dimsum standard is good and tasty. After they increased the price to $1.50 buy 10 free 1 the dimsum standard drop. Sometimes the dimsum did not steam thoroughly with the taste of refrigerator. When business is famous and grow standards always drop. Abit disappointed but for the price of eating dimsum still considering cheap but pls at least steam the dimsum thoroughly hot. Because it will affect the taste and might cause diarrhea for those weak stomach customers.
Couldn't have asked more for 1.50 per item. Decent food at an affordable price.
Not the best but decent dim sum that open late thru the night. Cheap price at only $1.50..

"Dim Sum Express (Kuai Can Dian Xin): A Late-Night Dim Sum Haven with Budget-Friendly Bites

Alright, folks, listen up! My friends and I were craving a late-night dim sum fix after an our bike ride, and we stumbled upon Dim Sum Express (Kuai Can Dian Xin). This place was tucked away in a quiet corner, a little off the beaten path, but it was open 24 hours, which was perfect for our late-night cravings.

The Good:

* The Price: The dim sum was incredibly affordable. They had a deal where you could get a free basket of dim sum for every 10 baskets you bought, making it incredibly budget-friendly.  That was a huge plus, especially when compared to other dim sum places where a similar amount could easily cost you double or even triple the price.

* The Convenience: It was the perfect spot for a quick and easy meal, especially if you're looking for something budget-friendly. It was open 24 hours, which was a major plus for us!  It was the perfect place to satisfy a late-night craving. Plus, there was a large car park nearby, making parking a breeze.

The Quirks:

* The Food: The dim sum menu had a lot of variety, but honestly, the taste was just average. The har gow and siu mai, classic dim sum dishes, didn't really wow us.

* The Coffee Shop: The drink stall next to the dim sum stall only accepted cash, so keep that in mind.

My Friend's Note: I love that it's open 24 hours! It's great to have a place I can go to for dim sum whenever I want!

My Note: The price is great, but I think the food could be better.

Rating:

* Food: 3/5 (Just okay, not the best dim sum)

* Service: 3.5/5 (Acceptable)

* Atmosphere: 3.5/5 (Okay ambience)

Overall: 3/5

Overall: The ambience was decent, and the service was fine, but it was the affordability and the 24-hour availability that really stood out. It's a good option for a quick and easy meal, especially if you're looking for something budget-friendly.  I'd say if you're in the area, it's worth popping in to give it a try, but if you're a serious dim sum connoisseur, you might want to check out other options.  But for the price, it's a decent choice."
"Dim sum is average, not all items are nice. Siew mai and the fried roll is not bad, however the carrot cake, glutinous rice slightly below average. The carrot cake is not crispy and abit bland taste. Glutinous rice not as tasty as other dim sums in coffeeshop.
Overall a 3.5 star"
"My preferred $1.50 Dim Sum

~ Fun Fact: Used to be called Kuai San Dian Xin ($1.30 Dim Sum) yet due to inflation forced to changed name to Kuai Can Dian Xin after price increased to $1.50"
Good place for supper
"Affordable and wide range of steam and fried dim sum. Not the best around. The other stall at Mega coffeeshop slightly down the road has better quality.

Revisit during lunch: Loved the porridge

Revisit: tried the fried yam balls. Surprised to find char Siew inside. NICE! Carrot cake is ok too."
"The Dim Sum is affordable at $1.50 per container, buy 10 get 1 free. The taste is acceptable for the price."
"Inexpensive dim sum with lots of variety. However it's inexpensive for a reason, I didn't find quality great, eg congee was watery."
The price might be cheap but the food ain't worth it. Way worse quality than the hougang branch.
"The dim sum... Is rly very ordinary.
I think it is frozen food? But the price is damn good lor. U get for what u pay.

Good for families with growing children :)"
Cheap and nice dim sum.
Not a 4 star rating it deserve. Normal neighborhood DS.
Average Dim Sum with reasonable price
The food is worst to worst maybe the name of this shop is up ! So the taste run way.
Dim Sum is tasty and value for money. But avoid buying the ready made iced coffee from the drink stall next to Dim Sum stall. Disgusting beverage cos iced coffee has strong calamansi taste in it but stall assistant denied it and said iced coffee were made ready by other staff who stored in the fridge in the previous night so she was not responsible for it. Not even offering a refund or exchange another drink. I left the weird taste coffee at the counter and walked away. Really a hopeless customer service.
"Pro: Dimsum tastes comparable with restaurant.
Cons: Coffee shop too hot& only accept cash not even accept paylah nor paynow.
Anyway I will still visit again when craving for dimsum as it is a place worth the value to enjoy dimsum without worry about ."
"First time trying, surprised by the wide range of varieties! Generally the steamed stuff are nice, the siew mai is good! Chee cheong fun, bao etc.. the fried stuff are cold hence nt crispy.. overall great value if u hv dimsum crave"
Value for money. Not necessarily the best dim sum. The XO like chilli is good. Overall fairly good
"Came here on a Saturday for lunch and there was a steady queue that comes and goes. For any order of 10 dishes youll get 1 free.

Everything here is $1.50 so we spent $15 that feeds about 2~3 pax. Food here is average at best. Very much like the standard of those 'dim sum' shops in kopitiam that sells coffee.

But I have to say that their lor mai kai and chilli paste at the side was really good. For $1.50 there is nothing to complain really in this economy. And there is a huge variety to choose from too."
"Value for money, and serve quickly. But hot in the coffee shop, but no strong oily smell.
Food quality is not fantastic but reasonable for the price paid."
"the staff located at Woodland, very very very very poor and rude attitude to customer, scold customer."
good value for money
"All dim sum plate SGD1.50. Palatable. Considering the price. Dim sum is Yi Fen Qian,Yi Fen Huo. This price is worth 5-star quality considering elsewhere at SGD6.50 a plate.

Almost no damage to your wallet. LOL!"
"This is one of the best dim sum I have ever tasted.With low prices and above standard food,this place is recommended for people who like dim sum

I tried the Siew Mai,it's taste was just exceptional and the Seaweed Chicken which isn't too hard either and the Wu Xiang it's chicken is very delicious

My order was also very quickly prepared, making this extremely efficient too.

Definitely recommended"
"Good and affordable, buy 10items get 1 free. Not so crowded on Sundays."
"The best Dim sum its a must try.
Worth the money .
Ate still can't move."
"Food portion was ok for $1.50. Dim sum was not fantastic, porridge was okay"
"1 to 2 years ago, I wrote a 1 star review on this shop cus of very bad attitude from staff. But went back 2 times this week and was surprised by the 360 change of attitude of the staffs. Super friendly and helpful. Their dimsum has all along been very worth it for the price. Hope the staff's attitude and service remains this way."
"Above standard Dimsum, their standards are way above the overly rated ""R C."" A must try is their special chilies. The pork ribs are out of the world. Good 24-hour joint. Google Map is a bit nutter. Do drive in from the maind Road. Lookout for PRIMz building."
Like to have the dim sum or pack along the way home as it opens 24 hours. Last night packed frozen few sets Inclusive of 6 sets of xiang xi dumpling but this morning discovered only have 12 pieces in it instead of 18 pieces ( used to be).  Wondering there is some changes in quantity?
"Just your usual dim sum place in a hawker centre, perks to this place is that it opens till quite late. Do take note that this place only accepts cash. ;)"
"Price increase by 20-cents due to inflation. It is now $1.50, food standard ( portion and taste) drop."
Affordable dim sum. Service staff was fast and good. Every item is $1.50 
The big bao that I bought today has an unpleasant smell in the pork inside. Otherwise other stuff are fine
"Visited the stall on 1/2/24 evening. There is no Q. The PRC lady crew who served us not only is she unfriendly and rude, she still show very irritated bad behaviour when taking our order. This is not the first time we encountered such rude attitude from her. Please give her customer service training or transfer her out from this stall"
"Super cheap good dim sum in the north. Great value for money, good quality dishes. Be prepared to queue as many local know this place well."
"I like the dim sum there and worth to eat. But my last visit the workers look super tired and not friendly maybe due to working for long hour already.... so the food is not present properly.
overall worth to try if you never been there.
It is an industry area food court so don't expect too much."
porridge must try
"foods nice and cheapest in Singapore
At Woodlands close."
Good money worth for the food.
"Wo Men Da Gai 11++pmQu WoodlandsChi. Zhong Guo Dian Yuan Tai Du Fei Chang Chai,Yi Hou Bu Hui Zai Qu Liao. . . "
"The services was quick poor especially the China staff form there. We went there to eat before we came back home at midnight, the China staff was quick rude while she take our order half way then do her own things but for the boys, she smile at them and even talk to them while they order, her services to the boys was totally different from ours."
staff service was poor as the staff doesn't care and her attitude towards me and my family was poor.
After all these years though raised the price from $1.3 to $1.5. Taste and portion stays consistent. Recommended.
"Super cheap and good dim sum in Singapore.
Now price up to 1.5 per piece but still worth it.
Beside that 24 hr operation."
"Weekend breakfast place. For $1.50, the dim sum are worth it. My usual are siew mai, Nuo Mi Ji,Chun Juan just to name a few
Overall, good for the price.
Current promotion is buy 10 items and get 1 foc."
"Went there on a Saturday night. No queue, place was quiet and service is fast. The service staff doesn't seems to be giving any attitude.

Siew mai and lo mai kai is value for money."
Always good for a quick fix for dim sum ! Har Gao was fresh and good. My kid like the fried carrot cake.
"Check this out..24hours dining place to indulge in wide range of dim sum from steamed, fried and stewed range. It's my Love at first bite on the fried carrot cake. Char siew pau taste good too, with reasonable char siew filling. The stewed ""Phoenix claws"" was served hot right from their steamer. Spacious seating areas and probably the crowd was less during 3-4pm when I visited this express station. Stall owner was kind and there's a promotion ongoing in which customers will get 1 dim sum free when the order reach  10 items, buy 10 get 1 free, definitely a good deal to grab. However, considering I just had my lunch sometime back, I ordered only 5 types of dim sum, and it appears that I had a good start at 5, definitely will revisit and try out the rest of the dim sum. Overall reasonable pricing and good range of dim sum offerings for customers to explore, dining in groups of friends can definitely hit the promotion. Recommend to dim sum lovers who happen to heading up to the north. "
"Food is ok but service was really bad, the chinese staff was very rude and gave me a death stare for no reason"
"Generally the food was decent for the price. The fried prawn dumpling was disappointing. When I choose 10+1 dishes, the staff only packed 10 dishes (missing the second set of pork ribs )"
"The food n price is good. But the service at Prime Bizhub is really bad especially this particular Chinese lady who works night shift. Her attitude is really horrible and very rude. The company should do something about it. Am not going back there again even the food and price are good. She spoilt customer's mood. We are there to enjoy the food, but the way she serves customer, is not even zero.

"Drop in food quality. The Yu Jiao is hard, not crispy at all. The Fen Guo skin is also hard and thick. Porridge is so watery. Price increases but quality drops."
The dim sum is over rated here. Price has increased to $1.50 which is still consider reasonable but the quality is not there. Do not recommend eating there even the price is cheaper than other eatery.
Not bad.. Nice food.. 
Great food at an unbelievable pricing 
"Extremely affordable dim sum place at Woodlands. Everything is at $1.50, with a variety of delectable food choices ranging from century egg porridge to siew mai, and not to mention, it is 24hrs. Highly recommend checking this place out."
"Nice place with tasty types of food to choose between. But I'll go for the ah mah Rou Gu Cha,try the chicken herbal soups it's really nice and cheap in price.. I'll not tell you guys the prices, but try the chicken soup and rice 5 bucks are enough for that so not consider expensive for nowadays, such a great soup.. So I'll pass the review to those who visited and tried it okay you won't regret I think.. "
OK if you are looking for budget and a quick meal
$1.50 per basket. Very nice and cheap Tim sum
Good selection of Dim Sum.
they dropped a tray of frozen chee cheong fan on the floor next to the sink and just picked it back up and put them back in the tray 
Cheap simple dim sum
Typical food court. Nothing much special. The enclosed space make conversations difficult as the echoes can get pretty noisy
"It's value for money and taste decently fit for $1.30/type. I do think dining straight from there could be nicer, as steam and fried stuff after tapao soggy. But overall still worth the walk (because it is located in an industrial building with nearest bus stop is 500m away.
~Updated Apr 2023~
The price has increased to $1.50 per portion, which I think it's still reasonable with the recent inflation. It has been quite sometime I have not visited the place, but still decent taste and portion size still remain the same as last time. Shout out to some of the items I like, wrapped chicken, carrot cake, bean curd skin roll & fried bean curd sheet roll. I think it's value for money compared to those outside. The spread can easily buy 10 selection then get another 1 free. Can support."
Jie Ge He Li
They have many varieties and portions are normal. Great pricing.
Good Tim Sum @$1.30 per serving with different varieties. Porridges similar price .All served fresh due to food high turnover. Plenty of seats. 24hrs. Parking charges apply. No public accessible transport available in sight. Prices has increased after covid CB.
"1.50 per dish, you can fine wo much expectations!"
Enough variety. Priced at $1.50 each. Good quality. Best is 7x24. Will visit again.
"Now that I just found out it was $1.30 each just a year ago... Argh! Damn inflation! 

We liked the fried carrot cake,  yam ball and prawn dumpling best - it has this nostalgic taste to it ... Very old school I would say...

As with most reviews, the dim sum quality is average, for the amount that we paid, it was a satisfying affordable dinner. 

We paid $1.50 per plate and spent all of $21.00 for 15 types of dim sum. What is there to complain about?  The filling and taste were reasonable for us to consider coming back when we're in the area "
Basic dimsum ... taste so so... can get very crowded ... however service is fast. Current promotion 10 free 1... so great value for a dimsum meal with yr buddy.
Pricing not bad at times of Russian/Ukraine war & increased GST. Let us hope this pricing cum portion shall still remained the same forever! Keep it up!
24 hours dim sum with just $1.5 per item!!!
"Taste is ok  Value for money. Prices increased from $1.30 to $1.50, , Thus changed name from Kuai San Dian Xin toKuai Can Dian Xin. long queue during weekend mornings."
Just encountered a VERY rude employee. Will never return again.
"The price is worth it.

The quality matches the price"
"Cheap is the best description for this shop. Food is way below average. Some of the items look and taste pathetic, can't even tell its a dim sum."
"Chi Wu Can De Hao Qu Chu!Zui Xi Huan Chi Ta De S$1.30Dian Xin,Chao Bian Yi!"
"Only $1.30 per serving super cheap to eat your fill without spending too much! Long operating hours too, and tons of options. Quality not as good but cannot complain for the price. Do do do get more of the chilli, damn shiok!"
"Very worth it for the price! Of course, quality is not top notch. But it satisfies a dimsum craving. Service was prompt and staff was very friendly. Thought I would get the same experience because I ate at tampines greenforest outlet before - staff always black face there. But it was a pleasant surprise here at woodlands outlet."
Food is quite good for the price . But service stuff is incredibly rude . Threw the food on the counter and expected customer to ownself pick up for him. It's 12am... I'm the only customer . I don't know what he is so busy for ?
Cheap Dimsum where available 24hrs. Best choice when you are hungry middle of the night but can't think of any food to eat rather than McDonald's
Weekends expect to have a very long Q. All dim sum at $1.30 and many varieties to choose. Taste not so bad as dont expect m7ch with that kind of price.
Lousy service.
"The price are good , but food / dim sum are normal ."
Good for famil and friends gathering.
Nasi Padang store power. Morning spreads awesome and look out for Wednesday special only Chicken Briyani. Yummyyy. But lunch time usually packed.
Cheap and reasonably good. But please don't compare them with 5 star restaurants. It's too bad they do not sell the fried banana red bean paste roll anymore.
"More variety Dim sum there.
Friendly and helpful"
Nice old town
"24hrs - Cheapest dim sum you can find,
The food is edible, taste average and fulfilling
Hygiene level is Average
My first choice when I woke up from hunger for late midnight super or early breakfast"
"Wide selection of items offered,  and taste good."
I am amazed by this dim sum they sell. It is crispy on the outside n chewy inside
"Jing Ji,Hao Chi "
Affordable dimsum
Good food and good price
"1.30 is the limelight. Food is above average. Service is almost none, but it's 1.30 per dish, u can't expect much."
"Cheap & fresh dim sum, variety of choices"
Still didnt increase price after inflation. Nice.
Dim sum is value for money but be prepared to queue.
Dk bad luck or what eat until get food poisoning ate it this morning end up visiting toilet 4 time per hour. Had some prawn dumplings
Cheap and good. Every plate is at $1.30. Highly recommended porridge and carrot cake and chee cheong fun.
Hao Hao. Bu Guo Zai JURONG SIDE COPORETION 346ANa Ye You Yi Jian Fen Xing. 
$1.30 per plate of Dim Sum. Lots of variety (about 30types). Including HK style Chee Cheung Fan (char siew or prawn). Parking is open space.
One of the best kway chap this side of town.
Cheap dim sum at average quality.
Nice din sum at $1.30 per dish
"Food was cheap
Taste was just meh
Opened 24hours so might come for supper if lazy go sweechoon"
"Very satisfying dim sum, price is very worth and serving portion is quite ok. Recommended their chee cheong fun and century egg porridge. Besides that, most of the dim sum quite good and a lot of choices available. Worth for a visit."
Cheap and valuable for the price.
Reasonable taste but cheap!!!!!
Cheap n nice food. Everything only 1.30 .
"The dishes are all $1.30 per portion.

Tasted the Siew Mai, Har Kow, toufu roll. Not too shabby."
"I always come here for midnight supper. Food is still $1.3, what more do you want to ask for? Drinks on the other hand...... Lol better to just drink tap water or canned drink."
Affordable dimsum around Woodlands with each item costing only $1.30!
Damn worth it. Standard quite high 
"Great food at an affordable pricing. Wider selection of items compared to other outlets of the same chain. Ample seating available too, considering its situated in an industrial area coffeeshop."
Value for money.
"We were there at 4.30am, the staff was attentive, and proactively reminded us that there are chilli and sauces we can take. The chee cheong fun was sour at one end, suspect not very fresh?... Other items we ordered were Ok, and taste good. Recommend yam dumpling, chicken feet, ribs and wrapped chicken."
The price is the best part. Food wise still acceptable.
"Food is average, but service is really bad. Went there on 31 March 2022, at around 2.20am, there was one lady preparing the food for tomorrow. Once she saw us coming, she gave us a stare and a really bad attitude, also she is throwing all the stuff around and kind of venting it out. We are standing in front of the counter for around 5 minutes and she is not showing any signs that she will be serving us any time soon so we asked if she is selling dimsum or not and she just gave us a stare and slowly make her way to us, still showing us a black face. When ordering, we ordered crisp roll (some beancurd skin rolls) but there were two similar ones (we had experience of ordering the seafood one but they gave us the pork one so this time we wanted to make sure) so we asked which one is made with pork or seafood and she kept asking us for the number on the menu and she start being irritated with us. And later on we got angry as well as she started shouting at us and she say ""go, go and report to my boss ah"", ""go and find my boss now"". And obviously she knows that her boss is nowhere near hence she said that. Afterwards she asked us to call the police and we were like this is a small matter to be alerting the police and we told her if she wants she can call the police herself. Afterwards police came and took statements from both sides and during this time she still gave us an attitude and still throwing stuff around as if we are the ones who is in fault. She even told the police that we threaten her and her life is in danger haha. What a joke. Super bad experience from kuai san dim sum.

Edit : Also read multiple reviews here that says they have a bad experience eating here during midnight. Maybe the stall owner should take some time to read to reviews to be able to improve their services. We are not paying to get that kind of attitude. Hopefully there will be an improve, or else consumers can just choose the bakchomee opposite their stall, pretty sure their staff have more respect and service attitude than this stall's."
"Reasonable price ,food not so good"
Good dim sum value for the price. Taste is bit of hit or miss. Steamed yam cake is not bad.
"Price is 1.3 per dish, taste is acceptable. Hard to find better deal than this"
Good place for food...
"Decent dim sum and of coz cannot compare it to a restaurant standard. If you are craving a decent dim sum and not willing to spend $$, this is a place to go. I would say their red bean bun is not too sweet, Shao Mai (shao mai) is tasty and not overly steam."
Nice for gathering
"2 thumbs up! fast service and tasty, affordable dim sum, definitely recommend everyone to try this stall!"
Average with reasonable price... But the Thai food here is good!
"Price is cheap , but the food is so so"
"Queue a bit longer than usual, but still ok. At $1.30 for any dish, its still worth a bit of wait."
"Other than affordability, nothing else. Surprisingly the Chinese store opposite does sell reasonably good Knife Sliced Noodles."
"6th Feb 2021, 12.15am
Poor staff attitude.
My boyfriend and I went for supper.
We ordered a few dishes.
When we received our century egg porridge, my boyfriend asked if he could have more century egg, the China counter staff replied, 'Can, you pay 2 dollars.'. This is a 1.30 dim sum shop, if he wanted more century egg, he has to pay 2 dollars? Does this even make sense? I have been here multiple times and everytime, I encounter staffs with poor attitude.

There is also no way to contact the management to reflect the situation. Horrendous service."
My usual dim sum place. Everything is $1.30. Some items are pretty worth it (like 3 siew Mai and the big pau). Usually a queue if you go on a weekend.
"Worth it dimsum food for it's price but food taste wise is average only.

My personal favourite out of the items tried today is the century egg porridge.

Fills you up for a low price."
"Definitely one of the cheapest dim sum you can find in Singapore. Variety is decent with a few stand outs. Quality of the food is decent, though not the best dim sum you can find, but best at the price you can find. Definitely recommended, especially if you stay nearby."
Cheap and tasty they call it the Daiso of dimsum
24h Quick fix for dim sum crave
"No frills cheap dim sum. Some of the dim sum isn't really good, but for $1.30, you can't complain. Well worth it if you just want to scratch that dim sum food craving cheaply."
The Dim Sum pricing is very reasonable and the food is served hot and there are varieties of Dim Sum. Like to come here to get my Dim Sum fix.
Value for money. Varieties of Dim Sum available 24hrs.
"Cheap and good selections.

the shop seems to be related to KIMLY dimsum but cheaper..."
24 hour dim sum if you need to fill your stomach after midnight. Dim sum standard is average but price is cheap at $1.30 per item
Cheap and decent service
"Basic and acceptable dim sum when it comes to taste, but extremely value for money. $1.30 dim sum will definitely fill you up and breaks the mental barrier that dim sum is expensive.

Taste is generally average for the 5 items i ordered as shown in pics attached to review. But hey, when that volume of food amounts to $6.50.... how to complain right?

The adjacent drink stall also serves up pretty decent beverages."
"Portions wise, like the cha siew zhu chang fen  were small in size, century egg porridge small bowl and not hot enough. Fried spring roll, wasn't fried well and crispy. Jiu Cai Siew mai and normal siew mai were not bad. Fried yam dumpling was nice. Chicken glutinous rice nice also. Fried prawn dumpling wasn't crispy enough. Fried beancurd sheet roll taste normal, and the da ji bao not bad. Basically an average place for dim sum if you're staying around the vicinity and the price is the main draw. So can't say is recommended for nice dim sum. Was here on 5 Dec 2021."
Cheap and good
"Went there for supper. Most of the time the staffs doing the midnight shift are so rude to their customers. Not sure if they are under paid. I mean if they don't like their jobs should just find other things to do, have some passion and pride in your work, OMG! Soulless staffs."
Zhe Jian Ka Pei Dian Ying Ye 24Xiao Shi. 
"This place is famous for it's $1.30 Dim Sum, selling 24hr. Tried & taste is ok. Not like restaurant standards but certainly worth the money.
There is also a corner stall selling Taiwanese delicacy. Pretty authentic. You have to try to belive."
fast take and go...
"Easy parking, alot good food"
Affordable dimsum done well! Had the chicken feet and deep fried yam ball
Dian Xin Cai Mai 1.30\.Yi Long Chao Bian Yi.You Ren Chao Pai Dui
Cheap and ok
Food was nice and consider cheap even though price has gone up. Not much shop open at night though
"Cheap and satisfying. Long queue so be prepared to wait. Saturday 7am during a pandemic and there is already 5 customers in front of me. I Recommended their century egg porridge, Chee Cheong fun and their fried stuffs."
Cheap dim sum
Cannot go on Sunday morning..super long queue and long waiting time!
"They are getting 2 stars cos of the price - $1.30 each.  If it's even $2, I'll give it 1 star.
It was a hit or miss on some of the dimsum.  Pau were cold - not ice cold but I prefer them at least warm, not lukewarm.  Taste is good especially the coffee pau.  Forget about the charsiew which is more like minced charsiew!
Lo Mai Kai - was mostly undercooked!  Horrible.  Siew Mai, Har Kau - barely passing but I'd rather save my stomach space for something else.
Overall, I would not go back here again even at that price."
"Only porridge can make it, dim sum not recommended, taste horrible, too hard and not fresh."
Food is ok but stall helpers attitude very bad.
"Friendly staff who guided us on what is their hot sells. Ordered the Siew mai, haw Kai, chicken feet and bbq chewing fun. Tasty and value for money!"
Not nice to my taste. Not fresh.
Not bad for the price ($1.30 each) paid.
"Long Q, but really Worth the money and time!!!"
"A go to place for cheap but satisfying Tim Sum. And the operator keeps asking you to order ""Huan You...Huan You Shi Me.."" ""anymore..  Anything else"". Photo below like this,  cost $10.10 dollars."
"Been here twice and on both occasions, pretty long queue. Lo mai Kai not well cooked. Second visit I had the yam dumpling. I bet you can't even recognise it; burnt and bitter! Quality wise, for $1.30, nothing to complain. Return for more? No, both times were disappointing."
Worth the price. Hard to find a dollar and thirty cents dim sum these days.
Cheap and delicious Dim sum. I love Dim sum since I young forever love Dim sum. It will never change my mind to love it.
Great dim sum with cheapest budget
"You pay for what you get - dimsum was decent, choices not a lot but it's fine for a quick dimsum fix!"
"Like the place, but not the food"
Super Cheap Dim Sum do expect long queue on weekends
"Quite an extensive selection of dim sum. Wouldn't burn a hole in Ur pocket. Affordable at only $1.30 per menu item. On usual weekends with dining in, the queue can stretch all the way to the carpark. Be prepared to wait unless u come really early. Open 24 hrs..good for late night supper also.."
"The dim sum taste is avg but for the prices of it, cannot complaint more, remember to go along their hae bee hiam ( shrimp Chili ) with the dim sum, damn shiok and good"
Good dimsum and other stalls are good too
"Try it, you will visit there very often ^-^"
"Nice and clean environment, not too packed on a Saturday afternoon. Came here for the Ah Ma Bah Kuk Teh. Nice! Suited to those prefer the Malaysian type of bah kuk teh."
Affordable and tasty
"Cheap Dim Sum, taste not bad."
Affordable and tasty dim sum
"Dao Liao Ban Ye,Da Bao Du Shi Leng Leng De,Bu Shao Liao,Wo Chi Liao Du Zi Teng. Huan Shi Bu Qu Wu Lan De Kuai San Dian Xin Na Li Mai Dong Xi Chi Liao. Huan You Na Tian,Wo Dao Ge Bi Na Jian Mai Bei Nai Cha,Nai Cha Ye Bu Shao De,,. "
"Each item is $1.30 no matter what. Its is good and economical, yet does not loose its quality.
Not for the HOW LIAN and Atas Tai Tais or guys since it is not in a porsh restaurant to show off. But I tell you, the quality is just as good in taste. No jokes.
I give it 4 stars out of 5, reason: less 1 star from 5 cuz I don't want to be called a cheapo by these Tai Tais.
Without these people around, I would give 5 of 5 stars.
Everyone must try it blind folded. It's really restaurant standard. "
"Value for money! Bring cash for payment, and avoid peak hours (meal times) if you're not keen to queue. Chee cheong fun was great."
"Lots of parking space, mediocre dimsum, oily plates, saw many ants and cockroaches around. Definitely needs a cleanliness check from the authorities."
Cheap Dim Sum around.
Value for $ for the price u r paying for. Service much better in the day than those working after 11pm which is obviously shown in their staff attending to customers.
"Recent visit, Standard dropped tremendously. A lot of sauce not available, especially the sambal chili for chee Cheong fun."
Not too bad for the price you pay though the lady serving you past midnight is kinda bipolar
Awesome place with cheap yet delicious dim sum
"Its quality definitely worth the price.
Personally I love their har gau, porridge, spinach dumpling.
Will definitely come back here "
Good for the price can't expect much for that price but surely help with the itchy mouth at late hours 
"Decent dim sum quality with outstanding pricing where you don't break your piggy bank for a feast.

Expect a long Q if you are going for supper. The upside of the place is that there are ample seating space and parking, however if you don't drive, it is a hassle to get there"
"$1.30 dimsum, nothing fascinating but reasonable at this price point. Great place to satisfy dimsum craving if you just want to eat a lot and are not particular about quality. Favourite dish was the fried yam ball (had charsiew in it), the rest of the dishes are average.

Went on a public holiday (Good Friday, about 1015am) and queued for 55 minutes so do be prepared"
Fresh handmade dimsum at reasonable prices! Only problem is very long lines around lunch hour.
"Great food, very affordable. You get what you pay for. i.e. portion a little less than ideal. Would definitely return"
Good food but their hygiene can be improved. I was eating there with my family as I saw that the food cartons that had just been delivered were placed on the floor.
"Fang Bian Ting Che,Shi Wu Bu Cuo,Jie Ge Ye Bu Gui. Yao Jin Zao Qu Pai Dui. "
It's a good place for supper when you have craving for dim sum at night. Cheap at 1.30 but dont expect to notch dim sum
"First  time try in early morning 5.30am to fulfill my stomach.$1.30 is value to eat  but poor service  attitude ,rude and impatient service . Looks more important  in area cleaning and washing stuffs than attend customers.Spoil my mood   will not  go again and not recommend  to others. . ."
5am in the morning. The staff when service customer very bad attitude.
Very nice dim sum. Only the fat crew a bit hot tempered due to long queue.
Quality dim sum at $1.30 each!
"Bad service attitude. Went there around 3 plus am, the china lady saw us standing in front the stall but don't serve us instead doing her work and ask us to wait.
Worst is she put in new food to fried and tell us to wait cos she need to look after the food."
Cheap Dim Sum. 24 hours shop. Avoid 3 to 4am
"24hour place, nice place for supper. cheapfood"
"Surprisingly fresh and cheap. We ordered quite fair bit for two persons, cost us less than $10. This would have cost us easily$60 at a Chinese restaurant."
"Back to my favorite dim sum stall today after a few days of CNY feasts.  While looking forward to their porridge, the usual staff who are usually friendly and helpful were not there today. I chanced upon 2 other staff whom I have not met before and apparently very rude and impatient in serving the customers.

The stall owner may want to look into this seriously and not let their poor attitude tarnished the stall's reputation considering its popularity acculturated over time."
Good taste
"$1.30 per item... Tasty, value for money and fast service.

Try their century egg porridge, their char siew chee cheong fun and their steamed yam cake. Be prepared to load on carbohydrates here."
"Great value for money. Never fail to order some dim sum from here even though sometimes I come here for the Bak Kut Teh. Siew Mai, Har Gow, Xiang Xi dumpling, chicken feet, pork rib, char siew cheong fun are some of the items I always order. Affordable place to satisfy the occasional dim sum craving."
"Sent my car to workshop at Woodlands Horizons and chanced upon this coffee shop when going there for breakfast.
Saw a constant queue for this Dim Sum stall but moving quite fast as there are many assistants working there.
Ordered the siew mai, chee cheong fun with char siew. (I tabao carrot cake, dui jian and popiah later).
All the dim sums are above average and definitely super value for money!"
Price is very reasonable and food is delicious
"Definitely one of the most affordable dim sum in Singapore. Depending on what your priorities are, this might be one of the places worth visiting. I'm not too hyped about the quality, but what you pay is what you get."
"Affordable place. Char siew chee cheong fun skin quite soft. Carrot cake okay but not hot. Pork ribs nice. Spinach dumpling not that nice taste like seaweed little bitter but skin is soft. Char siew bao abit freezer smell and not hot. Spring roll taste sucks and skin slightly soggy. Siew mai combo of prawn and pork, taste okay but not hot. Ngoh huang taste okay but not hot. Have 4 staff in the stall but all rather do housekeeping and keep pushing each other to attend customers. let customer wait even though saw us but keep washing stuff."

"Dont expect too much from a $1.30 dim sum but i must say, is really value for money. I could have given a 4 stars if some if its fried items wasnt cold and soggy. I won't recommend the fried yam ball popiah. The seaweed roll is not bad.

Wasn't as crowded if you go between 5 to 7pm."
"The big pau and the( loh met kei) is okay for its price, but the fried Tim Sim is no no not up to standard."
It's dim sum by Jin Wei. Bo Cai Jiao is a no no to order.  Chicken feet is OK.  Carrot cake is not too bad.
Good price good food good service.
"24hrs dim sum place ard industrial area, each item cost $1.30, affordable and nice food, long q but shorter period of waiting time as the q moves quite fast, recommend to drive or cab/grab there as there isn't any bus stop or mrt station near the area.."
Had a good time of chatting n eating in this place on a Sunday morning.
"Worth to eat, still can improve"
Great value Dim Sum. Be ready for long queues though!
"Average dim sum but at 1.30 each it's quite ok. You pay for what you get. Staff was quite nice although there is a long queue.

Be careful not to over order because the portion looks tiny and it is cheap haha

They seem to only take cash so come prepared with cash!"
Cheap and delicious dim sum!
Fu Wu Tai Du Chai
Dian Xin Chao Bian Yi!Ren Long Tai Chang Liao!
Affordable dim sum near Admiralty MRT (2 bus stops away) $1.30 per plate of dim sum!
Hao Hao Hao 
The cheap dim sum and opens 24hrs  makes its a popular spot for supper hangout. The dim sums are pretty decent for the price tag. I wouldn't complain. But don't compare to big resturants name. For 1.30 I will be happy to come back again and happy to feast on my selections of pipping hot dim sums!
"Super value for money, almost all the dishes here are good. The only 2 that I dislike are the paper chicken and the yam cake, I've more or less tried everything else and it's really value for money. Love that it's open 24/7 too!"
Dim Sum $1.30 each dish.
Cheap & nice
Nice and good value
Bu Shi Te Bie Hao Chi
Good place to eat breakfast dimsum..crowded and long Q on weekends though
"Came here on a Saturday morning around 9+, and a long queue already in place. Took me around 25mins to place order.

Food wise is ok, portion might be small for some item but totally understandable. At this price, the value totally exceeds expectation."
Standards seem to have dropped compared to before circuit breaker. Every dim sum dish ordered tasted like any other coffeeshop dim sum stall. Wonder what happened.
Dim sum quite nice and price reasonable too
"CHEAAPPPPPP! taste better than some foodcourt dimsum, that i can assure you. Just q up and try it"
Cheap and average.
"Nice dimsum and very cheap
But need to queue very long."
nice and cheap dimsum!
Value for money. But will get quite a crowd during weekends.
Value for money.. but don't expect restaurants' standard.. Bao are good!
"Dim sum were average for $1.30. Not as crowded as other 1.30 dim sum. Went during weekend midnight, sadly no fry items available."
Dumplings are nice and delicious also most of all is  affordable.
Various choice for only $1.30 each!! Definitely worth. I believe this should be the cheapest in town.
Cheap n nice specially the chili
"All dim sum at $1.30!! Ordered century egg porridge, chicken feet, chee cheong fun, dumplings, yam cake and spring roll"
"Zhe Yang Zong Gong SGD15.70,3Ge Ren Chi. 
Mei Yi Fen Du Shi 1.30E. 
Er Qie Ying Ye Dao Hen Wan,Shi Ge Gua He Ye Mao Zu Mi Shi De Hao Di Fang. "
Food just acceptable but price very reasonable.
"Consistency is where dis place is at, not a bad spot compared to swee choon but with lesser variety"
"Cheap, and reasonable food quality."
"Affordable dimsum (at $1.30 per item) , but it is a little difficult to get to the place without a car.

The porridge is nice and warms the tummy. The carrot cake (2 pcs) is also savory. The chilli sauce goes well with the steamed items too."
So so tim sum with a long queue.....
"$1.30 dim sum where to find? 24h operation, but honestly dont expect DTF or Swee Choon standard la, but you honestly get more than what you pay for "
"Its affordable @1.30, but the taste is just ok. Beancurd skin roll is nice."
Really great price and taste great too!
Located in industrial building ground floor. Open 24/7 and cheapest dim sum
Giving 5 stars because you can't fault the dim sum at that price.  Ok of course it's not going to be like Imperial Treasure but it is $1.30 per dim sum. No big succulent prawns in Har Gaw & Siew Mai but they are tasty.   Try their fried Xian Zhu Quan. The only shortfall is ..it is in Woodlands. Plenty of parking.
"Cheap and good dim sum, can't stop ordering for more. Only $1.30 each. Portion is decent, just right for small eater like me. I read the reviews about the cold steamed items, but I think I visited during off-peak, hence the service is quick and foods are not cold.  Love their steamed pork rib, very small portion but the meat is juicy and tender. Fried prawn dumping and fried yam are a good choices.
Like their chillies too, it's not too spicy and match well with the dimsum."
"Cheap dim sum..... Ok standard...nothing special. Do ask for their samba  chilli, which is pretty good."
The queue is back again
cheap and ok dim sum
Cheap dim sum anything also $1.3
The dim sum was very disappointing.. cheap but the taste was pretty bad..
"Rough dim sum. Should order chicken feet, porridge, xiang xi dumpling.

Chee cheong fun is okayyyy only.

Skip e har gao, siew mai."
OK quality. Not many variety but it is 24 hrs.
"Dong Xi Huan Hao,Zhi Shi Mei You Gong Gong Ba Shi Dao"
"Good place in the north to satisfy late night dim sum cravings (when you can't go to malaysia for it). 1.30 per different dim sum, worth it but definitely can't compare to restaurant versions."
All dim sum is at $1.30 each . Relatively cheap . And it open quite late. Do remember only take away service .
"Attitide staffs, food not warm"
"Travelled around the world to try dim sum, I often said, it's not easy to find dim sum that's no good. Finally found one. This didn't fail badly, just some of the steam dishes are a little tasteless. Incredble price, it's good for a quick fix for dim sum craving. The foreign lady counter staff ain't too friendly as well, disappointed."
"Very good price, really everything S$1.3 and decent size. Though the taste is not exceptionally great, but given the price, still worth it."
Very worth at 1.30 for the selection of dim sum!!!
So so only
Yes it is cheap but don't expect good taste
$1.30 per set of dim sum is value for $
Cheapest dim sum in singapore
Very value for money and food taste good. A few items are a little too dry though. Not complaining considering this price point.
"Basic array of dim sum covered, worth the ride down"
"Decent food at decent price. At a flat price of $1.30 per serving, this is hard to beat, nothing much to complain about at this price. Ordered 9 servings totalling $11.70, I probably can't even get 3 servings at this price elsewhere."
Value for money
"In the weekday afternoon, the lunch crowd is definitely there, so is the weekend lunch queue too! And yes, it is really $1.30 per dish. All these (in the photo) for $31.20, shared among 6 people and its really worth, given that the food tastes really good too!

The staff copes well with the long queues as well!"
"How do you even beat this price point. 1.30 per dish, ridiculously cheap and the dim sum is freshly cooked (not sure if it's handmade but still) excellent value for money. The paper baked chicken is a must to order."
24hrs business operation helps a lot.
Good and cheap!
"Very affordable dimsum shop next to drink store, quality is rather decent.

The place is in the coffee shop"
"Good food, nice portions, fair pricing. Quite above average standard. Eat a few times already"
"I like Dou Yong Tau Foo. What! Before you roll your eyes, let me explain. Its not whats served to me thats the problem, but whats served to others that prompted me to give them what a low rating. While buying my drink, a lady strolled to their counter and told the stall assistant that their beancurd(Dou Gan)had turned bad. Now, Dou is open for 24 hrs, and without some sort of refrigeration, your beancurd is sure to turn bad in Singapore's humid weather. Dou should have known this, and taken the neccessary precautions to mantain the freshness of their products. No matter how good your food is, food gone bad should not be served to customers. It is a potential food safety hazard. Although the stall assistant offered to replace the beancurd, the lady politely declined. As for me, I feel that Dou serve good yong tau fu at reasonable prices. They are halal, which means no pork fillings in their dumplings. The soy beans are also self service, which means you can take as much as you like and add them to your soup. Dou yong tau fu taste very much like their Chinese counterparts, and Muslims can be assured that they are experiencing pretty much the real thing. However, do give their beancurd/tau kwa/Dou Gan a miss. It is a pity they have quality control issues.
The laksa yong tau foo cost $6. At the price, you get 5 pieces of yong tau foo and a noodle of your choice. Laksa gravy was on point. Usually when I order laksa yong tau foo i will order items you find in your cookie cutter laksa, mainly tau pok(Dou Pao) and fishcake, plus a piece  of cuttlefish. Choice of noodles, bee hoon. Clear cut since bee hoon absorbs broth really well. I really enjoyed my food and while your normal laksa costs $5 at average, it is really worthwhile to pay that $1 more for more ingredients. Recommended, but to be on the safe side, dont order tau kwa."
"It's good halal niang tofu. Only $5 for a set of 5 pieces plus noodles. Can't be cheaper in this generation

Piping hot soup always never lukewarm. I appreciate this"
"Very tasty Yong Tau Foo, open 24 hours. The YTF pieces are nicely stuffed with a decent amount of meat-based fillings, the green veggies are clean with no sign of any residual dirt. 80 cents per piece and most pieces look fresh."
"This stall used to be known as ""Mei Xin Yong Tau Foo"" at the previous Food Republic foodcourt at Parkway Parade.

Glad that they're still operating at a kopitiam just next to the Marine Parade central hawker centre! It's so hard to find good light meal, especially yong tau foo.

They also accept CDC vouchers! Yay. Only downside is I don't think they are available for delivery on the food delivery apps."
Extremely affordable and nice yong tau fu.
"Amazing pasta and chicken that deserves the hype but unfortunately not alot of seating there and very hot. Mushroom soup is very watery but tasty , the fried rice is nice and I would definitely go back to try more of the seafood options."
"Had the mixed grill and nz steak.
Both cooked to our liking and it was delicious and delightful!
Will definitely patron again!"
Worth the price. Big portions
"Ordered New Zealand Ribeye Steak, 2 mushroom soup and Cream Carbonara. Overall food is superb and value for money. Underated shop which u should try out. Recommended"
My fav beef burger in marsiling prepped by the same bunch of young chefs
Their half chicken is crispy and nice
Always buy food here. Meat is so tender and delicious. Servis is great. Staff are very accomodating and helpful. Definitely will come back again. Thanks Bros for the great service you always provided.
"I had this chicken chop before and it was yummy. Unfortunately this time for takeaway, the chicken chop is not fully cooked."
Wah fell in love with the place. The fried rice chicken chop is GOOOODDD. Plus the people there were friendly and the day after remembered my order. Seriously shiok sia
"Ordered Chicken chop fried rice & grilled salmon pasta (creamy) , with cheesy wedges as add-on sides, and as always, never disappoints. Salmon was grilled to oerfection, with that crisp on the skin. Cheesy wedges also was loaded with the cheese sauce. Definitely one of the best western food in Woodlands! Affordable too!"
"The taste is so yummy and price so affordable love it!
And also the location is quite easy to find. I came to 304 woodlands st 31"
Very bad Service Service 14/10/24 around 3.45pm
"Chanced upon this at Woodlands coffee shop. The Chicken chop came well-grilled with a big serving of yummy fried rice, & the Seafood tomato pasta had a generous amount of prawns & clams!

IG @pingguo301"
"The chicken is perfectly seasoned, and the lamb chop? No lamby smell, just tender goodness! The fried rice is soft with a deep, smoky flavor that's simply addictive. With a variety of options, there's something for everyone, from the kids' menu to indulgent choices for adults."
Food was good and fast! highly recommmend to come and eat it
this guys very good
"$7.80 for a delicious plate of pasta with fried chicken cutlet! pasta options were aglio olio, cream or tomato. Store has plenty of options for dishes."
Very nice 
"Fried rice is really nice.
Chicken is nice and crunchy (slightly dry). Fish and chip is delicious too. Will definitely come back here often!"
"It used to be good, but the half chicken fried rice isn't as nice. It's a bit undercooked and not as fresh. Hope they improve soon."
Food is nice
"Stayed around here and have been wanting to try out the halal western food for a long time. We came to dine in for dinner and the service given was the best!

Service was quite fast, and the food is really good for the affordable price.

Would definitely recommend and come again next time!!"
food was good and fast! highly recommmend to come and eat it
Fast service and food taste good. Frequently patron this place. Consistent quality.
"Decided to try their New Zealand Rib Eye Steak, grilled salmon pasta, half spring chicken...It was fast, just about to sit & the food is ready, probably no crowd..."
Ordered Mushroom sauce chicken chop and New Zealand Rib Eye. The foods is really good.
"Good food and great service.
Especially love the fast n fresh delicacies.
Even my colleagues enjoy coming here for lunch break."
"Honest review, food 10/10. Everything on the menu is absolutely fantastic! Service is quite fast, has a variety of courses and the taste is amazing. Definitely recommended. Although the store is in a food court, the food is restaurant standard. Try to believe!"
awesome place! love the chicken chop aglio olio! 
Super bad attitude from staff. Order steak of medium. Came well done
Ordered a black pepper chicken chop and it was delicious!The chicken was nicely marinated and grilled..the sides are also really yummy.The fries are so yumz I ate all up 
"Unexpectedly, my boss brings me lunch, and the fried rice is what  exactly I like . Will come again with my friend "
I stayed around there for almost 6 month and didn't know there's a Halal western stall.. so decided to try.. There was no queue however the food was pleasently nice.. except the mushroom soup which still need a room of improvement.. would definitely come again to eat..
"I got enjoyed my lunch, the tomato sauce is specially  nice"
"Pleasantly surprised, food (I tried mix grill)  is better than Collin's nearby and young men pleasant service.

Waiting time a bit long though as there is a queue even at 2:30pm.

I still give 5 star cause service makes up for it"
Ordered chicken chop with cream pasta and chicken cutlet fried rice. Chicken chop was really good! The sauce is light yet flavorful. Pasta was okay. Chickent cutlet is crispy. The fried rice has turkey bacon bits which was delicious too! Overall it's worth the price.
Food was nice but I ordered cheese fries and the packaging for the cheese which was packed separately just opened and my food is all covered with cheese?? Get better packaging!!
"it is located in a coffee shop, we ordered K13 from the menu, the meat is tender. perhaps can serve with a can of coke."
"had chicken chop fried rice.
the rice has wok hey and is flavourful
chicken chop is savoury as well.
pls keep up the great wok!"
"Decided to try out this halal western food stall after seeing good reviews. Shop manned by 2 chinese guys. Ordered a chicken chop and chicken with spaghetti for takeaway. Price on the high side for coffeeshop at $7.80 + 20cents for takeaway for each item. But still cheaper than Collins Common Grill just round the corner. Tastewise the spaghetti was forgettable, overcooked and too soft. Chicken chop was good though, size of the chicken chop was decent. Best item in my opinion was the bun from the chicken chop."
"Initially came for the chicken rice but queue was too long during weekday lunch hour. Hence Tried this western food, ordered cream pasta and chicken chop.

Surprisingly the pasta is quite flavorful,not the dilute kind of carbonara. Chicken chop also has a crispy skin.

Definitely coming back to try other items. Will take better pics next time coz eaten halfway"
My favourite chicken cutlet and fried rice place
"Food is always great.
And fast service."
Ordered Chicken Chop with Blackpepper Sauce. Very generous serving. Definitely will come again!
"Fish & Chips is my go-to order. Their batter is the crispy kind that I like. Unfortunately, lacking in consistency. Rather hit or miss as the batter comes out over-fried half the time.
Closes rather early for a western food stall, usually not taking in orders anymore by 9pm."
"Old  auntie has been selling bar chor mee for a long time, simple yet delicious bowl of teochew style bar chor mee."
"Bought their meatball for $6 for 6, inside have alot of ingredients. Super super yummy!! Even tho she's one person handling the entire shop, but she's super fast! Support local aunties"
"A more braised, vinegary version than the usual fare. Come support this friendly lady!"
Bak Chor Mee is delicious and the lady is so nice.
"Wanted to support Auntie again but price for Bak Chor Mee is now $6 a bowl for a portion that probably too small for most guys.  Taste-wise has not improved from the last time I ate, and texture was a bit too soggy as well.  I think I will go for $4.50 fishball noodles next time  if I want to support auntie. Sorry..."
"This is an unassuming stall with an unusual (in a good way) bowl of BCM. The dark sauce - probably the braise from the mushroom etc - imparts a particular distinctness to the bowl that I have never experienced before. Initial taste was a surprise - can't place the unfamiliar and unexpected, a departure from the usual chili+soy+vinegar taste of a BCM. The thin slices of pork were cooked perfectly. The sole fish adds salty crunchiness to the bite. The mee kia I ordered is al dente and soaked up the sauce in abundance. The angel hair pasta-like mee kia is the only appropriate option as far as I am concerned here.

This leaves an impression. One can also see how meticulous the elderly lady is in cooking the bowl. I will always cheer for hawkers that take pride in their craft - she is clearly one of them."
I have an egg allergy so I swopped for beehoon+kway teow instead of meekia. So yummy. And aunty is very passionate . Dunman FC is is also the best in sg so 5-star lah!
"A dimly lit stall tucked in a corner, run by an elder who cooks up decent bak chor mee.

U may find it a little pricey but worth it because it comes with crispy sole fish slices and pork lard.

I wouldn't say it's the best, but still, it's worth my calories. Will definitely be back if I'm in this area and craving for BCM."
Old school style fish ball noodles by a sweet old lady. Taste of nostalgia
"Not all Bak Chor Mee (BCM) are made equals and to be enjoyed on its.own right. You might need to raise your voice a little when ordering to the friendly old lady as she's a bit hard in hearing. An unassuming corner stall, I ordered a soup version adding the Fu Zhou fishballs. Thought total was about $7.50, the bowl of noodles' layout seems like I'm eating at those cafes or restaurants. I like the presentation. Patience is necessary as I see the old lady hardworking in making a nice BCM. Soup is great and unlike the clear version is filled with all taste from the ingredients. Each ingredient as its own unique taste. Even the wanton, I can quite identify that unique flavour I've ever encountered. The fishtail with the meat filling is not too thick nor difficult to bite. I like the fried fish to add flavour to food. Come and have a wait, enjoy a cold coffee nearby and the special Tao Gua Bao nearbtly before the noodles. BCM serving for my version can be quite filling."
"The noodles were abit pricey at $6 but came with a hearty serving of meat, mushroom, and sole fish.

The taste is different from the usual BCM, as its sauce is likely from beans, making it more akin to the texture of jjajiangmian. There is also less taste of vinegar than what we are used to. The bowl of soup with a dumpling and some seaweed tasted amazing. Loved it through and through.

Auntie was really friendly and cute! Do show some support!"
"Tucked away in the corners of Dunman Food Center is an unassuming Bak Chor Mee & Fishball Noodles stall run by a sweet elderly lady.

For $6, you can expect a bowl of well cooked noodles with a good helping of lean pork slices, minced meat, mushrooms, sinful chunks of pork lard, topped with two slices of fried sole fish, and a small comforting bowl of clear soup with one wonton. The portion isn't huge but it is enough to chase away the growls in your stomach.

Unlike your typical BCM, the noodles were tossed in a dark, umami, slightly starchy sauce. I can't seem to place my finger on it, but this was slightly reminiscent of the Korean black bean noodles. Different from what I'm used to, but it is by no means a bad bowl of BCM.

Do give her your support :)"
Yummy bowl of fishball noodle
"My comfort food, served by a meticulous lady who never fails to time her meat cooking perfectly.  Bak Chor mee here is not merely minced meat, but generous slices of lean meat.  Used to include slivers of liver but lately it's not included, but still fine.   The sauce has a special umami, I think from the braised mushrooms which has a hint of 5 spices and rock sugar.  Her soup is made of several meat bones and fish bones and served with a juicy wanton and seaweed.  Topped up on the noodles is a precious slice of fried sole fish or cuttle fish (I think it's sole fish).  Best to dine in, but her noodles do keep well when tabao as well, unlike other places as she is able to time the cooking al dente.

Good to see that her clientele has increased over the years.

Despite being a one-woman operation, her service is pretty fast."
"It's kind of different tastes bud that decides.
Some like it some is so so.
But it's ok to give it a try.
But still  can carry on makan."
Love the BCM!
"One of the best bowls of bak chor Mee I've tried. Stall is run by a kind ageing auntie, who takes orders and prepares the meals.

Stall has no signboard, is in a corner on the ground floor next to an unoccupied stall. So, it's easy to miss.

Noodles are soft and bouncy, and the portions of mushroom, minced pork, dried fish and lard are generous. Auntie knows just the right amount of chilli to add.

Already patronised twice when I was in the area, would love to visit again."
"The highlight of this store are the ingredients, super generous with toppings. Soup has seaweed in it which made it refreshing to drink.

Expected a traditional vinegar-like BCM, but it tasted more like Lor mee due to the texture of the sauce. Not bad by any means, pretty good. Just different"
Very delicious bowl of noodles. Auntie is very friendly and generous with the ingredients.
"Ordered bak chor mee less chilli (mee pok), which is at standard price $5.00. Old school style. Noodle is tasty with just the right amount of sauce, and not too salty. Generous serving of sliced pork. The soup tasted wonderful, and is deliciously peppered with coriander and seaweed plus one wonton. Definitely worth it!"
Terrific bowl.
"Best bak chor mee I've had! Takes a while to be prepared but is testament to the care that auntie puts into preparing each bowl. Have brought many friends to try, always successfully converted to fans."
"Hands-down favourite bak chor mee. It's a hidden gem, run by a single sweet elderly auntie. She takes a while to prepare your order, but every single ingredient is so well done, from the fishballs and mushrooms, down to the small pieces of fried lard and fried crispy sole fish (one of the best part of this dish!) Very happy to support her and I hope she sticks around for a long time."
"Really great bak chor mee, the sauce is rich and tasty, generous portions of sliced pork - will definitely return again "
"A hearty and delicious bowl of Bak Chor mee  Rou Cuo Mian from this unassuming stall at the corner of the basement of Dunman hawker Center. Auntie is very friendly, and generous with the ingredients. It has large portions of tender pork slices, minced meat, mushroom, fried sole fish and a wanton."
"It's been a while since I visited this Food Centre. Place has not changed much but they're currently putting in a lift. Was there for the Tau Kwa Pau and it didn't disappoint, even though it's changed a bit. Same guys selling it."
"It is a quiet hawker centre, so naturally the stalls have to shine in order to draw business.

There are two steamed fish stalls (also sells side dishes). OK Seafood is the stand out if you like it light and fresh. The other stall (forgot the name) is good too if you like the fish saucy. The sole chicken rice stall is very fragrant for the price but no frills. There is also a celebrated duck rice stall and wanton mee downstairs but I still gravitate to OK and the chicken rice whenever i visit."
"Dunman Food Centre, home to yummy tau kwa pau, duck rice and good coffee. Come visit in the daytime till mid afternoon. Night time not really bustling."
Love kwaychap haha
"Food stalls are mostly closed due to stalls closing early. Depending on the time, you visit, you might not need to wait."
"This is one my family favourite store in this market for dinner. These are more good store served breakfast and lunch in morning like Wan Tow noodle , peanut pan cake and dark Sauce duck noodles. Give it a try "
Good variety of food found in this little food Center. Adrian from downstairs che zhar with lots of Wok Hei. Yummy.
Nostalgic place with lots of good old days hawker by 1st gen hawker.
"Must try at Dunman Food Center, shout out to the friendly aunty and uncle at the basement drinks stall (Ah Huat Cafe) for the awesome ice kopi ($1.60). Happy Sunday!"
"We braved the humid heat and went for dinner at Dunman Food centre  tonight. We ordered the beef fried rice and ginger scallion pork rice from Ming Garden Zhi char  - was the best beef fried rice I've eaten. Great wok hei and a generous portion of beef was added. The pork dish was also very good with tender pork and tasty gravy full of ginger.  The chef owner Adrian was friendly and is very skilled with cooking Zhi char dishes the old fashioned way! Excellent experience for us, will definitely return for more !"
"The food was delicious, freshly prepared, and full of flavor. Great service and cozy atmosphere. Highly recommended for a satisfying meal!"
"Small & quaint little hawker center. Options are limited, and many stores seem to be closed during lunch, but food is quite good and reasonably priced"
"Plenty of local foods here.
If you drive finding a lot in the small carpark is quite a challenge unless you don't mind parking further away."
Limited parking lots. Tried the braised pork rice stall facing main road and it's delicious! Would be back to try many other stalls here. Overall it is clean and airy hawker centre.
Steamed fish very fresh
"Missed this wanton mee, Joo Chiat Ah Huat wanton mee. Still the best, Succulent noodles with tasty wanton and soup is not so salty!   "
Dunman Duckrice is One of the best duck rice around the area. Could get a decent plate of duck rice. Duck is tender and flavourful and gravy has a hint of herbal taste. Their Wantan mee also one of the best in Singapore
A wonderful stand alone food Center on the heart of Joo Chiat with amazing food offerings. The basement level offers robust coffee options and there is a halal stall serving up amazing mee rubus and lontong and the curry puffs have that old school tastes that you can hardly find elsewhere. Overall has my and my recommendation to satisfy the hunger pangs :) enjoy!!!
"Since 1959, the original duck rice and Tau Kwa Pau with fabulous accompanying chilli sauce is an absolute local delicacy. The fresh tender duck with yam rice gives the best idea of the origin of duck rice. All Singaporean favourite Tau Kwa Pau with the gourmet touch that brings back all generations of foodies. Yum yum."
Downhill since 10yrs ago.
If you enjoy braised duck. This will be the ideal place.
"MUST TRY!!!
B1 duck rice (stall facing main road)
L2 Prawn noodle (left corner last stall)
Satay and chicken wings (centre row corner stall face inward)
Mince pork rice Ru Rou Fan (center stall facing main road)

Wantan mee and taukuapok honestly to me so so only."
Many stalls inside with great Singapore Hawker fares.
Duck rice kway chap is awesome
"I find most older food centers have great food. The prawn noodles was simple, old style but reminds me of what I had from the street stall which used to sell his on a bike. Simple in ingredients but v robust taste wise. There is also a tau kua pay stall which I am looking fwd to trying!"
"I hardly go to this hawker centre, until my favourite hor fun stall moved here.
Stall is in the basement, and the hor fun is still sooo good.
Other noteworthy dishes- prawn paste chicken, kung bao chicken, dry beef hor fun, sweet and sour pork.
I have not tried everything yet. I hear the salted egg chicken is popular.
I have yet to try the other stalls.
Wish the tables were bigger though. Parking can be hard to find."
Is this place wheelchair accessible
"Nice and clean environment.
The rojak is still very good. So is the prawns noodle and the Wan Tan noodles."
"Tau kwa pau as good as ever.
Vadai still the best in my opinion. The wantan mee I didn't enjoy as the noodles were soggy and the char siew tasteless."
Value for money meals
"Believe it or not, this place has some of my favorite food stalls in Singapore! Some of these vendors have been around for at least a decade, so be sure to check them out before they're gone--these hidden gems won't be around forever!

Downstairs:
- Ah Huat Wanton Mee - A must-try! The spicy wanton mee and chicken feet are packed with flavor and just the right amount of spice. (Sells out by mid afternoon)
- Duman Duck Rice - Choose from rice, kway chap noodles, or porridge and add your ingredients. The flavors are rich and comforting! Super cheap and yummy! (Might sell out by dinner time)

Upstairs:
- Prawn Mee - The soup is incredibly flavorful--naturally sweet from the prawns, yet light and smooth, never thick or powdery. Their prawn mee comes with kang kong, lean pork slices, and whole prawns (unlike other stalls that cut them in half). Highly recommend adding $1 for extra ingredients --plus, the uncle is super friendly and adorable!  (Open for the whole day)
- Hokkien Mee Stall - Everything on the menu is solid, the hokkien mee ingredients comes with pork, prawns, spring onions, lard, and egg, making it a wholesome, satisfying dish (unlike some places that serve largely noodles). Their carrot cake is also a must-try!
- Western Stall - Great pasta and meat dishes with generous portions at affordable prices!
- Rojak stall & Popiah stall - A true taste of tradition, perfectly balanced flavors.
- Roasted Meat Stall - Five-star restaurant quality for their roasted duck and char siew with spicy chili sauce!  (Usually open for lunch)
- Sichuan Zi Char & Other Zi Char Stalls - Perfect for family meals, the spicy dishes, steam fish and delicious flavors are great for dinner!

Don't miss out--go try them before it's too late! (Check the opening hours and days with the stalls)"
There is a new malay food stall at the lower floor 
I think $20 for assam fish head is reasonable. Small food centre but environment is nice.
Great food
"I have been eating lot of places for the bean sauce steam fish head, but this stall OK is one of the best ones that had. The fish head is fresh and well cooked. The sauce Is superb! The steam meat and sambal sweet potato leaves were fantastic.. highly recommended.. and price is reasonable."
"This De Ming duck rice stall was situated at Duman Hawker centre basement level and was not easily spotted. The kway chap was nice and not expensive at all. The bowl of kway soup was light and has herbal taste in it. The egg was not over cooked or hard as the egg yolk was bright yellow with no green stain . Portion of dish was big.  Duck porridge portion was big too. Not many people knows this old place. Quiet, traditional and relax place to have your meal. Very Worth to try out here."

"A lot of steam fish stalls on the second floor. Tried the stall at the back of the hwaker. Fish flesh felt like baby backside. Melts in your mouth.

35$ for 2 pax with fish & vege. Worth it."
Went back to get Tau Kua Pok whichbis just 2 dollars a piece reasonable and added a piece of yam fritter already is a lunch for me. The only issue is very few stalls opened on Sunday :(
Delicious steamed fish head from different stalls and other zi char items.
"Couple of steam fish stall in the evening, all the stalls are pretty good. Tried OK Mei Wei this time, pretty long wait (50mins) but worthwhile, the sweet potato vege well flavored and the black bean fish as well. $33 for 2 pax - tasty food at affordable price!"
Take note that only 2nd level is opened for dinner and not all of the stalls on 2nd level are open.
Very delicious and fulfilling breakfast
Zhe Li Zao Shang Lou Xia Ceng De A Fa Yun Tun Mian Hao Chi. 
"The fish ball noodle from the Bak cho mee aunty is really tasty,the aroma from the soup and the mee kia is great,I recommend eating the noodle dry first then later put noodle on your spoon then dip in the soup and eat it,legit shiok.But the noodle wasn't a lot so had to buy something else to fill my tummy"
A great hawker with a lot of good food store
Ah Huat wanton mee is the ultimate comfort food. Great balanced wanton mee with one of the best braised chicken feet around.
Nice Western Stall. Chef previously from a 3-star hotel. $7.50 for Black Pepper Chicken Chop is worth it. There are crinkle fries & spaghetti.
"Jie Ge Shi Hui,Shi Wu Ye Hao Chi"
"Minus a star cause it's quite limited in shop choices, however the few shops here are pretty good, the wanton and duck rice in the basement is something I'd recommend, then there's zhi char and braised pork rice on the top that's not too bad too."
Hawker centre but price on the high side.  Recently I think the prices are in-line.  Usually I will go for the Wantan noodles at level 2.  It's kinda different for their chili and noodles type.
The duck rice at basement is really good
Nice! Great food
Rojak is excellent.
"If there's a 0 star I would just give a big 0.
DO NOT patronise SHENG XIANG KITCHEN . They served food without cutlery in the pretext that we ordered from another stall similar to theirs. In the first place, how can one serve food without cutlery ?? Male owner/staff even
mentioned not to order next time, it was so unnecessary when we just asked for utensils. encountered such unpleasant service, I will never order from them anymore! An advise to the couple there- if you have no business. Don't take it out on your customer. They are ultimately your only customer. Nin Ting De Dong Ma?"
Dying food centre with many store closed. Yet to identify a outstanding store.
"Had traditional prawn noodles...$4, a few slices of prawn & pork... asked for additional pig tail & was charged $1 more...  nice"
Very quiet on a Monday. Chicken stall and Braised Duck stall is most popular.
Great and fair pricr satay and steam fish head and ehome fish zhi char.
"Brilliant food, tried lots of options. Everyone was so friendly. Worth a visit as it opens early if you're there see the beautiful houses nearby."
Ah huat wanton mee
Floor & Tables are always kept clean.
Had Hokien Mee and Wanton Noodles. Devious.
"Recommend Ah huat wtm, Rojak, Prawn noodle, soya bean drink, poppiah, steamed fish, vadai and chicken rice."
Rojak is great!Need to wait for 15 to 30 minutes depend on the Q
"Kway chap best. Soya bao, rojak, zi char near toilet all good."
Sheng Xiang Kitchen..the Song fish head with special sauce was really good at $20. Lots of lard toppings . We ordered Ngoh Hiang too.
"If you love fish, go for OK Fish ..... Bean sauce steam seabass, kang kong is my favorite. If order steam fish you may need to wait for 15-30 mins."
Great steam fish. Price no change
"Hands down, the best Rojak in Singapore, JB, and Batam - Lau Hong Ser Rojak at Dunman Food Centre is a must-try! It's a game-changer, trust me, it's SO SHIOK!!!  Mr. Lim, the owner, is not only an expert in his craft but also a charming and humorous host. While waiting for your order, he'll regale you with stories and jokes, making the experience even more enjoyable. What's impressive is his dedication to preparing each component by hand, including meticulously cutting every piece of cucumber and pineapple. With 50 years of experience under his belt, Mr. Lim is a legend in his own right. Don't miss out on this culinary gem! 5/5 stars, no question!"
This hawker centre may be quite small but has a few notable stalls.
Simple local fare.
"Food is good but queue system is just a facade. They do not follow first come first serve, but rather, serve whoever they please. When confronted, they first insisted that it was according to first come first serve, when pointed out clearly who came after me, then script changed to orders being taken by different people. Which is a lie too. So if you want to eat their food. Do go and chase for your orders. Else you will be waiting like a fool"
"Nice, clean, food centre. Bottom floor is cooling while top floor is hot. Not too busy"
"I just simply love the rojak here. Absolutely the best in SG, in my opinion."
The prawn noodles is just so tasty and delicious.
Awesome char Kuay teow!
not bad but not good.
"A small Hawker Center . Small and have only 20+ stall. 2 level.

Afternoon time, it is hot inside. Night time is better. But quite crowded in the night.

Food is nice . Should visit if there is a chance."
"It's a hawker place that allows for dine in and take-out. But it's non air-conditioned and since it's pretty hot lately, probably would be ideal to not dine in. Free seating with limited public parking lots. Possibly have to park opposite off Onan Road.
Otherwise food is great, delicious and definitely wallet-friendly. $2 for each tau pok and can add any of the extras to make it more filling."
"Quaint hawker centre but with loads of variety, not like the chomp chomp or Newton. The choices here is so wide from wan tan mee, duck rice , tau kwa bao and many more.."
"Finally found the long lost ""Ang Moh"" wanton mee!"
"Hen Duo Shi Hou,Chi De Bu Zai Shi Wei Dao,Er Shi Hui Yi "
Love the Hakka minced pork rice at second floor. Tried the steam fish was nice too
Xiang Tong Zhao Pai De Dou Gan Bao Xian Shi De Wei Dao Yu Zao Qi Zai Jia Dong Ru Qie Jiao Jie Chu De Ka Pei Dian Shi De Zi Wei You Tai Da De Chai Bie!...
Amazing food at this hawker centre and hard to believe value.
"This is a relatively small hawker centre located at Onan Road in Katong. Despite its small size it has three zi char stalls and two duck rice stalls. I had the wonton noodles which is very reasonably priced at only four dollars. This stall is very popular and it opens from 7am till 2.45 pm or till sold out. Noodles
are one of the better ones that I have eaten. If you eat here, do finish your meal with a soya bean drink manned by an elderly couple. Tekong Soya Beans and Curds is one of the oldest stalls here, about four decades. The original stall was at Tekong Island, hence the name."
"Ordered and tried the pancake (Mian Jian Guo) with peanut and Gula Melaka Coconut one each this morning.  A
surprisingly the taste of Gula Melaka  Coconut was really excellent and I think it is one of the best I taste so far.
Close on every Mon and Thur."
"Dunman Duck Rice in the basement, and the soyabean and wanton mee at the top level are recommended eats!"
Totally amazing
"Particularly pointing at duck rice located at Basement. Lovely food and service. Have to wait for slightly longer, BB it it is worth it."
"This hawker center, located along Joo Chiat Road, is home to a variety of delicious local dishes. For example, Say Seng Famous Tau Kwa Pau offers a unique fried firm tofu stuffed with braised egg, cucumber, fried fish cake, and fried yam bits, all doused with flavorful braised duck sauce. Don't miss their duck meat, fried fishballs, and fried yam slices as well. Dunman Road Char Siew Wanton Mee serves up delicious wanton noodles. Their homemade egg noodles are thick and supple, making for a satisfying meal. And the delicious steamed fish head by Fu Xing Mei Shi.

Remember to explore these stalls when you visit Dunman Food Centre. It's a great place for both locals and tourists to experience authentic Singaporean cuisine!"
limited number of stalls. Parking lots are limited. Good for supper.
Not much stall open the time I visited.
Try the wadei at basement. Not bad.
"Dunman Duck Rice sell Kway Chap! Heavenly taste, never have you gotten cleaned out intestines and perfect ""fat-less"" skin. Collagen over load!  If you are into reducing ""fats intake"" this is the stall i recommend. I have been eating there since 25+ years. Their taste never change. same same consistent! Besides the aunty is already old and still helping out in this stall! support support!

YUMMY IS THE WORD!"
"Good food,  I suppose you and I have eaten Ang Moh wanton mee, taken over by investors.  If you still missed Anna Cooking, may be you can try Ah Huat wonton mee, basement at Dunman  food centre.   Enjoy folks!"
"Wah his rojak prices now is expensive, not worthwhile to go to patronise"
"The downstairs Duck rice and kwap chap considered not bad but the old auntie attitude very rude. I corrected my order but get scolded by this very rude auntie as my order was wrote wrongly by her. No more next time, really rubbish."
Food is good taste as it's was like before.. best Tua kwa pau in Singapore.
Ok place to go
"Dunman wanton mee close second stall at geylang lor 29 ..moved to bedok blk 216 hawker center , starts at 6am"
Place for Kuey Chap and Tau Kua Bao.
"Agree that this is one of the BEST Hawker Centre in Singapore, great food, great community!"
"Best popiah I have had.
The tofu was good too but I'd prefer for it to be warm. It was a bit cold already, but the TauFu sauce was very good."
The food here still taste traditional hawker food. Clean place and toilets.
"Nice wanton mee n zhe char store, prawn mee n best rojak"
"This is my childhood food center. Always brings back nostalgic feelings. We have seen stalls coming and going. Like the Eng's wanton Mee who later went from famous to nothing. What a waste of their father's legacy.

The food center has a few more noteworthy stalls :
DOWNSTAIRS
The one and only Tau Kwa Pau in SG - the standard has dropped but hey, it is still good and there is no where else u can buy Tau Kwa Pau.
The duck porridge is exactly how I remember it to be, as a child
Vadai : the famous Gina vadai vs Bjaj Vaday - both are good ...my personal favourite is the latter
 the food & beverage stall sells home cooked barley. Excellent.

UPSTAIRS
A couple of steamed fishes stall with Tze char dishes
The best rojak in SG: not sure how long this stall will remain open bec the uncle I remember from childhood is getting old
Tekong : sells decent beancurd

There's a wanton Mee stall upstairs and one downstairs... imho, both CMI"
"Went around 6.30 and not much stalls left , prawn noodle and western food is good. Satay also good too"
"You have too come here.Cheap & Good Hawker style food. Prices are cheaper in my opinion for certain stalls. Daytime & Night stalls are sometimes different.
We live the Chicken Porridge upstairs, the Duck & Kway chap stalls downstairs (closed on Fridays). Make sure you go to the Kway Chap Stall as there are 2 stalls selling Duck
The Chicken Pork Porridge upstairs is run by a lovely old Chinese Lady and man. $3-50 for a bowl of Porridge with egg. Really nice.
The Duck Porridge is $3-50 lots of duck and ginger.tastes really good.
This Hawkers centre is a hidden Gem in Singapore as it is normally not crowded and there are seats for your family & friends"
Great place to sit and have some authentic quick  cuisine
It gets quieter in the evening. However not all the stalls will be open.
Probably will come back when more stalls are opened. For now the Wanton Mee I ate is good and the drinks are good too.
"My parents like the wan tan noodles here and frequent this place. Popped by with them to enjoy breakfast.  mostly always a queue here, but once you've ordered, you'll b given a number. You can take a seat as there's a number display to collect your food when it's your numbered being called."
Great food but building needs refurbishment.
"Simple, not crowded, delicious, nostalgic. Must try dry prawn noodle"
"Always the go to place when I think k about braised ducks,  the best so far and really efficient on getting food on plates or to go... even with long queue, it's relatively fast."
"So so food but long queue. Husband and wife team, I go eat to support local hawkers and food. Small food center not that many varieties"
Generally clean place. The rojak stall is over raved I think.
"Simple food, simple seating but great food! MUST come!"
small food centre with authentic and nice dishes
Still think it's one of the best rojak in Singapore
Lower floor's dum briyani mitton for $8. Generous chunks of meat.  Go try
Chinese Pork Satays! Reasonably priced and nicely bbq.
"As with all good hawker stalls, please go during off peak hours if you are in a hurry."
"Not many stalls open in the evening, however, we had satay and soya bean curd."
"This is one of Singapore's oldest hawker centers.  There are several great stalls located here:  teochew duck, wanton mee, and tow kua pau."
"Went for Sunday lunch around 11.45am. Not crowded. Ordered and got our food within 10 mins.

Had the kway chap (noodles) and it was cooked well. Really enjoyed the soup as well. The duck was tender and not dry. Sauce for the intestines/egg etc was a bit too starchy for my liking, but flavour was good. Would come back again purely for the kway chap and duck!"
"The fish at Fu Xing at level 2 is a must try.
Value for $"
"Came here in the afternoon for a quick rojak fix. Still decent, though not quite mind-blowing. Uncle very friendly!"
One of better Kway chap and duck rice in the island imo. The soup is light but has the right punch of herbal and stock. The meats are braised till they are soft.
A few good stalls in this Hawker.I have rated individually rather than the entire Hawker Center.
"Typical hawker centre with plenty of food stalls around. Very clean, wantan mee and the duck rice is very good."
"Lots of choices of good food.
Downside is the parking.
Better to visit non-peak hours to avoid crowd & to find parking lots."
Food are good (especially prawn noodle & Rojak) price are reasonable ...
Old style hawker centre. A good reminiscence of the past in the 70s or 80s. Gina's vadai is the favorite there. Kway chap is so so only.
"Ate Char siew and Sio bak rice from Long Yuan on the 2nd floor, Sio bak was nice and crispy and char siew drizzled with the sauce ,meal was complete with complimentary clear cabbage soup which was flavourful. Repeat visit for me."
"In the morning before 3pm, try Ah Huat Coffee found at the basement Coffee brewed to its best and reasonably priced compared to all the cafes literally littered along Joo Chiat Road. The place is unassuming and you can go along your coffee with nice Malay offerings like lotong, vadi. The Chinese stalls served wanton mee and all things duck, with kway chap, duck rice to boot.

Coffee is still my best recommendation. $1 kopi o, where to find ?"
Delicious food.
"Had kway chap ($4.60) for lunch on 17/6/23, was good."
Love the claypot here
had briyani mutton from basement side for lunch not bad.
Lin braised is fantastic
Food is not that great.  Satay at 80 cents is rather expensive.
Food never keep warm
Small simple but good place. The food is good and hawkers even chat with you.
"Breakfast review!!!

Dunman is a great place to eat especially if you are in the neighborhood. You get a choice if not just one but two really popular wanton Mee. Both are good and both have raised their prices. Can't be helped they say,.... The basement one has risen by a lot more ...

The porridge on the upper level is excellent and if the taukwapau below is open you should pair that with whatever you are eating.

Don't bother with the kway chap. It's only so so and I was quite fed up when I bought the ""half duck"" portion only to get home and realise there really wasn't half a duck. Who are you trying to kid here?? Just because you debone you think I wouldn't discover that it wasn't half a duck you gave me??

Please..... just increase your price if you can't serve half a duck. But don't pull a fast one on your customers!!"
"10Chuan Sha Die +2Ge Ji Chi 11Kuai
Cai Tou Guo Hei 5Kuai
Ku Gua Tang +Xian Yu Zheng Rou Bing +Fan 12.5Kuai

the bbq stall really good! the soup also good!"
met this place by coincidence. tried the crispy pork rice and turned out it was very good.
Small 2 level food centre. The place is packed with good food. Parking is limited. Packed at peak hours. Prawn me was good.
It's quite small and the options are limited but the food is quite delicious from the small number of stalls here.
"Wanton mee was below average, noodles and flavour was just off. Mutton briyani texture was alright, but the flavour was super intense and amazing."
"$1.20 soya bean milk v plain
Prawn noodle chilli nice but prawns very very small"
Good simple
Nice but I have no idea why they are so slow lol. Like isn't everything cooked already? 
"Great selection of food, food tasted awesome, good good good price. Can't beat it for value to taste."
Smacznie i tanio
Awesomeness
Reviving childhood memories here with the famous Tau Kua Pau that used to be sitted at the coffeeshop opposite the old Katong Mall. The wonton noodles was not bad either (not the best). Finding a parking spot will however be a test of patience.
I eat Rojak
"Great food centre that hosts a lot of good food! The ambience is also good with loads of seats. I was able to find a seat every time I'm here.

So far my experiences here has been great, compiling my reviews below:
Duck rice - 5 
Ah Huat Cafe - 5 
Tekong tea stall - 5 "
the duck and layered pork are tender and flavorful. intestines can be more springy and kway chap more silky. just need that extra mile. price is reasonable.
"Wanton mee, duck rice, rojak, steam fishes and chicken porridge bery nice."
Limited choices in the evenings... better to go in the morning.
Good food with affordable price here
"I'll come here for wonton noodles and ""tau gwa bao"" next door! There is always a queue for about 30mins. They start as early as 7am and are closed on mondays. You can also order extra fried wonton or braised chicken feet. I dont think you can find ""tau gwa bao"" (fried beancurd with filling like fish cake, duck meat, cucumber) top with duck gravy and chilli anywhere else as tasty and as original! I would also add their fishballs, fried yam and braised eggs on the side. They just go so well together! If you still have time, head up to the second level and try the rojak. Almost every stall here has a queue! There is also satay and steamed fish head with soybeans that you can also enjoy! Too much food too try!"
My family to-go stall for duck rice craving. Always a pleasant experience and satisfied meal every visit. They are very economically priced too.
"Walking along Joo Chiat road and as a hungry Muslim I don't know where to eat and had no expectations when I saw a hawker center. I took a chance, I saw halal food on the first floor when I climbed down the stairs. No halal food on the second floor."
Small cozy place serving typical SG hawker food.
Fresh fish nonya style. Amazing
This hawker centre many good local food but most are closed after 2pm
Very nice rojak..uncle and auntyare nice
Old school taste. Like it very much.
Hor pau not available elsewhere
"3 stars but then again, it's a hawker ctr !  Attraction is old hawkers who are still selling same dishes like Tau Kwa Pau (moved from Katong) and Hokkien Mee Soup !  Lots of other choices so chk it out for yourselves if you enjoy hawker culture !"
"Quite a good mix of food choices. Some favourites there which are tasty. However, there are stairs to climb so it may not be so accessible. Limited parking lots as well so be prepared to park your vehicle elsewhere."
Great prawn noodle here!
had a very delicious chicken porridge and taufufa here. the price was cheap given the portions.
Nice uncle and auntie nice food too
The best wanton i would say and very spicy chilli.
"Located along Joo Chiat Road, Dunman Food Centre is one of the smallest hawker centres in Singapore, with less than 30 stalls spanning two floors.
Oh ya, with clean toilets."
Small but full of tasty food store
"My fave is Dunman wonton mee, taste like old days.  Dont let the wonderful sauce be drowned out by the spiciest chilli!  :-)"
Very tired hawker centre atmosphere.
"Classical hawker centre
Mee pok on basement corner store cooked by a old lady is awesome"
"I love this food centre. I've eaten in most of the stalls and never had a bad meal. Particularly enjoy the wanton mee, bak chor mee, rojak and Taiwanese pork rice."
Best char kway teow I have ever tasted .. auntie is very very friendly and accommodating to request
"Small market but jam packed with hidden gems of amazing food.

Best dry prawn noodle in SG can be found here and under $4. You can't find such a good deal anywhere else.

Grilled fish is extremely tasty. Great meal for 2 people just pair it with 2 bowls of rice. Be prepared to wait as the queue is always long.

2 types of duck rice available here: (1) Traditional yam rice with duck meat and choice of duck organs, sides like taupok; (2) White rice with duck meat drizzled with special sauce and options of fishball. Both are extremely yummy.

Chicken rice shop here is a gem too with perfectly cooked chicken. Dish is different from the usual chicken rice but still very tasty."
"Nice sauce to the rice, duck is decent. Preparation time is super long though, be prepared to wait."
The place is small and lack of parking lots.
"Love it, a lot of various food stall. Halal and non halal food has different tray return booth "
"To my surprise, this little gem isn't as well-known as it should be. Excellent food (my favs are the steamed fish stalls and popiah - So far the best popiah in town), clean and well maintained dining area with super clean restrooms (unlike everywhere else when it comes to foodcourt's public toilets)."
"We were here super early at 10am .
We ate only from Food stall that were open which was.

1.Gina Vadai - chili was fresh and contrasting taste with the vadai. Yums
2. JooChiat Wanton Mee - noodle was al-dented and little one loved it. Recommended.
3. Tau Kwa Pau - filled to the brim like most people said.  Would eat it without the accommodating chili sauce. *just my preference*

We wanted to eat the Satay as were craving it only opens at 4pm.

My only gripe was that parking is was horrible. Parked 400m away which was a Public carpark near Joo chiat"
Another under run hawker centre with only less than half the stalls open
"Best duck meat, best kway chup i've ever tried. Been patronising this stall for years. Their soup is also very flavourful, duck meat is very tender. Price range is very affordable."
Need to get an uplift. And also check store food quality. I think some stalls are selling bad food after hours.
"Limited food choices as it's a small food centre. Half of the stores are closed during weekday lunch. Parking are hard to find.

Tried the duck store. Don't be fool by the emptiness of the store even though it's not lunch time. There are many people ahead and the stall helper cooks very slowly and forgets your order. Be prepared to wait for 20 min for a plate of rice. Cant image during lunch time.

Won't bother queuing for it unless my lunch break is 1 and half hours."
"Clean, well ventilated food centre. Good wantan noodles"
Great porridge stall
"Lots of goodies at this gem of a food centre - Tao Kua Pok, prata, wan ton noodles, Malay Kueh, etc...  All good!

I think basement shops are closed on Monday.  Wanton Mee still there.  Malaysia style with power chilli."
Yummy yummy food
This kway chap is really thumbs up. Their braised duck meat is extremely tender. Didn't have to wait long as we were there early.  The kway chap soup has a lingering herbal taste that's not overwhelming and complement the main dishes. A truly craftsman who perfected this cuisine. Hopefully they do not go into those franchise business and lower their standards like so many traditional food stalls doing nowadays.  Also tried another stall that sell Wanton noodles which was just average. #dunmanduckrice #dunmanfoodcentre
"Duck very dry and coarse now, not sure what happen but no more queue even on Saturday lunch hours."
Very good and cheap food. Highly recommend the tau kwa pau and Gina Vadai.
Roast delights for meal lovers
"Saw many tables ordering different fish dishes, mostly steamed or fried. A little quiet corner where locals gather for affordable pleasures that their hard earned monies can buy."
Don't ever buy from char kway teow store. No taste and full with egg shells...
"17 Nov 2022: Enjoyed the tau kwa pau from SAY SENG FAMOUS TAU KWA PAU...nostalgic street food. Generous filling and the chilli is super shiok...love the fresh taste of sourness in each mouthful. We also ordered a plate of fishballs plus yam fritters and the combination is really amazing.

31 Mar 2022: HENG HENG PRAWN MEE SOUP...an old school type, nice and warm comfort food on a wet day.

17 Oct 2021: Satisfying lunch from DUNMAN ROAD CHAR SIEW WAN TON NOODLES and MY PANCAKE for desert...Yummy!

20 Aug 2021: A food centre with reasonable number of stalls serving yummy selections. Some of my favourites are Lau Hong Ser Rojak, Dunman Road Char Siew Wan Ton noodles, My Pancake, Soon Kueh from First Delight and the Tau Kwa Pau."
It looked very clean and nice after the renovation. My 3rd time dining over here. Food is good but it was a long wait. Prices were reasonable too.Have takem notice that not all food stalls were opened on Sunday evenings. Would love to try other food stalls on my next trip on the next time round.
Many steam fish stalls. Average $20+ per fish.
"Visited on 30 Oct 2022, for tao huey and sugar cane drink "
Have a nice plate of wanton noodles. Be wary that the chilli sauce can be a little too spicy to some
My fav stall is actually the minced meat noodles at basement..auntie cook 1 bowl by 1 bowl like a robot repeatedly..very good bak Chor mee and very nice soup
"At 3pm on a sat noon and still needing to wait 20mins for the food. It's pretty average, not sure what's the hype though"
"Nice old school food
Nice cheap prawn noodle n fish soup"
"Nice little coffee shop food center located at a prime estate. Tried to rojak which is highly recommend, speed is fast and won't be waiting too long. There are many stores selling duplicate products such as steam fishes and zi char items. Parking is quite a problem here with the amount of restaurant and private housing. Recommend to take public transportation to avoid waiting 30 minutes for a lot"
"Heard and read so much about this FC. Decided to finally try it but honestly, there are many other better ones. Many stalls were closed on a Friday afternoon (about 130pm) and we ended up only being able to try the wonton noodles and the tau kwa bao both located on level 1. I will definitely not travel back to this FC for these 2 items. The overall FC is overdue for a renovation and with so many stalls closed, there is completely no vibes one typically find at popular FC. Overrated IMO."
Nice deck rice
Got very nice pancake there
"Amazing Breakfast Meal.

Porridge with Steam chicken...

Yummy."
"At the basement - The Kway Chap is very smooth, good portion and soup was nice, not too salty. Duck was soft, pig intestine texture was light and chewy. Generous portions so giving them a 5 stars. Service was slow though, but stall owners were friendly so ust be a bit patient will do."
food delicious
"The chicken n pork porridge/congee are good, my friend like the fish dishes..There is a ground floor food stalls which I only noticed when I was leaving.. The toilets n hand wash area are clean.."
Good choices of food
"The best ever. Love the duck, the rice, the sambal (wished they are a bit more generous w this delicious sambal) the herbal soup, the taukua.... I can't find another stall value and taste wise to match."
"Breakfast at Ah Huat Wanton Noodles is a must.

Tau Kwa Pau stall is the only one I know of in Singapore which offers this comfort food that only Katong Area knows off.

Duck rice stall and Gina's Vadai are also stars."
"One of my favourites in the east. Has a few stalls that sells steamed fish head, worth a visit"
Because of covid many good shops are gone
I enjoyed the prawn noodle as well as the rojak. Good quality n inexpensive.
Gravy was too sweet. Rice was decent.
"Great place for a cheap and good prawn noodles. You get 2 decent prawns with lots of slice pork or pork ribs at $3!!!!! There is a good wonton noodles and a reasonably cheap zi char stall runs by 2 China couple. For see hum lovers, there is a stall which carry a reasonably big see hum. For lunch, there is a good tau kwa pau at the basement. The vade is superb too. Heard there is a great curry puff stall but they only open 2 days on the weekends."
"A small hawker centre. Despite this, there are not many stalls, so choices are limited. The ceiling is low and ventilation is poor, so rather claustrophobic. A few stalls are quite good."
Worst hawker center.. cleaner happy chit chatting and insisted diners to clear Zhi char plates themselves.. very rude as well
"Taste - good
Price - average
Service - friendly
Location - parking problem
Summary- I will be back !"
Friendly chap at stall.  Prawn vadai didn't disappoint; big prawn compared with others.($1 ea)
"Update 2022: price is only $3.50!
2020 Where can you find good duck rice for $3 only?! More than 50 years history, second generation and still going strong! Basement of Dunman Road Food Centre."
Alot of nice food. One of the best hawker centre
All good except for the intestines having the smells because they were probably not cleaned properly. So that is a fail and a turn off for us.
"Many stalls were closed, so not much choices.... "
Fantastic!!! The duck was soft and juicy. The rice was tastily cooked in gravy. Broth was lovely. Sambal mixed well into the rice delivered delicious morsels each mouthful!!!
"Dim inside, fair ventilation, doesn't appear clean. Tau kua pok n wanton mee n brauised duck stall still very good"
Always able to enjoy something Great here but the challenges are to get a parking lot.
"Smallest hawker centre in Singapore (?) but with many nice local delicacies. Ah Huat wonton mee (resurrection of Ang Mo Wonton mee) , Say Seng Tau Kwa Pau, steamed bean paste fish heads (3 stalls , each are tasty and unique by their cooking style) and many more.
Best place for simple family dine out and also to recollect childhood taste and memories "
You Hao Duo Gu Zao Wei Mei Shi
Great food at every stall.
Duck rice at lower level front is good and reasonable price. 
The Kueh Chap at the basement is a must try!
Option not much but business is good. Maybe reasonable pricing. Especially the fish head 
Fish head and wanton noodle
"Loved the great food sold in some of the stalls. e.g... wanton noodle, tau kua pau, vadai.....the proof is in eating as shown in the photos."
Good rojak & won ton mee.
"great food, home cook style. famous for steam fish"
"Prawn Mee, Wanton Mee, Rojak, Pohpain, OK Zi Char 100% HK and many many deliciou foods "
Not sure abt the hype surrounding this duck rice kway chap place. Around 40 mins wait time for a mediocore kway chap and braised stuff. Sauce doesnt really go well withe duck and the braised meat is meh at best
Good wanton noodles and duck Rice
"Above average wanton noodles.
The chilli was rather one dimensional in taste - could use a better stock to flavour the noodles.
Portions were generous ."
The duck rice is good but the portion of meat is not much as compared to the rice. Be prepared to wait a while as this stall is popular!
Not many food stalls are open
"Small food centre but with a couple of really nice makan stalls - satay, zi char, etc. Stalls on the lower level open in the mornings; and, stalls on the upper levels open in the afternoons and evenings."
Seems it has never changed since 1980s
Superb Wanton Mee
ate western food....hmm...3/5. cheap maybe at 7$ for pork chop .
"Tried the OK tze shar. The dishes seems salty, fish is small portion, average taste and the fried eggs ordered came thin slice. Overall, average and long waiting time."
"3.5 stars. Better than average but VERY slow. Average turnover time to serve 1 duck rice is several minutes, way slower than most duck rice stalls.

Food quality:
Duck is tender, soup is piping hot, rice is a little hard.

Food portion / Price:
Still rather affordable $3.5 for a plate of duck rice or porridge at average portions.

Service:
Order, get buzzer, then collect food and pay.

Crowd:
Expect some crowd especially during meal time.

Payment:
Cash only"
Perhaps for morning crowd.  Most stall are closed by late afternoon.
Crowded place. Good food
"Dunman Duck Rice, an honor to witness 3 generations working together "
Excellent service
Roast Chicken available
The kway chup is a must try.
The prawn mee n wanton mee my fave..d rest r ok too..
"Tried the wanton mee, the noodle texture, sauce and even the chilli was very similar to Eng's wanton."
Steam fish too old & meat is hard .
I used to support the old couple hokkien Mee and oyster omelet but recently it's change to a young guy seller and cook. The food ain't the same as it is and it's hard to go back to something different
Only few food stalls open from 6:30am. Car parking is limited outside the food centre. Can park across the road next to Police Post.
Very good place for Fish Head and Min Jiang Kueh!!
"Came for the Fish Head dish and Wanton Noodles.
I will definitely go back for more rounds."
"Worse duck rice experience ever. The eggs are the smallest I have ever seen and over cooked. Hard as rocks!! The intestines are not cleaned properly.

The sauce is tasteless. Definitely below average duck rice store."
Quite disappointed with many good stalls disappearing.
"One of the BEST Hawker Centre in SG, ancient taste and value for money, definitely will visit again soon !

Wanton Noodle - $4 for large ;
Dou Gan Bao $4 for 2 pcs ;
Lu Rou $4 ;
Hot Soy Bean $1.1 and so yummy !! "
"Located at the Junction of Joo Chiat and Koon Seng Rd. Normally will be here to buy the Tao Kwa Pau. Bought some recently to eat at home but was disappointed to find that some of the Tao Kwa were half filled with the ingredients. Cannot find a similar stall anywhere and missed the original authentic taste which i supposed was lost when the business waa passed down.
Would advise everyone buying to open up the box and check before leaving.
Happened to find this uncle sitting on the pavement doing his sketch work on one of the building. Not there usually, so no need to waste time looking for him."
"This food center is open till 11pm to 12.00am. Good place to get a unhealthy but delicious oyster omlette or fried kway teow. Bbq chicken wings, otak and chinese pork satay available too. The rojak stall is famous too...
Update: 1st may 2022, the fried oyster omlette is now damn expensive and very small portion. See my pic. The taste is bland and the chilli is very salty. The old couple is no longer selling. The stall is manned by a young man and he closes at 10.00pm. I rate 1 star for that. Give this stall a miss. I will not even try the char kway teow or hokkien mee. I really miss the food by the old couple. The other food are all still good."
Good food and pleasant atmosphere. Tables clean.
"Stalls selling wanton noodles, tau kwa pau and duck kway chap at the basement are good. Prices are reasonable also."
Not many choices
"Seats & stalls are quite limited, but the rojak stall is popular. Some stalls open till quite late too."
Gina's Vadeh is magical as always please support her shop. Best in this region! Take fresh green chili with it
Steamed fish galore!!
Nice and old style hawker food. Good and affordable. Parking is limited during peak hour.
many good food there
Small hawker with shops on 2 floors with a variety of food and drink stalls.  Tried the fried tofu pocket stall.  The food is yummy with great sauce.  Plenty of seats but might have to walk around to fins an open ones as some seats are still blocked off.
Go for the stuffed tofu and duck rice.
"Recently upgraded and refurbished with new tables, seats and facilities. All the good old local delicacies are still operating."
Don't come here till this CB is over if u plan to dine in. Very limited sitting.
Great place for hawker fare. Parking might be a hassle.
Our lunch $19.80 includes a Kway Chap meal and a serving of braised duck. 
"Good food, esp the rojak there. Prev tasty frog porridge gone but still a wide variety of  good food there, such as the new zhu cao stall there taking up the previous spot of the frog porridge, highly recommend the fish dish with rice, worth a try. After renovation, the old design of the hawker centre still remains, but everything looks new as before!"
"Long queues for the popular stalls after covid-19 reduced requirements. 1 hour queue for Tau Kwa Pow,  Duck Rice  and Wanton Noodles!"
Many old favorites have stationed themselves there... however parking there is not friendly.
"Parking island challenge, food may be over rated"
love the hawker food selection..also the convenience of public transport
A recent make over with previous stalls doing a thriving business and can be very crowded during tge weekends.
Food not nice prawn mee. Prawn  is not fresh. Price not cheap.
It's my all time favourite Tat Kwa Pau there & it's the 1 & only stall in Singapore.
"Unassuming Bak Chor Mee at the basement of Dunman Food Centre. Auntie is very friendly and will chit chat with you while she prepares your order. Basically, she's doing it to pass time and her children are all grown up. Lots of ingredients for $3.50. Taste is not bad at all! Well balanced with tinge of vinegar and chilli. Will be back to support her!"
Chicken porridge is good. The chicken is tender and the skin is thin has very little fat or not at all. Wo Xi Huan De Kou Wei
"Wanton mee at level 2 is open for business but basement is not.. bak chor mee and fishball noodles stall is not bad for alternate choise, auntie sells teochew fishballs, its good."
The stall selling rojak is delicious.
cool and clean environment with delicious hawker food.

"There are certainly better places than this average tasting duck rice. After tasting this for the first time my companion asked me why the long waiting time and the long queue.i can understand her sentiments becos although the duck meat is not tough it is lacking in flavour. No one likes gamey tasting duck meat but if the meat is also tasteless, it's no better. Try it only if you happen to be there and don't have to wait too long."
"Probably due to the rise in local transmitted cases recently, not many stalls are open. Also, lesser people come for their meal at lunch time. The usually crowded coffeeshop next door is suffering from thin crowds.

Am here today to try the pancake. Ordered 1 peanut and 1 red bean. Personally, I think it's average.

Wanted to order my coffee from Tekong Tea Stall, nobody was manning the stall. 

Instead, ordered grass jelly drink for $1, taste kinda weird. Not the usual taste I knew it for.

Ordered another Soya bean milk drink $1 and bean curd $1.20. There are better than the grass jelly. Bean curd is soft and sweetness is just right. Soy bean milk is a little diluted, but it's alright.

The best wanton noodle here is the Dunman Road Char Siew Wanton Mee! Add their chillies if you like it spicy. 
Don't need to try the other stall, it's .

8 Mar 2022, back here after their long closure, can't tell what has been upgraded.

Anyway, soya bean milk, grass jelly drink and bean curb increased $0.10. They still taste no better than my previous visit."
"Clean environment, bright, and airy.

Decent mix of stalls."
"On a sunday afternoon, 80 percent of the stalls were closed. Basement, both Say Seng tau kwa pau and the wan ton mee were off. Gina Vadai were sold off by around 4pm."
"My favorite hunting ground for wanton noodles. Be careful with the chili, very spicy"
Great place for steamfish
"Visited after renovation.  Place is clean and tables are well spaced out.  However the safe distancing measures meant less seats available, especially during lunch (and likely dinner) time."
My favourite place to have steamed fish head. Reasonable price too.
This food centre was fully closed for renovation from Dec 2020 till end of Feb 2022. Scheduled to reopen on Mar 2022.
Small Hawker Centre but full of delicious & special food.
I come here for the tau kua pau. Parking isn't readily available. I usually need to circle a few times and wait before finding a lot.
Good food and reasonably price. Understand from hawkers there the food center will closed for renovation from 1st Dec.2021 until 28th Feb. 2022.
"Small hawker centre by Singapore standards, but chock full of stalls that serve high quality food that's stood the test of time. Currently undergoing renovations and will only re-open in Mar 2022, so you'll need to get your fix of chicken congee, duck rice, wanton noodles etc... from elsewhere unfortunately."
Go there to buy famous vadey.
There are nice food stalls which gathered long queues. Level 2 got the chicken rice. Basement has the wonton mee. Both gathered long queues. Wanted to try say seng tau kwa pok but it was closed.
"My favorite stalls here. Like the rojak, poh pian, wanton mee, steam fish. Not to mention the tak  kwa pow."
Nice selection of local delights.
No carpark.
Very nice and delicious chilli / wanton / noodles
This particular stall selling steam fish head with various choices. The pricing is reasonable and stated clearly on the menu. The quality is good. It's fresh. It don't give you those dead fish taste when you chew. It's worth to try.
"I like Duman Market, usually will go there for supper. In the day time they hv Tua Kua Bao and  by nite is Rojak.. like these two items very much"
"Very nice Kway Chap!
Very smooth, soft tasty kuay chap and surprisingly soft and tender big intestine. I paid S$4 for 1 bowl of kuay chap, large intestine, pig skin and tau kwa for 1 pax.
Nice seller too!  I will be back! Yum yum

Can pay either by Cash or PayNow."
"Amazing char kway teow! $4 for small, $5 for big, and the portions are really huge compared to elsewhere. And it's really good, not too oily, you wouldn't feel too jelak while eating. A definite must order when you come by!"
Not much varieties..but have nice wanton mee.
Love the spicy wanton noodles here
"Sliced Fish soup from Lin's Braised is not bad (having added dark soy sauce and their chilli).
Dived in straight w/o a photo of it."
I loved it.
parking problem even on weekdays!
Whole lots of good food that you'll be spoilt for choice.
Support the local businesses...
"Long wait and the store owner kept telling me it's ""not long to wait"" and I only got my (one) order 25 mins later. The food was not overwhelming and would really have wished they've been more candid in estimating the time."
The Rojak is very  nice but very hot inside the hawker
Some of the best hawker food found here. Lin's Braised Pork Rice for example.
unfortunately most stalls are not open in the mid afternoon 
"Great hawker with good food - duck rice, wanton mee (upstairs  one a bit salty for me), love the minJiangKueh upstairs and also the Vadai at basement (super friendly aunty)."
"Lots of stalls were closed at mid afternoon.
Stalls which which drew ppl from across the island were no where to be found here, probably the current situation may hav taken a toll on many."
Buy my lunch after morning walksupport e hawkers
"Clean and airy, but only 9 parking lots."
Steamed fish stalls here are good
most stalls are closed 
most of the stalls are already closed when we came here around 3pm 
"Lau Hong see rojak + bean curd
Taste 5/5
Portion to price 5/5"
Small food centre but have a lots of good foods.
"Nice variety of food. Wanted to get the tau kwah Pau but sold out at 1230pm on a Tuesday.

So took wanton noodles at 2nd level and chicken rice at 2nd floor close to entrance. Both are nice and their chilli is not for the faint hearted.

One bad point is that parking is limited. Very limited!"
"Don't take the wanton noodle in the basement.  It was extremely salty   Go for the one on level 1.  Very good,"
"Tau Kwa Pao, Rojak, Duck Rice, Vadai, and so much more... All I can say is.... Good food!!!"
Long Yuan duck  and the curry highly recommended
"The Rojak is delicious but gotta wait at least 20 minutes,  worth waiting."
"The wanton noodles and kopi was good, however the hawker centre wall mounted fan was running at full blast it make our hot drinks and food get cool off very fast. Please reduce the fan speed!!"
Famous tau kwa pow stall closes early. 4 pm  sold out
Good but not Excellent as the branch in  Chinatown: the shaved ice is not fine enough; and gula melaka could be more generous. Worth a try though.
Glad that Old Amoy Chendol opens here at the neighborhood! Same great taste and consistency as the Chinatown one! Definitely one of the best chendols in town!
Nice food centre with a few niche foods
"I like verdi as they were featured in tv programme. I bought 2 prawn fritter. There are many choices like vege, tofu, cheese and ikan billies. Pancake with peanut or coconut or red bean filling are sold by young lady. Famous tauku is sold out fast, by noon they are packing up to go home. Porridge, wtm, chendol and soya bean are all gone by 13 pm."
"A small Old style charming hawker center with about 20 stall on 2 floor. Some famous traditional good food such as Winton Noodle, Vaday(indian Fried Dough, delicious) etc..."
A few decent places to eat but carpark is quite limited. But... It's a small hawker centre anyways.
"Houses quite a number of popular stalls that hv been around for years.  Tau kwa pau, wontan noodles, pork porridge, duck rice, rojak & vadai."
Found a new branch of Old Amoy Chendol at the ground floor. Great bowl of chendol on a blazing hot afternoon.
Nice and refreshing chendol at 2 dollars each. 20 cents more for takeaway.
"Excellent chendol!! (#01-07 next to Gina's) Bought one bowl to share but had to go back and buy a second. It was just irresistible with the thick gula, coconut milk and nice red beans n soft chendol. "
Very nice rojak stall here!
"Bought this to try as the regular stalls i tend to buy from were closed. I was mainly attracted due to the good price point of $3 - a rare find for duck rice in Singapore.

Portion size is reasonable. For this price, you don't get the braised nuts, egg or tau kua like other duck rice.

The rice is alright but not exactly the kind of flavour that I enjoy. The duck was nice and tender if not fatty. The sauce that covers it tastes good.

Not a fan of the chilli. The sambal is ok but the other watery chilli seems to be only mostly vinegar."
Parking is so ltd..
love the char kwah teow ...
"A less noticeable food centre from old time with limited seating, given the small building. A few popular stalls have very long queues."
Duman food Centre bring us a delicious food and drink. Convenience for the residents when they are hungry easy for them to get theirs food and drink.
The Tao Kua Bao used to be at East Coast/Joo Chiat Road junction is here at the basement level. Gina's Vadai. Boneless duck rice too are great
Food is super gd
Ah hiat wan tan mee very delicious  
",,

, Zhen Yu Tou Zhen Zhu Rou Bu Cuo You Liang San Dang Ke Yi Chi,"
Favorite rojak
Love the western food there & not forgetting the sugarcane 
"Several stores with long queues!!

Eaten Xiang Gu Rou Cuo Mian at the basement level, done by an elderly lady. Nice and chewy for the noodles and the sauce is not the regular fish sauce taste, this is more minced meat tasting. Even have the flatten fried fish bites!!

Nice food centre for yummy tasty food."
"Smallest hawker centre, some nice food."
A very good standard with great sauces to spice things up.The braised duck was also tender and delicious.
Only two floors with limited stalls
Found some nice food store such as the Yong tau foo and Indian snacks
"Good Wanton Noodles, Rojak and traditional  Hong Kong steamed dishes"
"Driving out with my partner to look for his supper at midnight but Newton, Old Airport, Tg Katong were all closed, finally found a rojak stall open at Dunman Food Centre. Partner said it tasted delicious and stall hawker was so kind to remind him the car lights were still switched on and was very grateful we came to support. Honestly we are very grateful to find his stall open after traveling so far from Balestier."
"Well after watching food for the m
Nation channel 420 everyday i saw and listen to Gina vadal so i go all the way from yishun before i go to the learning to check out some course.so sad to early she was not there but her sister was just frying for others order i though of trying all the vadal but i only got what at the counter
3 prawn,1 samosa,3vegetable that all only $9/ very cheap so by 09.15am than i reach paya lebar skill future and try by first bit at the vadal"
Chicken rice best
"Dunman Food Centre is a relatively small hawker centre with 2 floors of stalls. However,  the variety of food is quite good. There are a number of popular stalls that people queue for the food, like the duck tao puo, wanton mee, chickenrice. The Vadai stall also offers good tasting variety of Vadai, my favourite was the prawn vadai. Good place to get reasonable good food, but very limited parking lots. There is a public carpark but around 100m walk from the food centre."
"Old school place, bring back pleasant memories"
"Heng Heng Prawn Mee, first time having it and I just had two bowls.  delicious and just $3!"
Plenty of good food at affordable prices. Nothing over-rated compare to stalls which they post in Facebook.
"My first visit Dunman Food Centre ... its a small food centre ... consists of 2 levels ... an old school food centre ... first ordered a dry wanton mee, then ordered pancakes ...

The noodles used for the wanton mee at first glance seem too thick ... never seen this before ... after mixing with the sauce and chili well ... it turned out rather nice ... a little tangy ... not too soft that i expected of thick noodles like this ... the chilli is spicy ... made me perspire alot ... the wanton is small but turns out juicy in the mouth ... i didnt finish it all ... keep my stomache for the pancake ...

Ordered the peanut + peanut but pancake ... very fresh ... not so sweet ... not too dry ... just right ... goes well with the soya bean drink ...

A wonderful breakfast exploration ... good experience ... really enjoyed it ... have a wonderful weekend"
"Hidden in plain sight, some good gems including the wanton mee here."
Only the tau kau pau worth the eat
My favorite wanton noodle!!
Many sites were not opened
"A favourite place of mine for delicious hawkers' fares when I was in the East on the early 80s n 90s.

Recently been there a few times for zhi char with Fu Xing Mei Shi.

Good value n friendly services.

My favourite is the Nonya Fishhead, samba sweet potatoes leaf n salted meat cake.

Only downside is too few parking lots in front of the hawkers centre though opposite there is a small public carpark next to the neighbourhood police post.

Other famous stalls r the Prawn Mee, the 'slow motion' rojak, the dou hua, etc.

Try this hawkers centre if u r in the vicinity."
"Lots of good food here, wanton mee etc."
"Duman Food Centre is one of the early days Food Centre that was built.   I remember this place since 1970s.

The food centre is spread over 2 floors.  The 1st storey is more like lower basement and 2nd storey more like 1st storey.

The food centre is very small and should be able to make a roundup of each floor within a minute.

There are some good food to be found here and some stalls attract a queue.  Experience varies with customers."
"Dreary level one, 90% stalls closed....why?"
"After reading the ""Help our hawkers google map"" information, we would like to do our part in helping our hawkers around out. We searched for our hawkers near our place so that we could have more frequent support of them.  We found one hawker Dunman Food Centre.  There was  this elderly lady selling Fishball & Minced Meat Noodle. She was in her 60s and has no online or social media platform. Her stall was at the basement corner along the same row as the popular Wanton Noodle and Tau Kwa Pau stalls. The noodles were quite chewy and we safely said it could match the popular Blk 85 Feng Shan Bak Chor Noodle. Aunty was generous with the ingredients and portions. Her Wanton was delicious. She was pleasant and cheerful when we patronize her stall. We observed that she prepared her noodles with lots of care and love. She was slow but meticulous.  Her portions were really value for money.  We were there to buy from her a few times. We discovered that aunty was a quiet lady and fond of reading books to past her time.  Please try and purchase from her as she does not have many customers."
Must try the black carrot cake and Hokkien Mee from the 2nd stall on the right up the stairs and the rojak is on the left of the stairs
nice food here!
Always carrying the favorite food
"Was here at 730am. Limited parking lot but probably due to pandemic, need not wait long for a lot. Only a few stalls were opened when I arrived.

Tried:

1) Ah Huat wantan noodle, average rating,
2) Say sent Tau kwa Pau and braised duck. Chilli is nice. Rated above average and,
3) Peanut pancake. I'm a fan of peanut pancake and I like it especially the ones with corn and peanut.

Will return next time at a later time to try on other foods."
"Dingy place with nearly nothing on the menu. The place is so small, 2 level of stores maybe totalling 25 stores at most, but absolutely insufficient seating (not a problem now because no dining in due to government restrictions).

Western stall serves very poorly prepared food. Oil was not fresh, the process of cooking was much less than hygienic (luckily my dish was deep fried, hence everything living would have be fried to oblivion). The chicken cutlet was the taste of the oil, the side dishes cannot be changed.

Basically, will never step into here again. Period."
"Wide variety of good food choices from braised duck, rojak, prawn mee to steam fish head!"
Good memories with the duck rice on the ground floor before covid restrictions.
"Dou Gan Bao good
Parking difficult"
Not many varieties of food stall during day time.
Parking Problem.
"Parking is a perpetual issue.  Unfortunately, the only hawker center around that area. Poorly conceived and designed."
"Nice double-storey hawker center that offers good wanton mee, stewed chicken feet, minced pork tau pok, and braised meats. Old school vibes with loud big fans, the place is not squeaky clean, but decent enough to enjoy a quick meal."
Some nice food here. Say Seng's Tau Kwa Pow is goid but their duck rice so so. Parking is problematic though.
"nice chicken porridge
nearby coffee shop got famous prata stall"
"Xiao Xing Xiao Fan Xiao Zhong,Bu Hao Ting Che"
"Enjoy the rojak and the prawn noodle was cheap n good. The noodle chilli was tasty but not too spicy. The rojak stall is famous and I waited for like 20minutes for my order. The zi char steamed grouper is fresh and he try to get my mom n me the smallest fish as request. Price reasonable. Overall, Damai Food Centre is my mini food paradise."
"Food were excellent, definitely much more reasonable than you can expect.
The hawkers there running their businesses unexpectedly long hours. You can find yummy foods there as early as 7am till as late as 2am! Yes! Hawker's food!
However, during peak hours, parking lots is always a problem like elsewhere."
"It is an excellent opportunity and ideal place for supper and breakfast. It serves an extensive wide range of local food Choices. You name it, you have it. The famous stalls are the wanton mee, Fried Tau Kau and not forgetting the Frog Porridge. My favourite hawker centre in Katong."
"Dunman food centre is a place I wanted to visit since long, but being a vegetarian I would always step. One day I decided finally to go their and explore if I could get veg options. So I saw a mala shop. Mala is an option where u can select ingredients that you want in your pot right from sea food , meat , herbs , vegetables and to accompany them with noodles or rice.
I am sure every local in Singapore is aware of mala and have eaten it once. The food centre was very neat and clean. Social distancing was nicely followed. 5 on 5 for me."
Had early breakfast at Rong Ji Chicken Rice & Porridge stall. Very nice and tender chicken & smooth porridge. Reasonable too!
Great carrot cake and rojak stall that was open even at 9.30pm
"An old hawker centre that has been there for as long as I can remember as a child, it's famous for the duck rice, tau kwa pau and wanton mee stalls that tend to have a queue. However, I do think the tau kwa pau stall is one of the stall worth queueing up for because it's a unique dish and the dish is very filling too!"
"Steam Fish head at OK!, $15 for half a big fishhead and $5 for a big plate of Kang Kong. By far this is the cheapest fishhead and vegetable I had in a Zichar stall, and not to mention it's fresh and taste good. Will be back to try other dishes soon!"
"Always love coming here for steamed fish head, popiah, vadai, soya milk, prawn noodles, rojak, etc!"
"Parking is really an issue there. Tried the zi zhar stall at the corner - assam fish, sambal kang kong n other dishes there. Price is reasonable n food is satisfactory. Tried the tofu with some meat stuffing, supposedly duck meat. Quite unique and interesting. Chix rice and wonton noodles must be good, seeing their queues are very long. Will try the food at my next visit."
"The Wanton Mee on Second Floor ....In the middle...Next to Pancake and Chi Zar stall, is good but I am certainly too picky as I benchmarked to the Fei Fei Everitt Rd in 80s n 90s. Have the potential...closest match to FF comparing many WTM I tried in SG. Keep it up dude. Not easy since I stayed quite far and tried 4 times already and not easy for me to eat WTM at a stall more than 2 times. A big fan of FF old days WTM. Keep it up."
Old school hawker with many food options
"It's considered as a small sized food centre with a handful of mavelicioys

It's a very small food centre. The food there is good. The only problem is the parking. Very limited space.
Most of the stores are closed on Monday.

"Damn hard to get a parking lot here.

The famous tau kway bao is at the basement  level."
"Do try the Western food
Great taste
Set comes with spaghetti, fries n coleslaw"
"Fishball Bak Cho Mee stall is a gem! She adds ingredients not common to BCM like pieces of fried fish, 5 types of sauces and wonton with flat fish bits in the filling. Soup is great too!"
Wonton noodle nice
Just another food centre with stalls catering to the needs of the neighbourhood
"Parking is plently if you do not mind a short 2min walk as the parking lot in front of the centre is very limited but there are many parking spots around the area. The famous Say Seng stall that sells popular tau kwa pau which you can eat with their fragrant rice. They also sell pork belly, braised meat & eggs. It is a small two storey building and it has a very clean washroom situated on the second floor. Not suitable for the wheelchair bound as you can only access both levels via the stairs."
Go there for the Tau Kwa Pau which is very good for $1.50 per piece. The coffee at Tekong level 1 is good too.
Nice Asam fish
Please kindly try this hawker rojah at night.
Great wanton mee
Small hawker. Food ok ok. Very very hot even though it's at night. Cleanliness can be improved.
Have some nice eateries here..
Easy parking
Small hawker center with many heritage stalls and good food.
"Relatively small FC, but have many good food.  My only gripe is so difficult to find parking in the area."
Most was nice m but very few stores operating at night.
"Bought Coconut & Peanut Pancake from #02-18

The main attraction is the 'Tau kwa pau ' but the other food are nice too.
Came here for the delicious chicken and pork porridge
This place has quite a few yummy hawker stalls. Go explore!
Fantastic Tau Kwa Pau at basement.
Well managed food centre with plenty of food options to choose from.
Most of the food stalls were closed.
Maybe I went on a wrong day most shops are close
Good fish head and other Cantonese dishes
Good wanton mee and chinchow of level two!
Wanton mee heaven
Best Fish Head in Singapore
soya milk store
Good late night food
"The place is OK, but when it's crowded everyone don't have any 1m meters apart,"
"Awesome place for makan. 70% shops are great. My regular stall is OK, origin from Hong Kong. Their popular dish are their steam fish, as there's no msg. Many stalls like chicken rice, Wan tan mee, porridge, duck rice and so many great tasting food not mentioning The Rojak Halal foods on the lower floor s lemak!!! My favourite kuek lapis."
"Most stores at the basement usually closed from late afternoon onwards, but like the kway chap here."
"love the kway chap / duck, worth the travel from the west!

the soymilk and rojak feel homey, lovely old couples running the stalls

HOWEVER... the carrot cake omg, cannot make it, mushy and red in colour x.x"
Excellent food.
The bean curd bao at basement is a must eat!
Wanton mee & tau kua pao are so good. And much more food I would love to try! Hope to come back soon.
Best rojak
Very nice rojak
The wonton mee here at level 2 is the Gu Zao Wei kind. Do let them know if you want less sambal chilli!
Chicken pouridge is good. Upper level. But coffee stalls are all not open even at 940 in the morning.
"Clean hawker centre despite old. Many fans making it airy, while I like. Wanton noodle and duck rice are my favorites here. Limited parking space in front though, more challenging if you drive."
"Dunman Duck Rice. Koay Chap very smooth and thin, soup not oily but flavour ful. Dish of intestine, lean pork, ears, very good"
"Quiet place to Dine .And If you are thinking of Eng's Wanton Mee this is a place you can also eat and While yoy are there you sunk your teeth into the once famous tau kua pau the traditional tau kua filled with pork slices ,cut  fish ball and delicious chilly sauce or thick black duck sauce to go with it . And if you are thinking of pure beancurd this is the place for it n many other stalls almost four selling steam teochew whole fresh water fish in Black bean sauce with vegetables cook in different style .Try it and you will know the old fashion hawker market place famous for many years in Duman Road ."
Cool place
Great food at good price. Too bad too many seats were blocked.
"This place has limited seating with the social distancing measures leaving most seats empty - they should re think about this.

Ordered the  Hokkien mee and it's $5 for a small plate, taste okay.

Rojak was a hour wait and super not worth it - has a burnt taste."
Food there quite nice.
"OK Steam Fish Zhi Char, cheap and good. Fish are really steamed fresh with good variety to choose from. Good value for money."
Good food and reasonable price.
Nice char kuey teow
Getting quite a bit of crowd nowadays. The steam fish from the zichar stall is most popular.
Lots of nice local food.  Just that not all stalls are opened when i visited it.
Rojak is super good but slow so be prepared to wait
Awesome kueh chap !  Love the duck meat. My favorite place for kueh chap.
Great selection n friendly shop owners
"It was an impromptu meetup in the East with the sibling and I get to know of Duman Duck Rice Stall at the last minute. On top of words of mouth, its ""Singapore Best Food"" award and other media article plastered on the stall's shelf had given me the reason to try their food out.

A waiting time of about 30 minutes is required and we agreed. With many other stalls in the hawker center being closed during then, we had not much choices of ordering other food but to wait patiently.

The taste was not in my expectation and I find it quite ordinary. Gravy was luscious in taste and gave a subtle bitter aftertaste perhaps with the strong use of herbs. Surprisingly, our platter came with Star Anise to compliment the presentation of the dish. On a side note, the broth of the Kway was not as fantastic as I thought and the Kway consist of some ""noodle"" taste that was not in my favour.

Kway Chap Set for 2 with Duck Meat - $11

In my honest opinion, I find that it's not worth the wait and there are many other places that provide tastier braised duck as well as Kway Chap."
Go for the frog legs porridge.
"Hokkien mee,wanton noodle and the traditional tau kwa pau u must try.The zhi char stall is also quite popular too"
gina service is very good and beautiful
There is a great duck rice stall at the basement. A little uncomfortable eating there. Next to this centre is a 'coffee shop' with great crispy roti prata
"Lau Hong Ser Rojak Lao Hong Sheng Luo Re... Aromatic! The drooling can only be stopped by eating it soonest! If 'Wok-hei' is for describing fried dishes, then what can I use to describe the tasty 'Mars-bar' chew-on-it effect on the sweet sauce with juicy acidic pineapple slices.
Definitely, this dish is a piece of Art..."
The black bean fish is good pricing. Small hawker but nice
"Small food centre and no place to park. But place is clean, including toilet and some tasty food. Fish dishes, noodles and porridge is good. Prices are excellent, but sometimes seating is hard to find, take note"
"Good rojak, wan ton noodle, Xia Mian Tang, duck rice,  Dou Gan Bao and steam fish head/pork ribs/salted fish with chicken"
Seafood lover
the western food taste not bad.
A small scale hawker center with some popular stall. Convenient neighbourhood eating place.Limited parking lot.
A small food Centre with not much to look forward to.
rojak good
Great environment with really friendly cleaners. Great ventilation and fan coverage.
You can find some good foods in this quite old place.
Very hard parking
Achievement unlocked - managed to get lot no. 1 at Dunman Food Center. This place has the smallest car park in front of it and across the road. Everything is easier on a bike 
"Lots of nice food. Don't over eat, just come back the next time."
"Where can you find soya bean water and grass jelly $1 now ? Aunty still selling @$1 big cup , do support local food and the drinks stall manage by 2 elderly . Worth Drink"
Amazing steamed fish across from the drink store
Pork porridge and steam chicken best
Probably the best duck rice in Singapore in terms of the duck. Very tender and finely sliced. Soup is also very flavourful. Kway chup is a must try too.
A tad too small and squeeze with really limited number of seats available. Be prepared to order takeaways if you have no time to wait for a seat. Quite a variety of foods despite its small location.
"Second floor wanton mee, pohpiah, corner stall black signboard tze char, and, basement tau kwa pau. Fooyohhh!"
Parking very very limited....
"For those who love to eat fish, here is the place, you can have it, steam/fried, there are some stalls selling prawn noodles, chicken and duck rice, this are very special, but the hawker center is not handicap friendly, there's no ram to go up/down"
Nice foods
"Went to Dunman Food Center to but from Say Seng Tau Kwa Pau. Frid beancurd with traditional fillings like chicken, fish ball and many others. Very tasty and highly recommended to try. Its very tasty.."
Spoilt for choices
Not enough drink stalls
DE chicken feet and the dumpling is very nice
Tau Kwa Pau is still giving a satisfyingly snack at a reasonable price of $1.50.
Small size hawker centre and without much parking space but the rojak there is mouthwatering
"You will get the best mala hotpot, the authentic taste you only in singapore. After eating feels so numb but it's a Amazing experience. I recommend to try once if you in singapore."
"fried kway teow stall at second floor was delicious, portions a tad small but still enjoyabld"
"Not much varieties. Very limited options.
Small hawker centre with limited parking space"
Ok Mei Wei value for money.
Delicious n cheap Mala hotpot. Good chicken wings and cheap fish dish. Nite time nice and cool. Toilets are clean and doesnt smell. Highly recommend.
"Popular here in the evenings are the Chinese rojak, prawn Mee and fried kwayteow"
The stuffed young tau foo is excellent.
Come here for the prawn noodles. $3 to make your day a little brighter :)
Exotic seafood that is rare but sitting capacity  has been reduced to half due to Corvus 19 distancing
"For a tiny hawker centre, the proportion of good food available is ridiculous."
Nostalgic yet offers a decent amount if food choices. Reasonably priced as well. Very clean for a food centre.
Affordable but fresh prawn noodle
Old school hawker centre with lots of good food!
"Jin Wan Xiang Chi Lao Hong Sheng Rojak Mei You Kai,Huan You satayChao Fu Jian Mian Chao Guo Tiao Gan Xia Mian Dou Hua Xian Cao Gan Zhe Shui Xiang Yong,Huan Bu Cuo!"
Tau Kwa Pau is nice .
Not a breakfast-friendly place. Most of the stalls are closed and the options are limited to about 6 stalls (including the  drinks stall)
Confort food at its best! They have so many local favourites which is soo good. Their prawn mee is quite authentic. And their tau pok sauce is one of the best in SG!
Say Seng Taukwa Pau is world--famous.
Pork & Salmon porridge all re very. Very traditional chicken stall managed old couples.  At level 2. Be prepared traffic is very busy & parking lots are limited.
Nice little hawker centre. Split into 2 storeys. U could find most local favourites there. Always worth the visit. A little warm though.
Decent food options with great wonton noodles. Spicy sauce though
2 of my favorite stalls are the wanton mee with killer chilli at level 2 and duck rice & kway chap stall. $3 for a packet of boneless duck is hard to find nowadays during Covid 19 CB period!
You cannot beat the common hawker food. It favors the tastebud of the nation. I love the uncle and aunty who have worked there for years. Thank you for the best food!
Clean place and you can also find lots of good foods there.
"Love the following food from Dunman: prawn noodles (soup or dry), Lau Hong Ser rojak, Tau kwa pau (the best you can find), prawn vadai"
Very bad queuing system. Buy only if you have time to waste. Inefficient deployment of manpower. Processes food really slowly
Suggest to try the duck rice and zi char.
very poor queuing system
The Best Chines  Rojak be ready to wait up to an hour
Good food at affordable prices.
"Went for tau kwa pau, still taste the same after all these years "
"Level 2 wanton mee was quite good especially the wanton.
Level 1 kway chap was not bad too. The taste was special as compare to the others but overall was great."
The rojak is good!
Great variety of food at an affordable price.
Lau hong ser rojak the best set b
Nothing much here..
"The hawker centre has been around for ages. The famous Engs Wanton noodles used to be at the lower level. There was a wanton noodles stall that opened at night. It was good but closed after a short time. Don't know why as the business was brisk.
The Lau Hong Ser rojak is one of the best rojak stalls. And opens till late. Just had a $3 plate; price starts from $2. Good as ever! The owner has an excellent memory and gives you an accurate estimate how long you will need to wait. Super courteous as well.
Others stalls worth mentioning are the 2 zichar stalls."
Must try the duck rice at lower level. On upper level - go to the right hand corner for a stall run by an elderly couple. Nice n delicious home cooked style zichar.
Good old local Singapore good soon to disappear
Mostly Chinese food
The steam fish is fantastic . Being eating the same stall past 20 years.
Good food with many choices. Gave it only four stars because of the cleanliness of the toilets...
Good food. Lunch and dinner even supper

Very few old hawker centres in Singapore.

Different varieties of food. Reasonably priced.
"Jia Ge He Li,Jiang You Wei Chong"

"Though small compared to others.
It still has enough star hawkers to usher you
In. Tau kwa pau  is still my favourite situated
At de basement with another brown sauce duck. Wantan noodle with its fiery hot sauce
Remains the key stall on 2nd floor. As night comes, try the satay bee hoon."

Home of the original Katong Tau Kwa Pau.
Few stall sell nice food but is a small market
Wanton noodles
"There are 3 shops you must try : wanton noodles on basement floor and wanton noodles on level 1. Both are excellent.
The best one is the Cantonese cuisine on level 1 next to the wanton noodles.. their menu has only aro 10 items, all are authentic Cantonese. Try the steamed fish head $15!"
What does one expects!!!!!
So this MALA hotpot place is part of FU XING seafood  place just behind the hotpot place. Nice and fresh ingredients from the MALA Stall. Owner is friendly and very open to feedback so as to improve on his dish.

"Try the Rong Ji chicken rice, the breast meat tastes really good! Don't forget to eat the chili."
"Lack of car parking space is a killer. Not many hawkers are open during the day except for well known Dunman Wan Tan Mee. Walked today, 20 Nov 2019, from Geylang Market to Dunman Hawker Centre during the heavy down pour to catch the once famous Fried Stuffed Bean Curd. They advertise that they close at 4pm. We got there at 1.00pm and it was closed. Neighbouring hawkers informed us that when biz is quite they just close n leave for home. This is BAD news to their customers. Will NOT bother to visit this place again."
Fresh steamed fish. Very reasonably priced and huge too!
Nice local place and food is cheap
"Good food. Steam fish head Hongkong style. Oyster with egg, sweet sour pork ribs and fried French beans with garlic. Desert:Rojak. Drinks: Chinese tea."

"First visit in years. Rojak only open from 4pm. Tried the wanton noodle, rong ji chicken rice and the soon kueh. All very very good. There are lots more to try next round."
Difficult to get carpark lot in this vicinity.
Best in the world wan ton noodle. Spicy and Q2 Noodle!
I love honey lemon 
"Had great toa Kwa poa.. Although he reduced the number of ingredients like pork ears, n no chopped duck in the toa Kwa, the flavours were still there. They do not stuff the bean curd as before but, not an issue. Chillie sauce still taste good. Fish ball n rest of ingredients like pork maw, intestines, pork belly n fish ball were well cooked and tasted fresh. Double "
Nothing much
"One of the best duck rice stuck at the basement of the food centre.

The kuey chap is soft and broth is just right. The duck meat and peanuts are tender and crunchy! The chili is good!

The queue is quite Long, waited around 20 mins during lunch time."
Nice food. Parking is a problem.
Good place for local good. Walk a bit further for dinner up class good
"Most stalls closes early, head there before lunch if possible. Braised duck/ kway chap stall downstairs is a recommended favourite!"
Nice food . Clean hawker center.
"Simple place with good food prepared by traditional seniors who take pride in their cooking. I love the Malay stall downstairs selling unique sweet potatoes doughnuts, sardine curry puffs and delicious kueh lopez. The wanton mee is great, so is the tau kua pok.
Upstairs congee prepared by old uncle and auntie bring back good memories."
Best wanton mee at Ah Huat.
"Went for the western food.. heard the boss previously a chef in a hotel.. not bad , like the black pepper sauce as I don't like strong black pepper taste.. the aglio olio also is a good try"
Nice place especially the fish head.

Waton mee and steam chicken rice must try
Roast meat store on level 2 is fantastic - highly recommended
"Among the many good food you can find here, I like the dunman duck rice the most.. The braised duck is really delicious! They serve kuay chap here too, with braised egg, pork belly, tau kwa etc.. There are two stalls in this level serving braised duck, but this one stands out"
Great neighborhood hawker centre. Excellent prawn mee and char kway teow!
"Braised duck, wan tan mee, tau kwa pow at basement level very good. Tau water pow is classic. Upper level, Dunman wan tan mee, Heng Heng prawn noodles, Lau Hong Ser royal (the Legend), all very good too. However if you are driving, parking is very limited."

Car parking is a problem during peak period.

"Fresh, delicious and value for money meal here.  Fish only cost $15 here!"
"The best days of this place are far behind. There used to be a lot of good food but most of those stalls have moved out.

There was this good wanton mee stall which has closed. The rojak stall used to be good but it has declined in standard. Most people go there these days for the frog porridge and the 2 zi char stalls. The frog porridge stall is moving out in March so the patrons are going to decrease.

The stall selling carrot cake and fried hokkien mee is overpriced for the quality and quantity of food it is serving. Not recommended unless you do not fancy the other stalls."
Food is cheap and good. What is more to expect?

Have been a loyal customer for the Dunman Wanton Noodle stall for many years. Good portion noodles has its own fragrance with nice texture. 4 wantons is considered big with nice lean char siew and loads of vegetables. Top with the spicy power chilli makes it my best meal of the day! So far the best tasting n value for money wanton noodles that I've tried.
"Dunman wanton noodle on second floor is the best in Singapore so far!  None could beat its spicy chilli, smooth noodle and generous serving of chao siew and wanton!  Cheap is very reasonable too."

Good food here
"1 of the best Rojak, faster Q. Prawn & pork ribs noodle, also great."
"Dunman Food Centre along Koon Seng Road, near Joo Chiat. Quite a unique hawker Centre, small area, double-storey, and with parking lots so few that your finger can count.

Famous for their Wanton noodle and Tao Kua Bau in the morning. For dinner and supper, Frog leh porridge is the anchor stall.

The Dragon City stall selling frog leg porridge also serves fancy lobster soup and porridge, doing a brisk business. Have been eager to check out their frog legs porridge for a couple of years. Finally had the chance today. Their porridge is excellent, cooked in broth and even better than their more famous counterpart at Geylang Lorong 9. However, the gongbao sauce is lacking in kick, and the frog leg texture is not tender throughout. I had two different pots here with the same results. So, Geylang Lor 9 still reigns.

Tried the chicken satay here without any expectation. Surprise surprise... it is very good! Done just right and tender on every stick. I would say even better than many of the famous ones in Kajang and KL City.

Was attracted by the many accolades pasted on the No. 28 Hokkien Prawn Noodle Stall, so ordered a medium one. Eye brows and corner of my lips dipped immediately seeing the the dish served. Absolutely stingy for a medium plate of Hokkien Mee. Just one, two, three miserable prawns counted, even after digging through the whole plate. Topped up with small bits of squids, and the fried lard bits wasn't crispy. C'mon... this is supposed to be quite a recommended stall. The taste itself is quite ok but left much to be desired.

There is this interesting rojak stall with 10-20min queue, helmed by an old couple. They use old school charcoal grill for their youtiao and daogua bao. The rojak didn't look good, but stands out from the rest because they use Super Super thick prawn paste. So thick that it looks like more like chocolate than gongbao sauce! With some attention, you can taste the prawn paste shooting through your palate! First time tasting this Power! prawn paste. The youtiao though, is not crispy as expected. Probably has more to do with the youtiao itself during the frying process ba.

Lastly, packed back bean curd with ginkgo nuts as takeaways. This is the more traditional type, not the silky or trendy agar-agar type. Normal lor.

Overall quite a nice place to have dinner. The place is airy with high ventilated ceiling and lots of hard working fans. Thumbs up!"
Good and cheap place to eat great fish. Visit OK Mei Wei stall.
Cheap and good local food.
Nice Food and reasonable price except limited car park .
Long Cheng Tian Ji
Very good place to get sunday lunch. Food is well price and food is good!
One of the best Wanton Mee in Singapore! The chilli packed a punch so be careful! Cheap and good!
"Nice and cheap steam fish head, corner shop. Have to wait up till 30 minutes minimum for food to be served during peak period."
Good old food place to be
Dark and mediocre foods
"Good places to have nice food, like Chicken Rice,  Pork Porridge,  Rojar,  Prawn Noodles,  Popiah, Wanton Noodles, Fried Kwek Tiao , Frog Porridge, Duck Rice & others more.."
Only down side is it's for the morning and early pm crowd. Love the prawn noodle personally.
"So refreshing to find Hawker food in this area. Much better value, taste and ambiance than the shopping centre food halls. And no GST shock either"
This is a humble and quietly good eating place where there are plenty of good food on offer. Singapore's original and best tau kwa Pau is still going. Dunman Duck Rice serves superb Teochew braised duck. The wantan Mee usually has a long queue and Gina's Vadai is one of the very best I have tried. Don't miss this place.
"Good placw, good food stalls!"
Place is clean and well kept. Reasonably priced good food.
Cheap and authentic. Toilets on hand to wash your hands after as well. Lots of locals....must mean it's good
"A very small hawker market/food court.
It is one of the less expensive food courts with a nice selection. $5 buys you a nice meal"
There are plenty of experienced hawkers in this food centre. The prices are lower than most newer food centres.
I love the Rojak Stall
"Not much there, most of the stalls were closed"
Good mix of food variety
Love my Wonton mee fix there
"one of the best hawker centre, not only in the eastern part of Singapore, but top 5 in Singapore for hawker food. you can find many good food here. enjoy.."
Like the food there  especially the Rojak n frog porridge stalls.   But parking problems.
Great tasting variety of food at affordable prices
No wheelchair facilities for the old people. they have to climb up and down in order to access the food centre.  Appreciate if you can look into this matter.
Good food. Tables are very near to each other. Not spacious.
"A few good stalls namely Oki steamed fresh water fish head, steamed pork, fried vege, etc. Prawn noodle cheap and good and rojak."
Good hokien mee stall
"A good place for char kway tiao,  'ho bao ( beancurd stuffed with duck, cucumber, fishball etc) and springy fishballs. I also visit this place for my frog porridge cravings."
Zhu Chao Yun Tun Mian Xia Mian Xi Can
"Fatina's Family Food Corner opened about 3 months ago...Variety of food to chose from. They serve delicious Mee Rebus, Mee Siam, Mee Soto,Lontong, Nasi Lemak & so on....Business is from Tuesday to Sunday..From 7am to 3pm..."
"Very nostalgic, food is great too."
limited parking lots
Frog porridge is a must try.
Good fish head at $15 and sambal kankong $5.Husband and wife..value for money..open until 10.30p.
Nice food but it's very stuffy
cheap & good food
Availability of item not consistent. One moment is there and next week a new item.
Local hawker centre food not bad some stall open till midnight.

Prawn noodles

A hidden gem. Some of the best local food can be found here.
Nice wanton Mee. Careful of the hot hot chilli....recommended.
Fu Xing Zhu Chao Bu Cuo Hao Chi. 
Nice wanton mee
Great local food
"Good Taste.
Anyone looking for a quick and tasty bite for lunch or dinner can consider this humble hawker stall specialty on Duck.
Very Economical."
Cheap and nice hawker food. Always here for the wanton mee and oyster omelette. There's one wanton mee stall at level 1 and basement each. Each is unique is it's own way and really nice. The chilli is great. The fried oyster omelette still retains its standard. $4 a plate is cheap and alot to eat. Always buy the soya milk or grass jelly drink here to support the old uncle. One big mug only $1.
Very little selection of food and very crowded. Tables are dirty and takes cleaner long time to clean.
"Great place for local food!

The Rong Ji chicken rice stall at Joo Chiat have moved here too!"
"Good for local cheap eats. Don't expect anything fancy though. You will probably not find anywhere cheaper. Just bear in mind that it's a small, self-service local food court. It's a cash only service
We'd always drop by when in the area"
good foods n area
here have a got good food
Flavourful frog Porridge and fish head. Worth the travel to try!
"Great food here. However, you need to be prepared to tolerate the humidity if you want to eat here. I'll suggest getting a seat near the edge of the hawker centre to fight off the humidity. It still packs the crowd who throngs the hawker centre during meal times in search of great tasting food at reasonable prices."
Good local delights managed by old store owners in an old run down place.
Good place for family dining..good price and the food are yummy. Love the fish head
Jing Ji Mei Wei Chuan Tong Duo Yang Di Dao Dou Gan Bao Lu Ya Guo Zhi Yun Tun Mian
5 stars for the wanton mee stall. Uncle's memory also 5 stars.
"Smaller hawker centre. Less stall than before renovation
Has the famous heritage stall selling rojak . Tau kwa bau also found here."
Try the Wanton Mee stall at the lower level
Nice foods
Cheap and nice local food
"Good food options. However, good to be earlier to secure a parking space."
Crowded with food enthusiasts for its fish head at only $13!! Unbeatable price!!
Many good food stalls to choose from.
An old favourite for us. Been our preferred place with the family
"Must have here, frog leg porridge and Rojak. However the Rojak store is seldom open."
Limited parking lots but convenient.
Looking for real wantan noodle? Yes! Here!
Great place with a budget price
The  ok fish head is very yummy n the gravy when go with rice u can finish all even without touching the fish head . And the ( han  zhi ) leaf with chilli is a real must go too all for the price of 22. Cheers keep it up ok store.
Wanton mee feel so salty not worth it and it slow
"Food is nice and affordable, but I find the location a little remote."
Lots of nice food & prices reasonable
"If you are at this place to find good eats, do check out the wonton mee stall as it is pretty cheap and good. But the down side of this place is that it is pretty small for the size of an average hawker centre and it has two levels. Do come in the morning as there would be more variety of food as stalls normally open in the morning and start to close during the late afternoons. It is a little inconvient to come to this place by public transport and the nearest shopping mall to this place is Katong 112."
One of the best place to be in spore.great people sporean culture kind heart humanity at the best.thumbs up.great singapore people smiling angles salute respect.
Hao Duo Mei Shi. 
Tried the Prawn Noodle and BBQ Chicken Wings.. Nice 
Good cheap food.
Limited variety of food available.
Food is average except for the Rojak dish.
nice place
Makan parking no body disturb
Went there for steam black bean fish head for lunch. Quite good
"Compact and old food center, many good food variety at value price. Small car park."
Good local food..very good frog porridge.
"I love 2nd floor stall (opposite the Western) their fish , kangkong, n salted fish mince meat delicious! N cheap!"
"This food centre has a history of over half a century old. Redeveloped to a modern facade, you can now dine comfortably in this 2 storey hawker centre.

You can find the famous Tau Kwa Pau a.k.a. deep fried halved bean curd stuffed with chopped and mixed fillings consisting of braised  duck meat, crispy fried dough, cucumber, ect.  This stall was founded in 1959 and first located in a coffee shop in Katong/Joo Chiat junction.

You can find another famous Hainanese chicken rice and pork / chicken congee stall previously at Joo Chiat Place and later shifted to the corner coffee shop at Still Road/Joo Chiat Place junction. The stall shifted to this food centre in late 2017. They only open between breakfast and after lunch hour.

Other than the above, you can also find braised duck rice, nasi lemak, HK style steam fish, wanton noodles, Chinese Tze Char, soy bean and chin chow drink and stalls selling coffee, tea, soft drinks, beers and stouts.

The downside is the car park is a small one and the hawker centre is not wheelchair friendly."
Great place for cooked meals. Car park rather small.
Good place to eat but parking problem
Wanton Mee and the new braised duck rice and dou gan bao is a die die must try
Seafood variety on level 2.../local food on level and basement and famous stalls for home and authentic taste
Good wantan mee
Only few worthy stalls
Many store not open on monday
"Nice, old hawker centre where most stalls have been around for ages. Sane prices which I understand to be largely due to sane rental rates (unlike the new food courts/fancy hawker centres). Food quality here is good and the style, rustic. For example, the Wanton Mee still comes with fried pork lard! This was ubiquitous in days gone by but sadly, is now much maligned."
Clean but a bit old.Delicious food!
Decent duck rice and wanton mee! At affordable price of $3 ;)
Most stores closed.
Decent food
Yummy yummy wanton mee
Cheap and reliable service
"Minus one star for location. But if you are in the vicinity, you absolutely have to try the wanton mee on the upper level of this hawker centre. The noodles are springy and the Chilli is very spicy."
"Seems no halal food here, place quite ok similar to the other food center"
Cheap and good delicious food and drinks
"A few good stalls like the rojak, wantan and the duck rice stall. Cleanliness is so-so like other hawker center"
Amazing wan tan mee (spicy spicy) and rojak uncle has been there since i was a kid
"Not enough to eat! Wonder the east friends are always so slim. 3 dollars.
I have prawn noodle at 02-12. Heng Heng Prawn Mer Soup.
I swauy swauy Kena small portion.
Taste no bad lah. But hungry still. So Angry give one Star. Hahahaha"
The ah huat wan tan noodle at basement is nice.
"Some great options... Not many, but some great food!"
"Tiger beer bottle 6 dollars, carrot cake 4 dollars. What more you want la macha?"
Cheap and Good Food... But avoid weekends as long queues

There are at least four popular hawker stalls in this food centre
The place is a bit cramp n stink fishy smell on the table. Food ok.
"Quite a number of good food there, e. g. Dunman Wantan Mee..."
Ah huat wan ton noodle must try. Ok zhi char stall on first level must try their steam song fish head.
#02-20 fresh steam fish indeed. Portion big enough for 4 pax.
Wanton mee is nice and the steam fish head is quite popular there
Wanton mee is good
"Daytime is the Kway Chap at the lower level. Evening would be Heng Heng prawn noodle what I rate as the best prawn noodle in sg. The traditional type none of the big prawn fuss. Dry mixture is perfect and the soup base superb. Lau Hong Rojak is the best in sg. How the paste is done is artistry and stick to the ingredients that doesn't turn watery. Also the steam fishhead Song Yu is very good. There's 2 stalls, I'll go for the corner stall where the Chinese couple is. The fried vegetable Di Huang Miao they selected and serve are always young and tender leaves. Beside these, there's also the frog porridge. The Wanton mee; over rated is my personal opinion."
It's ok but nothing fantastic about this food centre
Best rojak
Yummy waton noodles! And this is probably the only place to find $2 laksa
"Always visit #02-20 for the steamfish. $15 for a HK style steamed grouper. It is just nice for 2pax. It is superbly good. Note that there might be a slight waiting time, and parking might be a problem during dinner time. Prepare to park far."
"There are few stalls good food, like Rojak( only serve after 5.30pm), Dunman Kway Chap and Popiah. But most of the stalls rest on Monday. And most of the stalls start their business in the evening."
Lost & Found favourite food - Wanton noodles (chicken feet is good) & Tau Kwa Pow from Joo Chiat
Cheap and good food
Good food at good prices.
Come here for the spiciest wan tan Mee ever 2nd floor
"Not many stores where open when we visited the center, then again it was quite late around 9:30 PM. The stores that were open also had many options sold out, which was testimonial to how tasty their food is. We got two rice noodles for our sons, a prawn mee for me and a seafood laksa for my husband. Food was tasty, very affordable and generous in quantity. One thing I should have avoided, in the dish for my sons, was this fried bits of fish which were really smelly. The lady did ask if we wanted it or not, but something was lost in translation, and we opted for it!! While waiting for food, we got some juices which were again fantastic. We got our order from the last stall on the left and one stall to its right."
"2nd flr is open at night while 1st flr open day time. 2nd flr has the popular wanton mee and several other stalls like claypot porridge, zi char and rojak. 1st flr has teochew porridge which is super good value for money and their curry chicken is excellent."
a lot of stall was close
Nice food court. The prawn noodle owner is rude. Be prepared for it. Prawn noodle 1/5
Zhi Shi Yi Ge Chi De Di Fang
Good wanton noodle and steam fish head
Best late night food.
"The older the stall the better the food, and Dunman Food centre is home to some of the oldest food stalls in the area. My parents who used to live in the areas as kids grew up patronizing their stalls. Dunman food centre has been renovated with many fans and a toilet for convenience. Ventilation is pretty good. However, the best way to cool down on a hot day is with a big glass of sugarcane juice or homemade soybean curd/milk. The frog leg porridge and fried cai tao kwei (fried carrot cake)  are also famous. I personally enjoy the rich hearty prawn and pork rib soup."
"There is a very good wanton noodles on the upper level. They have the same atomic chili as the much famous Eng's. Incidentally, Eng's was at the basement of this place before they moved to Katong. There were some interesting history behind it, give it a try."
Limited parking space. There are variety of food at reasonable prices.
Good for night bites but can get pretty stuffy and noisy
We found the prawn noodle (both soup and dry) to be average. Black carrot cake was good.
Great variety of local street food and cuisine with ample tables save for the lack of parking spaces.
Meh! Duck rice was overly salty even though the queue was long.
Go there for teochew porridge
Zi Char upstairs is nice. Must order steamed fish head.
"Delicious rojak from Lau Hong Ser Rojak stall in my humble opinion as a non-rojak lover; I have officially changed my stance after tasting this rojak! Generous portions with robust flavours and perfectly married textures.

There is also a steamed fish head stall (in the middle of the last row) featuring the freshest Song He fish head cooked various ways at affordable prices.

If you're popping by during the weekends, arrive before 6pm to beat the crowd for both parking spaces and food stall queues."
"Small Hawker center, nice frog porridge stall"
Food court
"I grew up patronising this food center. I still do. I love all the tasty comfort food. Particularly the Corner underated prawn mee stall , the fresh steam fish and vegetable, cha kuay teow. Of course down stair the one and only heritage tau kwa pau so much to offer there. Never sick of it."
Lots of Hawker stalls but the food is so so only
Good and affordable food. Only issue here is finding a parking lot.
Nice place to eat...
Wanton mee is well done. Prawn mee has the traditional taste.
It has some good food stalls but limited parking space.
"Great place to eat wanton noodle, steam fish, duck rice, prawn noodle, and western food... Prices is reasonable."
Famous for Eng Wanton Mee now known as Dunman Wanton Mee
Limited stalls but overall good food. Difficult to find parking.
The Wan Ton Noodle is the food I ate since my School time & there is good stream Fish Head & other.
Food centre with a traditional ambience. All the food seems pretty good but I have only tried the steamed fish head. Will be back to try the other food
Good rojak and prawn noodle. Great place for late night supper.
"This is one of my favourite hawker centres in Singapore, if not the best. In terms of value for money and quality of food it has to rank up there with the best. To be fair we've only tried five or six stalls but the quality has been consistently good whether we're having cockles, oyster omelette, prawn noodles or even western food. But our favourite stall is Fu Xing Mei Shi, traditional Chinese food on the top floor at the back, in the corner. The food wait-time is a bit long, but it is definitely worth it. The steamed fish is soft and delicious, the veg is full of flavour, the steamed pork is expertly done and the salted egg yolk squid is not over done with strong flavour, but balanced and crispy so you can enjoy the seafood texture. Overall a top recommendation and a place we bring people from out of town, we've had no complaints so far."
"Only a few makan stalls. There are two Coffee stalls, the good one close very early."
Waited 40mins for really expensive and small portioned meal. Not recommended. Taste of sauce for Kway chap was so sweet. Below average duck rice. Don't waste your time.
Good food n Varieties. Reasonably priced too.
Awesome food. Only tried the zhar carrot (cake?) and hokkien mee and they're superb.
Cheap and good food avaliable here
"Good prices,  delicious  food"
Very good food options
Not a lot of stalls open in the afternoon.
Good range of old time favourites.
Nhieu mon an ngon
Great wan ton noodles and other food
Good local place to  eat
Historical hawker centre in the Joo Chiat area. Good ambience but parking is a little scarce
Another place for my favourite steamed fish head
Good very good fish head
Variety of affordable food being served
The food is nice n cheep
"One of the best hawker centers in Singapore. The Walton noodles, curry puff and duck rice at the basement are a must try. The rojak at the upper floor is also great."
Nothing great . But the coffee shop nearby serves awesome Taiwan Porridge.
Great wanton noodles
small quiet hawker center with some good stalls but it's seldom crowded

Cosy food center
Limited selection of food and not that tasty.
Nice rojak
"Good food and not expensive.
Nostalgic place."
"Wanton noodle on 2nd flew is popular.  Very hot chilli sauce.
Prawn noodle soup at the corner near the road is good too."
"Small food center, very limited parking lots. But a food gem,  nice wanton noodles"
favourite Rojak and wantan mee but be prepared to wait.
Dunman wanton mee n rojak store r famous
Not.much choices compared to the hay days in nineteen ninties.
Able to find cheap and nice local food!
There are two Wan Tan mee stalls that are good. One is basement. The other is Dunman Wan Tan or Char Siew Mee. The chill at Dunman's is super hot! Beware!
very clean. good wanton mee. limited parking in the area.
Very good & reasonable priced food.
My fav tau kwa pau has shifted here. What more can I say? :)
Local hawker
"One of the best kuey chap in singapore. Also, the hawker centre is one of the cleanest one that I have visited."
Call ahead to reserve
"Yun Tun Mian Zhi Jia. Lou Shang You Ge Gang Shi Yu Tou,Zuo De Hen Bu Cuo. "
well natural ventilated and easy to get there
Good food till late nights
Small food court.
The best hidden gem of a duck rice and kway chup stall at good prices is right here at the basement! Great rojak in the evenings but expect a long wait and wonderful popiah and wanton noodles! Great frog leg porridge too! Dun miss this hawker!
"Some famous stalls, best visited late at night after a flight of something, as there are fewer people then."
good satay and wings. a good place for a quick dinner. affordable
Food variety is ok
"Tui Jie

A lot of good food here
Try the filled tau-pok and duck rice at this nondescript hawker center! Simply mouth-watering!
Impossible to find a parking lot. love the duck rice at the basement. Go early.
I love the dragon city frog porridge.
"Tried western food and popiah, not bad"
"It's out of the way. But it has a good zhi char, frog porridge and wanton mee"
A very local place for dinner.
"Lou Shang Yun Tun Mian,Xia Mian. Huan You Lao Zi Hao Cong Jia Dong Ban Lai Sheng Cheng Ya Fan Dou Gan Bao Ji Jiang Ying Ye. Bai Tian Wan Shang Pin Chang Mei Wei De Hao Qu Chu,Mei Zhong Bu Zu De Shi Ting Che Wei?Tan Wei Hao Ma 01-05  2016/02/16---18 Zheng Shi Ying Ye"
"Great food here, however they don't have the best food as there are better hawkers at other places like Old Airport Road."
More of a night food haunt than a day one. The duck rice on the corner of the lower floor is magical and so is the kueh stall in the row behind it! The hokkien mee on the upper floor (next to the drinks stall on the right) is equally a favourite with locals!
If you are going to duman food centre. Must try food will be Dragoncity Claypot frog is delicious. Operating hrs 5pm - midnight.
Best Wanton noodles at Seng's
Zheng Yu Hao Chi
"Limited lots for cars to park. Had to Park at the side roads. During heavy rain, rain actually spills in from the top. The roof has big gaps in between ( for ventilation I guess) and rain just spill from there.

The only reasons that I would come here would be for the 2 famous wanton mee stalls (at the first n second floor)."
"Grat taste, perfect for spicy lovers."
Love their super spicy chilli paste that goes well with their springy eggy taste noodle.Very popular stall among the regulars.
"Every wanton seems to have 1 spoon of salt! Careful with the salt please, else HPB will come after this store. Although the noodle is similar to Eng's wanton noodle, it lacks the chilli and pork lard..."
"The current operator used to be the Original Eng's Wanton noodle master, Mr Eng's assistant. The current stall is also Eng's original stall in Dunman Food Centre. The standard here has definitely dropped. Noodles taste of ghee & does not absorb the sauce well. Wantons precooked & put aside for too long, resulting in hard skin. Good portion size for $4.50.
Still prefer the original Eng's wanton noodles."
Another alternative from Ah Huat Wan Tan Mee if the queue is too long or never open. Taste is awesome and good!
"This Wanton noodle is very bland, old school style. It must go with their special spicy chilli, otherwise would give it a miss and go for the stall at basement."
"I ordered black sauce w chilli. One of the worst version I ever tasted. Bitter sauce, sambal too intense. It's bland and flat.. maybe that's why I see people having the soup version instead.  Barely ate half of it"
Average only
Absolutely love this wanton mee at Dunman Food Centre! The noodles are springy with just the right bite. Everything is well-balanced and not overly greasy -- definitely one of the best in the East!
"Reached at around 12pm on a weekday afternoon. there were 3 customers queuing.
What I liked:
-Noodles texture
-Chili
-The amount of meat in the wantons is slightly more than others.
-Price is reasonable

What I didn't like:
-Char siew - dry and porky

There wasn't any pork lard bits given on the two plates I ordered. Maybe need to ask for them."
"To relive my Mum's precious food memories of her younger days at Onan Road, we headed to Dunman Food Centre for her favourite Dunman Road Char Siew Wan Ton Mee. The thinly sliced char siew, bite-sized wanton, crispy pork lard and slightly thicker than normal egg noodles was a familiar taste of nostalgia with flavours of old school vibes."
"travelled all the way over and it's closed on a Wed, 12pm :-( even though the hours stated open"
Good nostalgic plate of wanton noodle
"Not those old school wtm, noodle is eggy texture kind. Very Fei Fei WTM style."
Best wan tan mee 
"I'm giving this plate of char siu noodles a 3-star rating.

First off, the appearance of the dish is impressive--the char siu looks red and juicy, the wontons are flavorful with a perfect balance of softness and bite, and the vibrant red chili looks incredibly appetizing. If you're observant, you'll notice that the crispy, fragrant pork lard is only available upon request, and it definitely adds a nice touch.

However, the noodles were a letdown. They weren't well-coated in pork lard, making the soy sauce and pork oil feel like separate components rather than blending together. The char siu, though decent, was sliced a bit too thin for my liking.

Overall, I'd much rather visit Eng's Noodle House for this style of wonton mee, where you can enjoy noodles coated in a generous amount of pork lard oil, plus the added bonus of free-flowing pork lard!"
"Do request for pork lard in case uncle forgets!

Wanton noodles springy, eggy, char siew acceptable. Chilli one was hella spicy, careful.

$4 / $4.50 sizes available"
Good old school taste!
"Good Wanton Mee, chili was spicy and noodles done nicely! Good price as well for the portion size."
"Cheap, legit and the food centre (and washrooms) is dry, airy and clean. 3 people ate; spent $17 with additional wanton"
"Old school wanton noodles, last time taste better

Dumpling was meaty, char siew was lean.
noodles some were al dente some over cooked, can request for less cooked noodles which will go super well with the sauce and chilli

the chilli last time super spicy, now is very tolerable. i missed the super spicy chilli...

pork lard was crispy and yummy very addictive

the chilli was a super miss :( but ok can try this stall

Dunman road food centre is a very humble and small hawker centre, can visit if you're in joo chiat as they have many decent stalls."
"Indeed, taste is subjective. While the Wanton Noodles are satisfactory, I personally would prefer Sambal Chili to be used as the condiment."
"I can't recall if I have eaten this and I am totally wowed by the wanton noodle. Everything on the plate is so well executed - the firm noodle, the old school char siew, the dumpling, the chilli and the fried pork lard. It's definitely worth the calories."
"Best Wanton Mee in Singapore (Because of Chilli & Nice Wanton)
Ate 2 plates. Portion is good but 1st time try and was too happy to find one I really like so order another. I added chilli."
"Old school wantan mee with a long history.
I like that it's the ""white"" kind, plain and not drowned in some dark sauce, however I think the stall's special point is its piquant chilli sauce. I'm not into spicy, so prob. did not get the full effect.

Charsiew is the dry kind, wantans were a little salty. Soup - nothing special. Noodles were the right thickness and texture, the kind that I like. The lard bits were a bit stale though.
Their default is the $4.50 version.

I am a wantan mee fan, still looking for my perfect one (the one at the corner Ting Yean coffee shop was it, but they closed down). Koung's would come close.
There was no queue when I went at 11.30am on a weekday, but by about 12pm a line of 4-5 pax had formed.
Would I eat this again? Prob. only if I happened to be  at the food centre."
Super good!!
"Tried both wantan mee at Dunman and I'm leaning toward this.

Noodles are chewy and coated well with the sauce.

Soup and charsiew is good. And the price is affordable too."
"14/9/24
Had wanton noodles ($4) for lunch, was extremely good. Noodles was cooked al denta & chilli was spicy delicious."
"This is the best wanton mee I've ever had, it's always the same consistency, yummy  everyone has their own taste, but I've tried about every wanton mee in Singapore and this is by far the best and absolutely delicious, great price too!"
Spicy soya based wanton mee. Noodles not eggy yet nice texture.
"Noodles were al dente, nice light sauce and mildly spicy, sour chilli. I have had this white style of wanton mee in Malacca and it is the first time eating this style of wanton mee in Singapore. A must try! Rather affordable as well"
Really cannot comment much except that it is authentic singapore wanton mee.
"Great to be back here again, must order when you are in Dunman Food center"
This stall is very hard to explain bc of the noodle size but the chilli is gd sorry.
"Excellent wanton mee, springy noodles cooked with the right timing. Together with the chilli, reminds me of Eng's wanton mee. It's on the upper floor next to the Mee Chiang Kueh store. Great for breakfast and lunch. Shop closes on Thursdays."
Way better than eng wanton mee . If ur looking for wanton mee in Katong . Will return $4 portion is good enough
One of the better wanton mee in Singapore. Super spicy chilli.
"Only one type of noodle here! shouts unker (in Chinese). Pretty good wanton noodles, there was a longish queue around lunchtime, was there at 1pm and it takes a while (maybe 10-15min) with 5-7 people in front."
Polite staff with great food...
Taste very similar to Eng's. Super spicy chilli.
"Love their Wanton mee!! The noodles are springy, the sauce is amazing the Wanton is very tasty too!

Love it!

Even their chilli is spicy and special!

When I taste the broth it's not those usual msg soup too, can taste the fragrance of the  meat."
"Good, thick noodles with great flavor. Great sauce as well!"
"Noodle may be thick, but the texture is good, al dente. Has a stronger alkaline punch than most typical Singapore style wanton noodle, reminds me a little bit of JB style wanton noodle, which I really enjoy. Better served spicy, as the chilli sauce enhance the overall flavor profile of the dish, giving it more depth. Avoid lunch hour as line can be long. This is not a generic, run of the mill wanton noodle. This one definitely left an impression on me. "
still nearest to the original . Started eating at  Eng's way back in 1970 at everit Road
"Dunman Wanton Mee offers an exquisite culinary experience that left me thoroughly impressed. The texture of the noodles was simply outstanding, striking the perfect balance between firmness and tenderness. Each bite was a delightful journey of flavors, showcasing the expertise and dedication of the chefs. Whether you're a noodle aficionado or simply seeking a memorable dining experience, Dunman Wanton Mee is a must-visit destination."
"One of my favourite Wanton Mees in Singapore. Love the texture of the noodle, the wanton, and the soup...and such an awesome chili sauce as well to make a great combo."
"One of the best Wan tan Mee in Singapore.
Must try their chili"
"Honestly, thick egg noodles weren't initially my preference for wanton mee. I usually avoided noodles of that thickness. The first time I tried it, I wasn't particularly impressed. However, there's something about it that kept drawing me back, and now it's become one of my favorites. I find myself craving it and thinking about having it every now and then. It's seriously addictive. Plus, the bonus is that the chili is really spicy and delicious! And the best part is, the large portion is only $4.50, and it's really huge!"
Glad i decided to try this stall. Definitely prefer this to the one at Geylang (closed now). Will eat again if i manage to find parking!
They have relocated their outlet from Geylang to Block 216 Bedok Food Centre.
"Overall it was good but noodle can cook slliiighhhtyyy longer as some parts were a bit undercooked. Chili was nice, will be great if can serve a bit more. Can try if around the area."
"Very normal wanton mee, not sure why so many buy.... i like the chicken feet"
Taste great and comparable to the few wanton mee around the area. Can be less salty.
"Noodles is al dante (though a tad salty to me), and the chilli sauce, as mentioned in earlier reviews, is spicy!

The wanton is different from the usual ones and is really the standout for me. The cheapest portion at $4 maybe too little for big-eaters."
"Queue here moves fast despite it being long.

Ordered the large portion (SGD4.50) and requested for pork lard. They don't add it by default.

This wanton mee isn't like the usual wanton mee Singapore has that is w black sauce.

Hmm I think it is a decent plate of wanton mee, w the chilli making it special. Without the chilli, it just tasted v normal. The noodles were al-dente but still a littttle bit alkaline-y. I like their soup and wantons.

7/10."
"This wanton mee stall has been around for quite some time and is located within the popular Dunman road hawker center. Went on a weekday late morning and there's no queue. Using a thicker type of noodle, it's cooked to perfection, nice and springy. Char Siew was ok and wanton was nice and tasty. Do take note that their chili is famous for its spiciness, so for those who can't take the heat, please don't be too adventurous on the chili."
"This stall at dunman food center sells very decent wanton noodles and to me its key selling point is the spicy chili - they took over from the original Eng's.  I went today to order noodles and requested for more chili but the lady, who use to work for Eng as his assistant, was very reluctant and annoyed at having to add more chili. I don't quite understand that if it's one of the draw, surely, one needs to showcase it more.  I can understand rising cost is a big concern among the small businesses and if they feel strongly, pls by all means charge for the additional chili.  For the average chili eaters, they would be bothered because they will be satisfied with what's given and it wouldn't affect them.  For those who like it spicy like myself, if I have to pay I would so that I can enjoy my meal.  If the chooses to be stingy with its chili, then I might as well patronize other stalls. Why bother here - pay money and still get a scowl face??"
"A top favourite wanton mee in the hood. It's the 2nd floor shop at Dunman Hawker Centre (not the basement one). To the discerning, it beats the now Eng's franchise. Got to love that the old lady still handmakes the dumplings/wantans by herself. Lovely grandma's food vibes. The chilli is also wicked spicy so be warned. They do have bowls of soup with more wantans at extra cost."
"Nice springy spicy wanton mee at Dunman Food Centre.

Wanton mee usually is on the bland/sweet side due to the char siew sauce, but this one has a fiery zing to it and hence makes it quite popular.

Quantity is also quite good for the price point of only $3.5. Quick service on a weekend, short line of 5 minutes."
Regular customers patiently wait in line for this stall that has been operating for many years.
"What's great about the wanton mee here is that everything is on point. The only minor issue is that the chili is slightly too spicy, but aside from that, the noodles, dumplings, and soup are all excellent. Personally, I found the dumplings to be the standout. The price is now $4 for small, nd $4.50 for big."
Old school taste
my favourite style of wanton mee and I frequent here at least once a week! thick springy flavorful noodles reminds me of my childhood. chilli really packs a punch and you can request for them to add pork lard if you want. The umami of its transparent looking sauce gives each mouthful of eggy noodles such a delightful experience.
Noodles is different from the usual char Siew wanton. Not bad
"Never disappoints and also delighting the tastebud! Nicely cooked qq noodles with wonderful sauce. The sauce is almost transparent but packed a punch.

Always ask for extra pork lard and your wish will be fulfilled. Very nice crunchy crispy flavorful pork lard!

The chili is very spicy so be warned!"
"A hidden gem, Dunman Wanton Mee.

The star of the show is their noodles - springy, perfectly cooked, and carrying that distinct eggy fragrance. Each mouthful is a delight of textures, leaving you utterly satisfied.

The wantons are equally impressive, bursting with succulent fillings that will make your taste buds sing. Handmade by the auntie.

And let's not forget the sauce - the piece de resistance. A blend of soy sauce and lard, it creates an umami explosion that keeps you craving for more. Plus, the chili has a spicy kick that elevates the whole dish (be warned !).

Portions are reasonably priced, in this age of rising inflation.

In summary, if you seek authentic wanton mee with heart and soul, this is the place is a must try !"
Used to be really good and a loyal fan. The food is still good but the change of staff sucks. Grandma attitude is not the best.
very nice wanton. joo chiat is blessed with so many good wanton mee choices and this is equally good as the rest.
"Slow quiet day, handful of customers, no line whatsoever. What I've received on my tray actually looked promising. Colorful, vibrant and a heap of pork lard. Soup was bland. Char siew despite looking like the ordinary food coloring red variety, this was deliciously sweet without being dried out.

Toss everything up with a soupful of soup and this isn't bad at all. Crunchy perfectly cooked noodles, sweet char siew, juicy wanton, perfumed lard bits gelled the mouthful together. Lovely. That's up til the point where the fiery burn from their house special chilli sauce bulldozes everything down. Painfully."
"Famous Dunman wanton mee ..standard still maintain :)
Operation timing changed 8am - 9pm
Every alternate Wed (kopi shop closed) this coming 17 May is open"
"After the Eunos branch moved away, have been craving for a nice plate of Dunman road wanton mee since then. Drove over during lunch on Saturday and ordered two plates of noodles without char siew.
Pro tip: If you like stronger tasting noodles, you could ask for a saltier version and it will bring out the taste and fragrance of both the noodles and wantons.
Also, this is not your usual Hong Kong style wanton noodles, this noodle is thicker."
Not my favourite type of wantan mee so my rating is probably reflective of my personal preference. Wen Kang Ji just down the road at the same coffee shop as Da dong prawn noodles is much much better if your preference is for springy noodles and well made HK style charsiew.
"Apparently this is also related to the Eng's saga but a generation prior. According to Daniel's food diary, It was first known as Eng's Wantan Noodle before the two partners owning the stall split ways. One went to open Eng's Char Siew Wan Ton Mee on a different floor within Dunman Food Centre, while the other kept Dunman Road Char Siew Wan Ton Mee as it is.

I love this noodle texture better and the wanton was awesome. So fortunate that all the good food is in my hood "
"The wanton mee is light and springy.  Run by an ex staff of the Engs wanton noodle store, given that the family run outlet is gone, and the green outlet is not really an option for me."
"Need not say more. I don't stay around here, so if I have the chance to be nearby, I will come. Be it this stall, or the one below. Excellent wanton mee. To others who said it's kind of uncooked, sorry, that's how it is meant to be. It's just excellent, springy egg noodles, non soggy type. Wanton is also another level by itself."
I often could not catch the time as they close abt 4 to 4.30pm. this morning manage to find time and went there. Saw a Vietnamese woman manning the stall. Order the large one and was disappointed that quality has gone down tremendously. The noodles is overcooked and the char Sui is dry. Only constant is the red sauce chilly. Will not patronise for a long time.
"Noodles were a bit ""uncooked"". Felt that the noodles could have more flavour. To be fair, I'm reviewing as a Malaysian tourist so it could be me that is not used to the Singaporean norms."
"You used to be the best wanton mee in SG which I craved so often.
Why did your standard dropped so much. And since when your noodles become yellow noodles with Kee taste. Hao Nan Chi Shi Wang"
"Been here many many times, the taste is excellent! The sauce is spicy and great! The wantons are perfect here too! I like the bite it has"
"My go-to wanton mee place. It is the old school style of wanton mee with their chili sauce packing a really hot punch!

The noodles are perfectly cooked, tasty with no alkaline taste, and they absorb the flavor of the seasoning so well. Decent charsiew, wanton and soup.

If you're looking for wanton mee done al dente with chili that will definitely bring on the heat, this would be worth trying."
"One of my favourite wanton noodles. For lack of better description, this noodles is done in the style of Eng's with plain noodles topped with blazing spicy chilli. They are quite generous with thick pieces of rather lean char siew. Flavourful chilli."
the OG eng's style wanton mee
"Visited on 30 Oct 2022. Ordered 2 of the $3.50 wanton mee and the noodle is tangy, with the sauce complimenting the noodle and char siew nicely "
Bian Yi You Hao Chi
Lovely noodles with their signature vivid orangey hot sauce
My favourite old school wanton noodle . Chilli blended well with the egg noodle . Simple char siew and tasty soup !
My new favourite wanton mee in Singapore! Noodles are really chewy and the sauce is light and delicious. The wanton itself is also really juicy. Came during lunchtime on a weekday and there was no queue!
"Very good wanton mee that made me cery happy. Noodles were springy n chewy, wantons were succulent and meatpacked. 4 dollar portion v decent too !!"
Char Siew Wan Ton Noodle+ Kopi Gao Siew Dai -2/7/2022
"Plain but good wanton mee. The juicy wantons are the highlight. Noodles are pretty chunky, in a good way."
Live the chilli. Dry noodles has a hint of 5 spice. Wonton small but nice filling. Price is great.
"I've tried n taste 1001 Wonton noodles in my life n very little have satisfied me.

Today I was brought to Dunman food ctr to try this Wonton Mee. Granted that it wasn't sweet like many I've tasted. But other than that,  I can't see any reason to say that it is good.

The noodles were alright with an ok texture,  the chilli wasn't tasty (but at least it wasn't sweet), the soup was pretty bland,  the char siew very normal.

Hence,  I can't see the hype here.  I'll give it a 6/10."
Very good Wanton Noodles.  The chilly is spicy hot and noodles very smooth and delicious.  Dumplings taste good too.  The price for small is $3.50 and bigger plate for only $4 from this year 2022
Disappointed that Rojak store was not opened. Wantan noodles does not taste as good as before.
"The place was empty, food was great."
"Good and affordable food. Only thing is the chilli is abit too overpowering for the noodles so take care not to mix too much in, otherwise you'll only feel the chilli in the mouth. "
Not opened... most stalls closed..
Old school taste. Simple looking but taste good. Must have the chilli.
"This has got to be my favourite old school style WTM. To me, WTM is a complex dish where things can go wrong in many dimensions. This store ticks all the boxes and is not to be confused with the other shop at the basement.
1. Sauce. Very tasty and good enough to eat with the noodles without chilli, ketchup or green chillies
2. Noodles. Cooked perfectly, QQ and Al dente. Slightly thicker than egg noodles used in other WTM. The noodles absorb the sauce completely, making each mouthful such a delight.
3. Wanton. Plump and fluffy. The pork is very well seasoned and the wanton filling is generous.
4. Chilli. Very spicy and gives a good kick. This is the old school style without shrimps or ikan bilis.
5. Char siew. Lean type and cooked in sweet red sauce. Not the hk style roast type but nevertheless very edible and not dry at all.
6. Cost. For $3.50, you get 3 plump wantons, veggies, handful of char siew  and soup. You can ask separately for fried pork lard.

All in all, a gem in the East!"
"Boss kept the original SG wanton mee taste since the 70s.
Chilli aside, one must taste the ultimate springy noodles, bouncy traditional floured wantons, salted fish-like soup & non-cardboard textured char siew and base sauce to rate.

With simple old school ingredients on a fishy sauce base - its a whopping 5 stars for this HQ! Definitely king of Joo Chiat WTM! His bro branch @ Eunos still lacks the punch. My goto place for WTM deserving 5 stars.

Now, you can add the killa acid-corrosion-stomach-stirring CHILLI to enjoy. Oh yes, and look for Eugene to overkill with the extra baps (Lard)."
"Q for anout 1 hour and waa lucky to be the last customer as they sold out around 2pm. Ordered $4 add ingredients less noodles. Generous amount of lards. Chilli sauce that kicks a punch (not sure if it's Sriracha chilli or their own recipe). Noodles doesn't have the alkaline taste.

Apologies for the poor taken photo as i took a video and Screenshot instead."
"2 WTM stall at this food center, Dunman Road on top level, Ah Huat at the basement.
Finally had chance got try this higher floor WTM.

Decent plate of WTM, spicy chili sauce, Al Dante noodle. Lacking umami though, probably from the apparent lack of pork lard."
Best Rojak in Singapore
Best wanton mee ever. Love the noodles with the light sauce.
"Went at 10 am on a weekday and there was no queue.  The noodles were pretty good, and the lard oil enhanced the taste. Their chilli is super hot, so make sure you mix it in a little at a time."
"This is probably my favorite wanton mee ever, it is the noodles that make it special, just firm enough & savory that makes you want more. And then there is the bright red chilli sauce, this add another dimension to the noodles, but be careful, it is very spicy! The wanton & char siew play 2nd fiddle."
"Noodles cooked to firm consistency, but far too salty for comfort. The chilli is fiery hot. Dumplings are good while char siew is average. Overall enjoyable plate of noodles except for the saltiness."
"The noodle was cooked with the al Dante texture.  Taste is traditional type without the black soya sauce or ketchup.  Char Siew so so and the chili sauce is real spicy.  If you like such traditional style wanton noodle, can try."
"The char siew is not great (quite bland and lean), but the handmade wantons are good. Chilli is very spicy, consider asking for none or less chilli."
"Malaysian-style wanton mee, I personally think its the best one here. Plus points for the polite and patient stallholders!"
A good and well seasoned wanton noodles. The chili sauce sure packs a real spicy punch. But today's noodles seem overcooked.
Wouldn't rave about it. Average
Nice and hot chilli.....
"Part of my regular circuit, need I say more?"
Standard has dropped. Had lunch at their Eunos branch and was disappointed. Noodle has changed' a lot more yellow kee. Char siew is so so. Chilli is the only thing that saved the day. Soup was OK.
"An alternative to engs - but spicier chilli, better al dente noods and more generous with ingredients $3.50 a plate!"
"Noodle texture is perfect and is thicker than most won ton mee, gravy with an accent of saltiness Don't mix the chili at the get go cos it will overpower the flavors on the plate unless that's the highlight you're looking for"
"Best wanton mee in Singapore for me. I love the spicy chilli sauce, QQ noodle texture and end up with a nice bowl of soup. Frequently visit this shop for more than a decade despite staying far away from it."
Too salty for my liking. Noodles were over cooked. Not springy like what many other people said. Probably mine was one that wasn't done well that day. Disappointed.
"Quite a popular stall at Dunman hawker so decided to go along with the crowd and try it. Turns out to be pretty good - quite similar to Eng's but at a fraction of the cost ($3.50) Chilli was very spicy. Charsiew was good. Just felt that the wanton could be larger and more tasty, but at this price point it's hard to demand a lot more. Would come back to eat this again."
"Good wanton noodles. The Chillis is power! Noodles texture are chewy, good dumplings and soup. Char siew is so so to me. Reasonable price $4 for a plate that size."
old school favour tastes with dark soya in base.
"Still maintain standard, best"
Excellent wanton noodles with tender char siew.
"Compare with others , nice and reasonable price. chewy n spicy chili"
"Bu Cuo,La Jiao Jiang Tai La. "
"Very nice, highly recommended"
"Fish head , steam park"
"Good  plate of wanton noodle with spicy  chilli and taste just right, great taste."
Lots of good old school food
"Very good Wantan Mee  I would say better than alot of those chain stalls around Singapore. The Noodle is really good, thick & springy "
Just the kind of Wanton Mee my family enjoy! Uniquely appetising.. anytime!
It's the sauceless style of wanton mee. Personally not a fan unless there's very tasty/spicy chili sauce. Their chili sauce was nothing to scream about. Wantons and ccar siew were decent.
You Ji Dang Ge You Ge Hao
Char siew a big let down. Nothing fantastic about it.
The mee is particularly good. The wantons and char siew are ok but not so spectacular.
Closed from 4apr to 4 may 2020. according to the notice at shop front.
Best of the best
My all time favourite wanton mee! 
Tbh avg plate of wanton Mee but the CHILLI RLLY CARRIES IT.
"best wanton mee without a doubt. chilli is strong and spicy, noodle has a springy texture and wantons are juicy and tasty. relatively simple bowl of noodle but comes with fantastic taste."
"This is 1 of my favourite stall for wonton noodles. For just $3.50, you get 4 wontons and lots of char siew. A word of caution for those who can't take spicy food. You can request for the chilly to be put on a separate saucer and they gladly oblige you."
soft wanton
Chilli sauce is similar to Eng's - very spicy. Noodle is thicker than others.
"Awesome Wontan Mee. The chilli  is shiok! Service is excellent. Stall is located at Dunman Food centre 2nd floor. Noodles are cooked just nice, tad al dente. You should order a plate of dry wontans to go with the fiery hot chilli. You won't regret it! . They have recently opened a stall at 7 Eunos crescent. Will head over to try it and give a review. See ya !"
"I think the key must be the mee. The mee with the fragrant pork lard is so bouncing and flavorful. I order a big plate for 3.5SGD. The bounce must be the wan ton and chili. Although wan ton is small but it is also very flavorful. The chili ,wow, perfectly spicy. Most Singapore chili is not spicy and too sweet. This one is just perfect. Make whole plate to be upgraded."
Delicious wanton mee with cheap price (3.00 sgd) WARNING for the chilli is quite spicy :3
5 stars for both value and taste. Savoury noodles plus potent chili. Charsiew is not the highlight for sure though!
The noodle is cooked just right with a little chewy. The chilli is spicy but good with the noodle. Die due must try!
Known for the eggy texture of the noodles. Chilli was spicy and enhances the flavour. Not for char siew lovers though as it is there only to complete the norm ingredients of wanton noodles. Soup was hot and flavourful. Short queue at times but moves very quickly.
For food lovers. Taste not bad.
On the salty side
"One of my favourite wanton noodle stalls in this area. The noodles are nicely cooked, with flavourful tasty sauce. If you like it spicy, their chilli sauce is really hot and spicy. This stall has a strong following mostly from regulars. The portion is relatively big and value for money."
The Wanton Mee was the best ever.. The Wanton Mee had very rich flavour and one of a kind Wanton Mee and certainly the best in Singapore.
great chewy noodles and lucious wontons
"Tried this instead of the ah huat wanton mee. There was already a long queue forming. Overall, i think i still prefer ah huat's. This wanton mee was alright but nothing fantastic. Noodle was nicely cooked. Seasoning sauce was a little bland and they serve those ""carboard"" charsiew."
"It's a wanton mee that isn't drowning in sauce. It's a light sesame sauce base. The chilli has a kick to it. Apparently, this was a disciple of Eng's wanton mee. Hence the resemblance. Noodles had some bite but not the springy type. I would have preferred a thicker cut of char siew but this is the style. Char siew itself was rather bland. Wanton was not bad but could be better. I think this stall is still better than the one downstairs."
"very good wanton mee, this one is the salty chinese version (not sweet one)"
The Chili and the Wontons are an amazing one-two flavour punch combination. An addiction I just cannot kick!
One of the best in Singapore....although you will get better ones in Malaysia.
A great local spot for street food with a wide variety of dishes. The atmosphere is especially nice since it's close to the beach.
"One of the best place to din in sg
Lots of bbq
Operation hours usually 4-5pm
Food is nice and location is near the beach"
"The beach and the sea always brings happiness.  After a day of fun and workout, this food centre offers drinks for refreshment and hawker food to fill your tummy."
This place is good for friends parties.
A place to come together with family and frenzs
Always going back to this stall. Their seafood are always fresh !! Go for some refreshing sugarcane juice it's so amazing !
"Nothing beats a table full of local hawker fares in the evening with cups of sugarcane juice or coconut! You can find one of the best oyster omelette, sambal stingray, roasted charsiew noodles, satay, and sooo much more here. You'll be spoilt for choice! Be prepared for a feast and dont forget to bring along tissues."
"There are a few extremely good stalls here. However, fewer and fewer stalls are open for lunch."
"Many bugs and birds, but good spot for food and picnic"
"Food is pretty good. Some quite pricey. Some still okay. The 38 bbq seafood is good, aunty very friendly, good chilli and good taste."
Weirdly a lot of stalls closed
very good flavours and consistency. never disappoints. go during brunch on weekends to avoid crowds and ample.seating
There's always a lot of people eating here... I always order their clams worth $15. So many food choices... will come back again when we go beach
"Plenty of choices with good price!
Must visit!"
Reasonable price and free style.
Very nice 
Yummy duck rice
"Wide choice of different local dishes, something for everyone in the party"
"Typical SG food.
Close to the coast.
19.30 Thursday was quite crowded
Recomended but don.t expect luxury or excessive cleanliness."
This place was very crowded and hot. The seating is outdoor fans but not all of the fans were on. Be prepared for workers from each hawker stall to approach you as you walk around to offer you the menu. Even if you aren't even close to their stall.
Great place to eat authentic Chinese food in Singapore
Used to love this place. Now just people shouting and touting over us while we try to have dinner. This place is cooked
"Food is ok
Self service
Atmosphere is good
U can walk along the coat
Price is cheap"
"Great Vibe , Hard to find seat, Food was So So."
"It's one of the more popular hawker centers in Singapore. We had our meetup with friends here for an early dinner. They knew what to order and the food was great. Lots of choices of local delicacies and grilled food with generous serving sizes. They have a big open-air dining area, but as peak dining hours drew near, the place was full and there were already people waiting for available tables.
East Coast Lagoon Food Village is located by the beach and so after dinner, we strolled along the shore as we continued catching up with our friends."
"Mo Gui Yu,Pi Jiu,Dong Nan Ya Kao Rou,Zhi De Ti Yan"
"Food is fantastic, buy why so many fans are turned off mate? It's a bloody humid country and their fans are turned off."
Ok the food is good but not to my liking and the service sucks like the people are so rude in my experience the atmosphere is kind of nice but it is so hot and humid I was struggling to breathe plus there were so many mosquitoes
Today was public holiday also Monday. Many stall not open for business.
Less crowded in day time.
"Foods are basically good . However , the eating area lack of fans . Feel humid and hot . If can install those outdoor cooler then it will definitely help in our eating experience."
"East Coast Lagoon Food Village in Singapore is a beloved hawker centre renowned for its wide variety of local seafood and grilled delights. Set by the beach, it offers a unique open-air dining experience with a laid-back coastal vibe. Popular dishes include barbecued stingray, satay, sambal squid, and Hokkien mee, all prepared with bold, authentic flavours. The smoky aroma from the charcoal grills fills the air, drawing in locals and tourists alike. Diners often enjoy their meals under the stars, accompanied by a sea breeze. It's a perfect spot for affordable, delicious Singaporean food in a scenic, relaxing setting."
"One of the few good Hawker center  left that you can get lots of variety, especially Saturday and a few famous items like one wonton mee, barbecue chicken wing braised duck and it's very near the beach after the meal you can go for a good walk to digest your food"
Very good food and beautiful view.
Local food at almost  local prices... + Plenty of seating and parking. Had the charcoal fried Hokkien noodles... So far one of the better ones too.
"Food is terrific, but long waiting time."
"Great place to bring visiting friends from overseas to experience singapore hawker stalls. Serves halal local dishes, like hor fun and various other grilled seafood. Worth the travel. Super convenient, a short 15 min walk from siglap mrt"
"Food: Great
Service: Self service
Location: Very far  but worth it"
Local delights
"Solid food at thai restorant, satays not so good"
Good cheap food by the sea. Love this place
Morning not much stall open
Parking is abysmal. Waited for food for an hour. Food came meh. Disappointed.
"Lousy food quality. Had to return the ""food"" and get a refund."
"Nearby the car park, food is not overpriced, variety of sea food, fresh sugar cane juice, fresh tender coconut.

If you like cost effective seafood and beside the beach, it is the perfect place."
"The usual food attraction in the area. Wide selection of food and drinks available. Plenty of satay and seafood stalls, pick your choice!

Advise to go early if on a weekend due to the large crowd. Plenty of seats available but gotta wait for it during peak hours. Same goes for parking too."
A nice place for hawker food
Wide spread of food. Serves satay and chicken wings
"Nothing much here anymore. Food quality going from bad to worse. Stays are 90ct each and half the size it used to be with 10x more char. Not edible. No food stalls here are wow anymore. In the past. Wantanmee and beef kway teow always drew long queues all night, even satay beehoon stalls had it's heyday. Now nobody cares about quality of food here. Expensive and terrible. Especially the geylang lor 29 fried hokkien mee. Yucks."
A big hawker centre but not a great variety as most stalls sell similar items. Design of the seating is asthetic but impractical as carrying tray of food to navigate to the table can be perilous with additional steps and dead end pavilions. Overall food is still nice.
Nice place to grab some grilled meat and seafood.
The Best above Rest !!!
Halal BBQ Chicken wings standard dropped.
"Great for satays, seafood, lovely vibe"
"East Coast Lagoon Food Village is a gem for food lovers. The variety of hawker stalls is incredible--satay, BBQ seafood, and laksa are must-tries! The seaside vibe adds to the charm. It's vibrant, casual, and perfect for a relaxed evening with amazing local flavours with a complimentary sea-breeze."
chicken wings and satay is really good.
Great place to bring visitors. The ocean view is amazing
"Delicious hawker food surrounding a nicely renovated seating area. It was sheltered and had an old school feel to it. It was also facing the ocean, which added to the atmosphere. An old favourite that hasn't disappointed."
Always good food.
Nice to Good experience food are very tasty and sea food also tasty
"A legendary hangout since 1980s. The food centre has undergone many phases of change. It is usually at its maximum capacity on weekends and public holidays.
Some sitting areas are open space. Therefore it is not suitable during rainy season.
Otherwise, the place is quiet during noon of normal days but it gets pretty crowded during evening dinner.
Plenty of choices of local culinary. And its at affordable prices too.
After a heartful meal, take a walk at the park and enjoy the sea breeze. Now it is accessible if you take the brown line to Bayshore station."
A Saturday night Very crowded impossible to get a table at food court and 1 to 2 hours wait for satay or BBQ wings
"This is an open air food center with many seats and tables. There are many food stalls but when I was there many of the stalls were not open. This could be because it was a public holiday in Singapore. Nevertheless, food is delicious and considerably reasonable, given it is a popular place for visitors to East Coast Park.

The only negative point is that not all dining areas have fans, which is a must given our hot weather in Singapore and most visitors only visit East Coast Park during good sunny weather."

"I have been coming here since I was a little girl. The food is still as good as I remember. A few years back, they closed down the food village to revamp the inside."
Very unique Sh style of open space food village with great food selection
"amazing food. especially loved the hokkien mee !
satay and stingrays were good too"
Good and cheap food!
"Fab wings and satay.
Newton vibes.
Seems still going strong..."
A place for delicious foods but few of the stalls are too proud
"Well, I went to this place so many times and I enjoyed some of the food, but sometimes I got food poisoning which I was not satisfied with. Usually I'd go here to eat/drink after or break from fishing at the Bedok jetty/ canal lookout place"
Good place to chill and have a local dish
Good choice of local food but need to bear the heat under this extreme hot and dry weather 
Food is great but slightly expensive but overall it's good
"Excellent place for dinner with friends, self service, close too beach, ample parking, must go place in the south east of Singapore "
Famous oyster egg is our favorite. The lady staff is so friendly and polite. And the oysters are fresh!!
Best breakfast place in all of ECP
Love to come here for bak kut teh and pig trotters. The Malay satay is very good also.
"Probably my favourite hawker centre in Singapore. Great variety of food. Slightly cheaper than satay street and great seating.
The carrot cake was amazing highly recommend trying it"
"Lovely place to hangout and eat a wide selection of local favorites. Do take note that the eatery would close occasionally to do a scheduled clean up, so do check in from time to time before you make your journey here.

Special shoutout to Stall 43 for their incredible Chili Crab and Golden Mantou. Crab was huge and very fresh, sauce was flavorful and not too sweet. Consistency was just perfect to dip the mantou in."
"its a total disaster. so dirty and disorganised. the layout of the foodcourt is horrendous.  i cannot believe such a placd exist in Singapore. on top of that prices are not cheap at all.

rubbish everywhere, tables not clean. dirty floors. stalls look so messy.

the only nice thing is its near the beach and carpark is adjacent... but completely not worth it."
Nice hawker with sea viewing and lots  of food stalls . Best place for families or to picnic. There are many activities too !
Nice food but a bit expensive
Quite overpriced for rojak
"Food expensive. Chicken wings burnt, no mussels mostly shells, eggs amd sauce, satay also doesnt taste good. Honestly, Yishun Park Hawker centre has nicer seafood. The photos doesnt do it justice. It was worst than photos."
"Lovely experience here!
'Haron Satay  & Chicken Wing Stall 55'
- excellent service
- delicious satay chicken skewers grilled fresh in front of you and try it with a nice rice cake

All up 10 skewers for $10 and $0.50 for the rice cake.

'Siam Thai Kitchen'
- ridiculously good flavours. Super authentic and we loved the service. Thanks to the young polite young man taking our order.
- mango salad is WOW and very fresh - we had to repeat. A bit of a kick to it.
- pineapple Fried Rice was also excellent that we also repeated it 

Highly recommend these two stalls.

Went around 4 30pm on a Sunday and it wasn't super crowded - there were a lottttttt of people at the beach though who in an hr or so were likely heading to those stalls next so I think we just missed the rush.

Lots of halal options and note that at the Thai place they use chicken floss, not pork floss "
Very crowded but worth the wait. Lots to choose
Open air hawker food and beer. What more can you ask for?
"THE best Singaporean experience you can have. Forget all those fancy restaurants, this place has it all, including the most genuine local smiles you could ever see! Say hello to bar 245 for the tiger beers from us!"
Seafood getting expensive and taste nowadays not so great like last time.
I love to eat near the seaside. My favourite hawker centre.A wide choice of food. Not overly expensive.
Huan Jing Qing You
"Lots of food option, near sea side restaurants, good places"
What's not to like...great food by the sea.
Best Hawker!!
"If you're planning to visit East Coast Lagoon, consider avoiding weekend nights. The crowds can be overwhelming, making it challenging to find seating and ordering from stalls. For a more enjoyable experience, try visiting during off-peak hours or weekdays!"
Sugar cane drinks is $2.5 for small cup. A bit over price. A lot of tourists visit this hawker center. The place is well kept and clean.
The atmosphere is absolutely amazing!
"Google the stall before ordering people. There for tourists more .. local will not like the food there. Most hawkers centre far
better.."
"Been coming to this food court since I was a teenager decades ago and still love it! Perfect eating place within East Coast Park (Area E), just beside the big car park. Plenty of good food options here like satay and wanton mee. Sugar cane juice is perfect for our warm climate. Nice toilet here. Outdoor but sheltered."
"Great hawker center in a more open, serene part of the city, connected to a beautiful coastal walkway. Definitely worth exploring."
"Hawker centre environment.
Food : good variety
Service: self-service and hawker were friendly.
Atmosphere: clean"
"Got salted egg squid, some veges, Tom yum soup and sambal stingray. Enough for the 4 of us for a late dinner - we went there at about 9pm."
Busy but lots of fun
Lowkey good food
The best bbq sting ray in Singapore 
The best satay I've had during my trip here!! Highly recommend the satay stall that grills right in front of you. Shrimp was fresh and the chicken/beef/mutton were cooked perfectly. We also ordered the sambal stingray - it was alright.
"Must try the sambal stingray here as everyone says, it is well worth it

The sugar cane juice was very fresh as well, highly recommend"
"I ordered a plate of mee goreng at this Mama shop.Upon receiving the hot mee goreng,I started to tuck in as I was hungry after a swim at the beach.I have a habit of eating slow and looking at my food.Suddenly I saw wide open stapler in my mee goreng Immediately I went to ask thinking of the consequences if I or any one or children if have swallow what would have happen???I ask the the Indian fellows but no reply was given and not even apologise.i asked for a refund but he returned me $2.Its not about the money,if I have swallowed what would have happen????Such a irresponsible Hawker.pls take care if order from this stall."
Clean and variety of foods.. can say Singapore is one of the food paradise in SEA.
"The wait for the food was a bit long, but I really liked the first two Chinese dishes. They were so delicious, especially with the restaurant's sauce! Yummy "
"The wait for the food was a bit long, but I really liked the first two Chinese dishes. They were so delicious, especially with the restaurant's sauce! Yummy "
"Bad very bad. Dunno if it's because of CNY, but the food service is pretty slow, not like the food is good. Very bad experience.  Tired like hell already after walking/cycling, but have to endure the hours of wait for food at this place. Never going back there again. Food also not cheap."
Great place to eat with friends and family
"Good food, many choice
Many kind of beer"
"Food is always great. I always order from Forever Stingray (store 43), their calamari is shiok! And so is their sambal stingray and everything else."
A bit pushy the stall owners
"There's one old man to the back-right of the food court selling Thai food that is so nice, good price and makes banger Pineapple fried rice. Try the Green Sambal as well, it's real good.

On the other hand, a lot of the pushy restaurants will overcharge you, especially if they just tell you the food. Try to take a look at the menu for written prices, and even then be careful if they hand you the tourist price menu, and don't feel rushed!!"
"Awesome food centre in the East Coast park vicinity. You can come here for dinner after a day out at East Coast Park. There is a mix of halal and non-halal offerings, with a particular focus on seafood, chicken wings, and satay.

However, I wouldn't recommend the dessert stall selling ice kacang and chendol. They were too sweet, and used ingredients that made the dessert not authentic, such as adding cream to the durian mousse.

Finally, there is much room for improvement for the cleanliness of the place. There were food leftovers all over the floor."
Fast & efficient
"We came during a rainy Saturday evening. Average crowd, so I'm sure it will be packed otherwise. Place was a bit dirty, but i blame patrons for not cleaning up after themselves and not the cleaning crew."
"We went here on the recommendation of some local Singaporeans. It was fantastic. Down by the beach so there was a bit of a breeze and the seats are all under cover - whether that's tarp or building material. The food is incredible! We had the chilli crab, sambal sting ray, satay skewers and more. Everything is very affordable as well and the people very friendly and helpful. It rained a bit when we were there and we didn't get wet at all so don't let the weather turn you off from going. Lots of local people here - there didn't seem to be many tourists at all."
"Super attitude the staffs refuse the hear whatever I request Nann and the counter. How many times I need to get this kind of attitude
East Coast lagoon laksa"
Hate to come here.So many touting.
I love the tasty beef soup noodle at 01-33!
"The worst stall is stall 12, dishonest, paid $9 but receipt is $6, maybe evade tax or cheat boss money. And food is horrible"
Best mutton soup
Great range of affordable local delights!
yummy and good vibes
i went there during at evening and i ordered satau
"East Coast Lagoon Food Village in Singapore is a must-visit for food lovers! Located by the beach, the open-air setting offers a breezy, relaxed atmosphere perfect for enjoying delicious local cuisine. The variety of food stalls is impressive, serving favorites like satay, BBQ stingray, laksa, and grilled prawns. The flavors are authentic, portions generous, and prices reasonable. The seating area is spacious, clean, and well-maintained. Pair your meal with a refreshing coconut drink for the ultimate experience. With its vibrant vibe and excellent food, this hawker center is a gem for locals and tourists alike. Highly recommended for a foodie adventure!"
"Local hawker fare at an atmospheric location along East Coast Park. Has some good snacks such as satay, chicken wings and Hokkien mee available other than seafood. A little overpriced but quite good considering the location"
"After so many years, this is still a nice place to come whether you are a tourist or local.
Satays, Hokkien Mee, Char Kway Tiao, Carrot cake and flush it down with sugar cane drink.
The ultimate Singapore hawker experience"
Great place to have local food with family and friends.  You can find most local dishes here as good as those found in high-end food chains. Located next to the beautiful white beach with plenty of things around for activities.
Food always yummy! My favourite place for calories laden food! 
Here for satay !
Seafood was fresh but lower quality. Nice setting by the water. I would not make a separate trip out here.
"Satay, Satay, Satay. Und das an einem schonen Ort direkt an der East Coast."
Great place to have hawker food at East Coast in Singapore. Favourite with locals and tourists. Must try.
"Nice place to relax and eat satay
Unfortunately, most stalls are closed after 11pm"
We went twice to same store for old style flavor satay.
Always busy everyday food centre where local eats. Just ignore the ushers if you know what to eat. Recommended 
For those of you not so familiar with food options while going for an afternoon hangout (biking/strolling/camping) this place is a good option especially for those tourist who happen to be visiting. The array of local food options are quite good and you might even find something unique (beehoon in satay sauce ). Prices reasonable for this location. If you're in the area definitely a must try.
"STORE 43 STORE 43
The best sour sweet pork ever eat"
"Nothing special, but close to the beach and lagoon."
"Had a variety of seafood, and local cuisine."
RATING 1 BECAUSE THE TOILETS WERE ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. SHOCKED AND DISAPPOINTED IN THE CLEANLINESS OF PUBLIC TOILETS IN SINGAPORE GENERALLY. ALSO SORRY BUT WHAT IS UP WITH NO BIDETS/WATER JETS? SHOCKING DEVELOPMENT. ONE THING NOT TO COPY THE WEST IN...
"Fave hawker center in Singapore.  Always back here for the satay, chicken wings, satay bee hood,braised pork knuckles,wanton noodles, fried oyster, bbq sting ray, beef soup n so much more! Besides the beach to go for walk after a great meal."
Place to chill! Stingray grilled with sambal was greattt! Beers nice having there with heaps of barbeque chicken wings!!!!!! Cockles also fresh! Price not so overwhelming! Worth it!
Hainan satay. Is good 
Excellent & delicious!
"The Bah Kut Teh here is nothing to write home about. However, that braised pork leg is in a different league! One of the best I've had in Singapore. You can request for a more lean or fatty piece of trotter."
"Place for a great Satai, seafood and every noddle on the planet."
Near  to beach
Good atmosphere and ambience
"Take your time to survey around first, some shops are a hit or miss. It's nice atmosphere to dine here but it's more oriented towards tourists. What bugs me is that most stalls will haggle you to order from their stalls (these stalls usually have average food); so don't rush, be firm and say no.  There are plenty of halal certified stalls for Muslim tourists."
"One of the best places to grab a seafood dinner. You need to try the grilled sambal stingray, chill crab lala with fried buns, sambal kamp kong (veggie side). Beer is fairly cheap here too, you can get a pint of Heineken for 6.5, or a Tiger big bottle for 6"
Chilli Crab & BBQ Stingray
Awesome place. I was spoilt for choice and couldn't make up my mind! Only issue is it's alittle hot sometimes .
Local food must to eat
"Ordered prawn vermicelli from stall 26 Cheatbits SG

the prawns were huge and fresh, sweet and firm while the vermicelli soak up all the goodness and the flavours came together perfectly. Highly Recommended!"
 Bests place nearby Seaside.
"That is somemore to improve!
1. Cleanliness
2. Food quality
3. Food taste
4. Food portion not reasonable ( it like getting lesser and lesser not what you paid for )
4. Transport. Only have one bus number to reach there( for those doesn't have a car to go there not easy)!!! This need to improve more."
Good food near seaside and very reasonable price
They need to fix a way to blow the exhaust air from the stalls safely so that it doesn't suffocate the diners.
"East Coast Lagoon is an open food centre with limited shelter, and whenever it rains, businesses there are badly affected.  Recently, it's been raining often, and our brothers and sisters running these stalls need all the support they can get.

I brought my family here today to enjoy lunch at our usual two favorite stalls. Sharing photos of the amazing food we ordered to encourage everyone to find time to visit and show support during this rainy season. 

Let's do our part to keep their spirits up! Jin Ho Jiak as always. "
Had eaten Stall No. 59 ! Lovely & friendly people. It was raining but they managed to got us a place outside beneath the big umbrella. Later on we got a quick change to the pondok when it was empty ! Thank you for the vibrant & welcoming gesture.
"We reach here at 6pm, this place located next to the beach, feeling ""Penang's gurney plaza""
Surprisingly the food options are quite a lot, and some of the seller is very ""aggressive"" to get more sales. Choose wisely, I feel the hokkien mee so so. Bbq fried chicken is good!
Char kuey teow still okay. Air tenure sedap.
Ikan bakar not bad.
Recommend this place or not? Yes, at least come see, actually the cycling path connect to mbs/merlion park that area, if you would like to cycling at this area."
Average food similar to others food court.
"Great location right by the water. The food was excellent, but we went on a Monday so many of the vendors were closed. Chili crab was great."
Can get crowded during meal times
Nice Place
Family friendly beach side food center
Great food and your typical outdoor eating experience. Wide variety.
Great choices.
"East Coast Lagoon have many great food but the design of the food centre is not friendly for handicapped and senior citizen cause there are so many steps. Aside all the sitting are badly designed. Why can't be simple like all other food court. Wonder who's the smart ass designed the food court.

Lastly if all stalls use reusable plates, cups & cutlery the food tastes even better. By using Styrofoam plates it's harmful for the environment."
"If you want another alternative to Newton Circle, this will be the place."
Good location near the coast for a relaxing meal. May be a little inconvenient and if it rains.
Fried charcoal hokain mee and Harum satay is nice.
Good food. Some pricey. Otherwise good.
"All the food is very tasty, yummy and nice. Highly recommended to all.."
One of my dinner place
Nov'24. Just another hawker center with some very good food to explore
"Tried a couple of dishes as part of a foodie tour and cannot complain about the food quality. Each dish had a unique flavour. It is a bit out of the city centre, but worth putting this foodie place on your wishlist. My favourite was chicken satay skewers with peanut sauce as well as prawn noodles."
Nice for seafood lovers at ECP
"This beach side hawker centre is spacious with a great atmosphere and lots of nice food stalls.

I had Thai food at Sangtawan Sunny Thai and it was delicious and authentic."
Rather warm but food is reasonable
Good gawker food selection. Porridge stall offers excellent chicken salad
"Came to Cheat Bits grand opening after hearing that they will open a physical stall. Their Crab tang Hoon was flavourful and prawns were big and fresh. Also had the cheese prawn bee Hoon. Totally loved it. They used to do an online Crab in a Bag style good delivery. Now that they have a stall, I will be back to try it next time. Seafood overload! Look for them at Stall 26!"
Big Prawn Vermicelli from cheatsbits. The food is delicious and the prawn is big and fresh. Highly recommend.
"This food court in the middle of the East Coast park is worth visiting, but beware of tourist-oriented food stalls. If they are loudly inviting you putting menu cards in your hands - you can be sure it is a tourist rip-off where you would pay x3 price.

But there are decent foos stalls there where you can have a good meal for a regular price."
"Crowded at times, a variety of food choices (There's a number of satay sellers) It's quite stuffy seating near the Satay sellers. Overall there are still seats not stuffy but better. Carpark near it is very crowded during holidays"
Leisure and lovely me time
"Locals treasure ! Great food , and atmosphere , although some seafood maybe overpriced .
Can walk along the seaside after dinner."
The one in terminal Jewl sucks!  Overpriced and overcooked...I would rather take Prima instant Lasa noodle.
All food nice and place super duper clean thumb upp 
"i have been coming here since my childhood and the food here never fails to disappoint. the satay beef and chicken are always a must have as it is the main star here as well as the sambal stingray, oyster omelette, sambal sotong and many more but do take note that prices are abit higher up here as due to its location and also try to come earlier(like 5pm ish) as this places starts to get crowded at around 6pm, especially during weekends"
Beer is expensive. Seafood are fresh.
Always delightful foods and delicious too
Mou Xie Shi Wu Bu Ru Yi Qian
"More local than other hawker centres, lots of choices. It does get very warm here"
Awesome place for dinner and supper. Be sure to reach early as it can be really crowded and a challenge to get a table.
"Have not been there for more than 5 years. Food still Good. Evening Crowds is packed. Seafood Stall no. 43(Stingray) BBQ Seafood is Awesome!!!
Still the same Great Taste "
"Bang Wan Qu Bi Jiao Hao,Tai Re Liao,Bu Guo Zhong Jian You Ji Jian Mu Ting Zi Huan You Feng Shan"
Di Dian You Yue De Xiao Fan Zhong Xin Qie Yi De Chui Zhao Hai Feng Chi Fan
Beef noodles.   Fantastic.  Reasonable n top notch
"It's good place to get some food after cycling along east coast area. Some times visiting this place, it's always crowded."
"Came on a weekday afternoon and food options were extremely limited. Wound up ordering satay from an old man that had his grill set up next to the kambing soup / Malay food stall and regretted it very shortly after. I get that hawker centres aren't going to be very clean but this man's lack of hygiene was on a different level! He was marinating the satays with his BARE HANDS, used the SAME hands to collect my cash payment, and then touched the raw onion and cucumber accompaniments with the SAME DIRTY HANDS!!! Needless to say, my appetite was completely ruined thereafter."
"Overall food is okay but the staff sucks, hard sell and keep pushing, really annoying. At the end we ordered several dishes including a dish of shrimps, SGD48 for four shrimps only per picture, but only three served! And they even didn't provide a proper receipt! Ordered satay from other house just okay and grilled chicken below average but oyster omelette and rojak nice. But overall won't come back again, totally different from when I came last time."
Good place to eat
"Very very crowded place esp during meal tines n wkend
Huge variety of local food.
Car park and waiting for tables must be patient.
Next is the queue for food cos popular stalls waiting tine is easily 30 mins."
Chicken storage - nothing else to add
It has been some time since I've been to the foodcentre. Lots of nice food and the outdoor environment is cool and breezy. Try the duck rice and porridge. I highly recommend this and it always has a long queue.
"Excellent satay, great tasting, business appears to have slowed"
"I ordered their  Fried Cockles Kway Teow last night vua grabfood delivery for a friend as she was hungry,hours after consuming the food,she started vomiting and her stomach felt pain and she has  food poisoning due to what she ate"
My favourite place for satay
"Di Fang Huan Bu Cuo. Que Dian Jiu Shi Cang Ying Tai Duo Liao,Zhe Dian Ru Guo Neng Jie Jue,Jiang Shi Yi Ge Fei Chang Hao De Di Fang. Chi Fan You Bu Shao Bu Cuo De Xuan Ze Dan Shi Sha Die Chuan Zheng Ti Lai Shuo Yi Ban Ban. "
Overpriced horrible food that would cause diarrhea.
"Love the ah hui chicken wings and Hwa kee bbq noodles, they serve the best prawn dumplings soup..."
Mutton satay was nice. And they have noticed halal and non-halal items separately.
Satay rly good
Good food and atmosphere!
"Large hawker centre on the east coast beach. Plenty choices, always open till night.
Saturday night you need to wait a bit for a table, since it's very crowded.
A lot of sea food plus the typical Singaporean Chinese, Malay and Indian dishes.
Fun for families."
One of the best areas to make a pause while cycling on East Coast Park
You really can't go wrong with this place. A hawker stall food court on the beach in Singapore.  Get the chili crab or black pepper crab from any of the stalls and you won't be disappointed for $52 SGD. Get two 750ml Tiger beers in a bucket of ice for $17 SGD at Beer 245 stall to watch the ships come into port or watch the happy families sing karaoke on the beach. Very cool place and a must visit if you like local food.
Singapore Good Food
Always looking forward visiting east coast and eat here
"East Coast Lagoon Food Village is a great spot for tasty local food by the beach. I had the Fried Oyster, BBQ Chicken Wings, and Stingray - all were delicious! The seafood was fresh, and the flavors were rich and satisfying. A must-visit for a satisfying meal outdoors!"
"Had some decent food although there was a wait from 7.30pm. the cleaners didn't listen to me when I asked for help to clear the table. Basically ignored me, continued to laugh and talk to themselves and pointed in the distance for me to follow... Follow what!?
So disappointed in the mannerism there, I would have clean it myself (which I did) I just needed tissue/cloth etc."
Chicky satay from Malay store is the best I eaten. Extremely tender and flavour is nice
Nhieu mon an ngon
"Nice place to have hawker food by the beach. Would recommend haron satay, fried oyster, beef noodle and wanton noodle."
Great selection of local food available. It's very close to the beach. Prices are reasonable.
Prepare for a humid seating if there is no wind. Certain seating area can be vy smokey due to the satay / bbq  shops.
Very busy food court but lots of choice
Duck porridge is sooo good
Best place in Singapore to find all kinds of delicious and mouthwatering local food! Must go! Must eat! 
"We visited the area around 1 pm, and wanted to have lunch at the Lagoon Village. Being a Tuesday afternoon, most of the shops were closed. A bit disappointed, cause we enjoyed the fried oysters and carrots cakes there. But we found a Bak Kut Teh store, the lean meat pig trotters were superb! We also like the Mee Sua, tasty and peppery! Good!"
Extremely crowded on the weekends  but food is amazing
Beside the sea. Have sheltered seats. Best satays BBQ chic prawns. Chinese Malay Indian food available. Most crowded on Friday evenings and Saturdays. Open carparks.
Our regular sate hunt
Rat Mat canh dep Rat ok de da ngoai nuong ngoai troi cuoi tuan
Sibei nice eh the food for really reasonable pricing too. Came here to eat and would like to visit here again.
Braised duck is the best!
"This place would forever be a favorite haunt for chilling out with friends or just on a personal sojourn, plus there are several food stalls worth journeying here. My personal recommendation is Cheok Kee braised duck only one stall left in Singapore after having culled from Lim Tua Tow market in the 1960s; Ah Si Hainanese congee with white chicken, Song Kee fried oyster omelette orh luak, successor to lao ma zhi char with the kiam chye duck, prawn cake etc. Open till late."
"Good hawker centre near the airport. Plenty of stalls to choose from. Beers are also available from a couple of vendors. Be sure to take cash or have a local bank account to use PayNow, because they don't have credit card facilities here, except for the bars. Though the bars will allow you to make a cash advance if you need. In my starvation, I ordered a prawn har mee and seafood nasi goreng, washed down with a large Tiger beer. Fat and hydrated for under $24SGD. Can't really complain about that."
Food standard has dropped n became very normal there.
"Beside the east coast bike trails this food village has a decent selection of food stalls. We arrived while most were just opening for the day, so what we had to choose from was a bit low, however we found a Thai food stall and got two pad Thais which hit the spot. It was clean, and staff were quick to clean just cleared tables."
"EastCoastLagoonHawker1220ECP (East Coast Lagoon Food Village), 1220 ECP, Singapore 468960
* 11Aug2024 Sunday recommended beef soup & duck rice; duck & beef don't seem to match; but try it; they match coz both red meats
@nic"
Stall 14 - BBQ chicken.. super nice. Must try  !
"Love the wind blows, but the food here is just normal. Highlight is the duck rice during lunch time."
"They don't provide napkins. Make sure to bring your own napkins. They were pretty quick at turning tables, but not quite cleaned."
By the beach. Always crowded. Food is great. Nice place to get together
Always a lovely place to gather when visiting East Coast Park. Brought an overseas colleague there for dinner and it's always a joy to order a feast of all the different food there! Love the Geylang charcoal Hokkien mee!
"You should bring yourselves or your tourist friends here to eat local foods than any other hawkers! The quality, variety and price of the food, the atmosphere and its next to the seaside with sea breeze is totally worth it. Below are some of the stalls you must order from:

Haron Satay 55
#01-55 - chicken and mutton satay. The meat is so thick and juicy!

Song Kee Fried Oyster - the oyster and big and fresh!

Lagoon Famous Carrot Cake
#01-40 - crispy and yummy!"
Exceptional place to enjoy food and drink with a wonderful sea view. The best time starts 5pm. Otherwise it is hard to find a table.
A famous hawker center in East Coast park. Its very near to the beach. I like spend the evening at the beach followed by a visit to this hawker center for some tasty local seafood cuisine.
"Really awesome food here, decently priced and near the coast. Highly recommended. Though, come slightly earlier to get seats before intended dining time, its packed!"
"Absolutely love the BBQ chicken wings, delicious and tasty."
"Impressed with this plate of fried oyster. Oyster size is also bigger than most stores in Singapore. Had this a couple of times, and decided to review it today. Must try!"
"Now day (29/07/2024)the table dirty without any cleaning service..
The Cleaner seating one site without do anything..
Hopefully got implemented next time"
"Hawker center close to the beach.
Rather limited in food choices, since most stores serve the same food. But what the serve was really good.
Try the sugar cane juice!"
"It's very hot here
But a lot of food choices"
"I went here for the school beach clean-up event. The beach was surprisingly very clean, the wind was refreshingly cool, and the East Coast Park was incredibly vast..."
Hawker centre that has lot of choices and a nice place to hangout till late on weekends
"My fav braised duck stall in the East. Had patronised them for than 20+yrs, come on a weekday to avoid long queue.

Meat is tender and juicy with thick sauce, the chilli sauce is sourish n not so spicy that goes well with the duck.
Add the taupok, tau gua n egg for additional protein, they are great too!

For takeaway, call them at 6445 4222 in advance to place your order, so u can come & collect to skip the queue."
The kind buzzing and hustling place I like as a local. We got a nice seating area with a big S fan providing the breeze when we were feasting.
Bi Xu Da Kai De Yin Shi Tian Tang!
"Feels like back in the past with the retro feel and the food
Prices are ok compared to what's nearby"
As always good place to have food and relax
"Reached at 12pm on weekend, most stores are closed. Don't bother going down at 10am nothing to eat."
"Where locals eat! No frills, just good food.
Many stalls to choose from; you can compare Malay satay with Chinese satay, get chinese style chicken wings, squid, shrimp, skate... all delicious and on a paper plate and plastic tray :)
I was unsure how many stars to give  ""Service,"" mainly because it's not really expected to be any; you carry your own tray.  But some of the stalls will deliver your dishes to your table (the tables are numbered -- note your table number) if it takes a while to prepare. Also if the people before you did not clear their table when they were done, there isn't enough staff to clean them quickly.
Bring your own napkins, but there is a hand-washing sink for after.
Right on the ocean, you can go for a nice walk along the coast after your meal!"
"Always alot of food to look forward to! From chicken wings to satay to fresh seafood like crab & gonggong, theres options for everyone!"
A nice place to relax and have a good dinner with your love ones.
"Good food, no service. Hard to find a table."
Food and place is good just is difficult to find the sitting place.
"Not much of a touting seen in this food village, which makes the customers choose their choices of food without any hassle"
Looks great and lively but was too crowded. Satay was awesome.
Very crowded... especially during weekends...must wait quite a while before securing seats because of weekend crowds..
Good food but dirty place. Most people do not clear their own plates. Prices are a rip off too especially those seafood stores
"Was there at about 11am. Most of the stalls are closed. Less than 10 stalls are open.
The floor signages at the main entrance (from the carpark) are in really bad shape. Should not be left unattended. Am giving a ""3"" due to unkempt signages - one was damaged & the other coated with a thick layer of dirt. Not sure how long they are in this condition.
Was there on 3 July 2024."
"Very hard to find seat during dinner time to crowded..need more place to seat..food are nice

Update 3/7/24 newly open mutton soup by iqbal. The soup thickness really fantastic nice and fragrant. $15 one big bowl i think its reasonable.  For mutton soup lover give a try u all definitly like it."

"The food village is located inside East Coast Park. The closest MRT is Siglap on the TEL. It hosts a variety of stalls, with many selling barbequed items.

Some dishes available in the food village include satay (grilled skewered meats), barbequed chicken wings, and barbequed stingray fish (topped with sambal). Other dishes available in the food village also include Hokkien mee, oyster omelette, amongst many others.  You can also get some sugar cane juice with lemon to cool you down after eating all the barbeque dishes."
Good food and great prices
The braised duck rice is a must have every time I am there.

Went on a weekday soo not much shop open and also if open very limited food there. Soo note to self try not to go in the weekdays.
Want to eat satay? Go to stall no. 59 for the delicious satay. They are called Bobo Satay now. Gravy is also delicious. Tried other stalls but can never fight my awesome stall 59. Thumbs up 
Nice foods for decades
"15 June 2024.
Had family dinner here. Ordered some dishes to share. Many's choices at this Food ctr. Nice place for family or family gathering."
It is always a nice place to chill out for dinner or supper.. The pricing of the food was ok. The most important thing is nice to eat. Every visit  there will bring me to eat the stingrays and sambal sotong.  Great place for beer too.
All kinds of local dishes can be found here and don't expect it to be cheap like any regular hawker food.
Had a fresh bbq stingray and satay at 'Musa' stall but can't remember the stall no. Must try guys...
"honestly really fun and bustling, fun place to talk and drink"
Nice vibey outdoor hawker center right by the beach. Been going here most of my life and the food has always been consistently decent. Wonderful place to have dinner if you're in the area and don't mind sitting outdoors and soaking in the vibes.
The food standard dropped significantly and more like a tourist trapped plc. Crazy overpriced for mediocre food.
"We were back from overseas and really missed our hawker fare. The dishes we had did not disappoint us.

However, we had an unpleasant experience with a vendor (we did not take note of the stall's name) who had placed their cutlery and plates on a table to reserve for their potential patrons. We were asked to leave the table alone. And we did, as we did not want to ruin our dinner plans and night.

Looks like a common practice for seafood and zhichar stalls."
Good variety of food stalls.
Best of the best
Plenty of nice local foods here.
"A good place to chill with your friends and loved ones.
Major draw back is the food quality can be better, the taste wise is quite average.
The view and the service is quite good"
Food are generally nice and affordable. Too much touting at near the satay area.
Great place to get all kinds of local food.
"This nostalgic place is always never a fail! Perfect for evenings and weekends, especially.. for us to be away from school/work, chill over a plate of satay, cockles, and more!"
All time favourite food can be found here.
Very cool local spot to eat  tasty and affordable food. Not too many vegetarian options but still some can be found. Nice local vibe as well!
Satay pork was delicious 
"Frequently having dinner here during my younger day. As uduzk, still lively."
"Stall No. 5

Great value for money. Had so many dishes and it didnt cost me a bomb. Very generous in portions!"
"Stay away from the satay stall located at the right corner. This is the most unhygienic and disgusting stall. The group of family members sat across me and I witnessed this elderly man manning the stall coughing non stop while handling my satay for the whole time. If I did not witness it, I will be eating germs of unhygienic food. NEA should inspect those hawker stalls with poor hygiene - without mask while coughing is totally unacceptable. Mind you he did not cover his mouth and cough directly at my food. Disgusting. I did not touch my food and dump everything in the bin.

Chicken wings from the Chinese stall is still the best!"
"Takes the atmosphere of a hawker centre and makes it better,  the food was delicious and clean, prices are a bit high though."
"Delicious hawker food. We had bbq chicken wings, satay and sambai stingray."
A lot of nice food here
"Today East Coast hawker food centre, even the seafood restaurants were super crowded. I was lucky to share a cosy seat with elderly couple who helped to reject others while I went for food order. But I did not have the luck to order yummy food. This was the worst Tomyam soup I ever had. Sweet and all ingredients were dipped in ocean of chili oil without any tomyam taste at all. The friendly couple, also disappointed with their satay and sweet-sauced squid kangkung, commented that my order appeared worse than theirs. They encouraged me to return whole bowl to the vendor and raise the issue. If they were the one who ordered it, they sure confronted the vendor. I initially thought to let the matter die off in silence and shun away from this hawker food forever. Then I took a picture giving it a shot to courteously  approach the stall. Guess what, the assistant not even asking to look at the photo immediately returned me S$8.50, the price I paid for. Stall 16."
"Long time since I been there the last time, a lot new stall, had bbq stingray, sambal seeet potato leaves, chicken wing, satay, and sugar cane drink, all taste good except the sweet potato leaves too oily.."
"Shi Wu Fen Liang Ming Xian Shao Liao Hen Duo,Jie Qian Ye Hen Gui ~Wei Dao Ye Bu Ru Yi Qian Liao "
"Good carrot cake, oyster omelette, Hokkien mee, and curry puffs"
All time favourite bbq stall. Nice stingray and Kai Lan. chilli very shiok! Neighbour stall selling baised pig leg very nice too. Seat I choose very hot next time will take outdoor seat 
"Although there's a huge open carpark, it's usually quite packed during dinner time. Once you have found a parking lot, you'll be spoilt for choice in terms of food selection. Although touting is not allowed, you'll see some satay stalls doing that. I supposed competition is stiff. Another challenge will be finding a seat. Not an issue if it's just a couple. Bigger groups will have to try their luck during peak hours."
One of the best hawker centre's in Singapore. Great atmosphere by the ocean and lake. Food is amazing. Good spot for chilli and pepper crab and all the Singapore hawker specialties.
"This is an over rated food center. Except for some dishes you can pay less for better menu. If you have to come then I strongly recommend (1) Duck rice & porridge, (2) beef noodles, (3) Sambal BBQ seafood (4) Malay satay... the rest you take your pick. Anything you pick here there's better & cheaper version elsewhere anytime."
If you are prepared to smell like BBQ then come.. food depends on which stall you place order..and also which food hits your taste buds. Overall.. its a nice hangout..
Another great place to enjoy food very good selection and beer located by the harbour worth a visit 
"I went there to have wan ton noodles.
It was delicious."
cheap n good local food by the Beach!
"Some shops accept grab payment, so you can use credit cards instead of Paylah or Paynow.

We tried the prawn balls, and satay, I think they have cheaper satay compared somewhere because it's around 0.80 cents only.

It's walking distance to the east coast park, we went there walking only from the marine cove area, it's around 2 kilometers with the kids on the stroller."
Beautiful place with lots of good food at great prices. Ample carpark space if you drive. Needs more shelter/ coverage during rainy weather though.
Yummy rodent... at the entrance of the hawker
"Dong Xi Du Bu Cuo,Jiu Shi Ren Tai Duo!"
"We went there at around 4-5pm before the dinner crowd came in on Sunday. Managed to get seats at the pondok (sheltered area).

Got lots of things to share like the oyster omelette, bbq prawns, satay (chicken,beef & babat[fat/tripe]) and kang kong.
The satay sauce was great, not too spicy. The chilli kicap (soya sauce chilli) didn't really have much of a kick and there was more soya sauce than actual chilli in it.

Definitely able to share between 6/7 people."

"I frequently visit with my friends and colleagues here. This is a good place to take a walk down to the beach after your dinner. It's not so windy so the atmosphere is with somewhat smoky in the dining area. Suggest you choose the table away from the BBQ shops. Service and food are same as usual we see in other food center across the island. Famous in BBQ chicken, stingray dish, sugar cane juice and many other."
Food is pricey for a hawker setting and not much crowd since jb border open
Food was superb and fantastic svc was the best and friendly will always come back for the bbq food and the salted egg crab my favorite 
Food ok but crowded as usual. Parking is difficult for peak hours.
Great place for outdoor dining
"We were having a farewell dinner for my sister-in-law from California. She missed the hawker food. So this place we chose was outdoor so it was hot  But the food and fellowship made up to it. The Satay and Stingray were my favourites. In fact all the food we ordered tasted sumptuous. We ordered Omelette oysters, shells, Indian Mee goreng, fried kangkong and sambal BBQ stingray, Tahu Bakar, Tulang. The food was just amazing and reasonably priced. The sugarcane drink was so refreshing. Do bring your friends and family over to East Coast Lagoon Food Village to taste sumptuous food you won't forget."
Weekday evenings are best. Get to sit nearest to the sea & the weather isn't scorching. Most stalls will bring food over to the tables.
Great spot to stop at during an ECP walk or bike ride. Satay is iconic.
Famous duck rice stall is there in the morning
It's very nice viewing to the sea 
"Satay, seafood and chicken wings are nice here."
Food is delicious but design of the roofs are horrendous.  Went there when it rained heavily and 80% of the seats got wet. Many people had to take shelter along the small sheltered walkways and near the toilet most stood waiting for 2 hours for the rain to stop. Would be more practical to design a hawker centre with a proper roof as it is the nearest shelter and food place people can go to if it rains.
"U do not go there for air con or nice seats. U go there for food. Today we tried food from stall 43 which is mainly seafood. We had stingray ( speciality), tiger prawns ( very huge), crab n buns and snails ( chugg chugg). What food. Stall 43 we will come again"
Wide variety of hawker food sold here that goes well with chilled beers. Tasty and traditional local food at reasonable prices. Near the beach and best for the evenings.
Tasty Local foods available
Food tasty n package in good shape.
Table not clean n not enough seats if family are more then 6. Hot alao
"There are just so many food stalls to choose from at East Coast Lagoon Food Village. I think this is one of the few food centres in Singapore that has a big representation of halal stalls. From satays, to Hokkien Mee, to Char Kuey Teow, you will definitely find something delicious to eat here. I will definitely try the BBQ dishes here next time.

For first time patrons, do note that you may seat at any tables regardless which stalls you order from. Some parts are sheltered while some may be partially sheltered. I think it may be a little hot in the afternoon, but the evening time was quite breezy."
Have been here a few nights to have dinner. It closes near to 10.30pm everyday. But i enjoy the food there so much.
Great place to dine out with families
"Overall food was fine, except the BBQ Prawn from the Sixty Satay, not fresh, smelly and the meat too soft."
"Very crowded. But lots of good food and variety! Popular stores sold out early and closed for the day!
Tables are clean and cleared up fast!"
"Food are overrated and over priced, mostly can get from other neighborhood hawker centers."
"Hadn't been here in probably 15 years. Nice to see what they've done with it.

They have a wide variety of stalls to choose from. The food we had was very good and reasonably priced. The stall owners we dealt with were very friendly.

Great location for a night out."
Came here for the second time to eat satay all the way by bicycle.  Nice chicken satay.  Sure to come again.
"Good food with reasonable price,everyone must try, recommend to come in evenings."
"A typical hawker centre. There are many stalls but repetitive food offerings. Unless one is a frequent visitor, it is difficult to sieve out the stalls which sell good and tasty food. Prices are exorbitant, even for stalls selling mediocre food. The only plus factor is the atmosphere, given its location next to the sea, so a resort feel."
Good find   
Great ambience in the evening.  Very cool too with a nice breeze.  Place is very clean.
Nice variety of food available
"One of the best hawker center in Singapore with lots of nice food at affordable price. There are many shops of nostalgic history suitable for cravings, gathering and even bringing non local friends to enjoy the local fanfare of delicacies."
Perfect spot. Tired from your run and cycling what better way to gain back those calories with a plate full of satays and bbq stingrays. Don't forget the essential big cup of sugarcane juice. No meal is complete without sugarcane juice.
wide range of typical hawker food offered with an extra focus on seafood at reasonable prices compared to the nearby seafood restaurants
"Very Good Satay here and Rojak too.

Fantastic area is not hot.

Good food"
Afternoon crowd not as vibrant as in the evening.
"Always a favorite, Horan has the best satay"
"There is a great variety, something for everyone. And super affordable. The pork belly satay is delicious and the beer buckets are perfect to share. The seating is pretty limited, especially on weekends but there is a ton of space close to the water."
"Not sure what to eat, just watch the queue & the answer is there.  The 2 favorite stalls I love is the BKT & Duck Rice stall. Check it out yourself. However, afternoon crowd is little due to the heat. Although they ve indoor seating with monster fans, it is still pretty warm. Most stalls open after 5 pm or 6 pm. Recommended better as a dinner place. A stroll in the park after dinner just completes the experience."
Tres cher pour ce que l'on a a manger. The glace incroyable!
Spacious and well lit food court with endless food options! Fabulous seafood stall with very flavourful umami. Absolutely value for money! We will definitely return to try other stalls in the future 
"The food was wonderful. Ordered satay, fried squid, sambal stingray, kang kong, oyster omellete for 4 pax. We realized we overordered when all the food arrived but it tasted great.

A negative point is the tissue peddlers who try to force you to purchase the tissue by dropping them on your table. It was pretty disrespectful. Someone should scold them for behaving that way"
Nice place
Nice place to chill
"Great choices of food. And many similar stalls. Locals will know and have their own favourite.
Enjoy!"
Wonderful place to go during weekends
Always a good place to be in. Many options. Most of the times come here to hanging around with friends. Easy access to beach and easy access to food. Fantastic.
"Fei Chang Qing Song Shu Shi De Shi Ge,Ti Gong Duo Yang Hua De Shi Wu Xuan Ze Gen Yin Liao,Kai Fang De Shi Wai Kong Jian Fei Chang Shu Shi,Lin Jin Dong Hai An,You Hen Duo Ren Lai Zuo Xiu Xian Huo Dong. "
Very crowded during evening hours. Either go early or go late like 9 plus. But you're spoiled for options here
"Must stop here if you are at east coast... close in terms of range of makkan like Newton Hawker centre but better. 1st its @ East Coast so you have some sea breeze, 2nd Best range of Satay anywhere this side of Kajang (KL) and 3rd, Price is reasonable and you get to have a scenic walk after your meal if you need to work it off a little..
Packed on the weekends (PM) so it pays to get there a little early :)"
Is a nice place for meet up old friend gatherings and also for couples. Foods is delicious and can enjoy the night view of the ships park in Singapore sea
Always a nice place for good food and drinks. At Hawker pricing and standard.
Amazing food and so much variety
"Good old place with a great variety of local favourites and seafood. BBQ Chicken Wings, Sambal stingray, Black pepper Crayfish, Chilli Crabs, Satay and many more. Many stalls to choose from so I guess everyone has their own favourite stall. It is usually crowded during dinner but on weekends it might take awhile to get a table / seating. If it's crowded, food takes awhile to be served and it's self service for some of the stalls here. Food prices are reasonable here. Food quality depends on which stall you order from. Huge parking with lots but is full peak periods so might have to wait to get a lot. Many more parking lots along East Coast Park if you are willing to walk abit."
The best rojak so far.. been coming here for their nice rojak.
It was raining heavily so me and my boyfriend didn't enjoy all the seats were wet...
Good food and nicer people working there!! Even the cleaners were so helpful and friendly!! Awesome!!
"One of my faves hawkers. Aside from being by the seaside, most stalls have great food. Very yum! Haven't eaten anything that's not yummy here. Faves are Duck Rice, Crispy roast pork, popiah and lime juice. Great to eat also around 4pm and sit on the side by the beach, its calming."
"Choose from different stalls like sate, bbq chicken, grilled sting-ray, or fried rice."
"Getting very expensive to eat here, but the atmosphere still makes up for it."
"My go-to place for a weekday dinner, the crowd and the ambience is lively."
"That was all kind of seafood, the satay is great! All kinds of local refreshments like fresh coconut juice,  sugar cane juice, and more. Normally, the weekend is very busy."
"Best hawker center in Singapore surrounded by a beautiful park. Must go eatery.
Seems like the satay stalls are taking way too long to deliver. Asking for order is prompt but not the delivery."
wide variety of dining options & great location by the beach
Good place for picnics
I love this place! Good food and good location
"Haron satay : The best halal satay
Ahmad spring chicken wings: the best halal bbq wings"
"Weekends are always a challenge. Today was no different. Due to the weekend crowd, parking lots are competitive. However, it was worth it."
Food so so and oyster fried egg not fresh...
"Great ambience to dine in hawker fare especially barbecues and seafood. Alfresco open air seating as well as covered verandas with fan ventilating the surroundings. Highly recommend Haron Satay stall.

Stalls touting at customers can get a little annoying however. Lots of halal stalls as well."
Good local good hawker centre. My favourite Wanton Mee and Beef Soup
"Yesterday dated  20/1/24 went to this place,food not bad,lots of satay stall, mutton soup,seafood  etc .  I would suggest if the bus 401 can operate everyday  would be greatso that I can come down frequently . Bus stop a bit dark no light regarding toilet not clean enough and no lights dark scared if got snakes etc no toilet spray  to cleanup the bowl for hygenic purpose. I went there around 4pm until 8+ pm.Hope the management could upgrade the atmosphere and facilities. Rainy days quite slippery ."
Poorly maintained. Need to improve the smoke situation from Satay shops. Too much smoke everywhere.
"There are many stalls, we tried the most highly recommended ones. The carrot cake one was great, didn't like the fried oysters and chicken wings, that were crazy heavy. Pork noodles and mixed satay very  nice, hokkien prawn mee tasteless and overcooked. Couldn't try the curry puffs as the stall was closed. I think it's a bit of a hit or miss. Nice vibrant atmosphere by the beach."
delicious food with cheap price
Hot drinks. Not many shops. Gotta go a big round to get coffee.
My favorite place for a sugar cane fix after long jogs. So much memories.
Great good. Great ambience!
BBQ chicken & Or Luat!!!!!!
We came here for an early lunch so only limited vendors were open. Still had a good selection to choose from. One of the best Hawker centres in Singapore in my opinion being located right next to the sea and park. Had a nice open and relaxed feel with some cooling breeze from the sea. Nice place to come to relax.
"My family and I was there to get satay and because the weather is not at our side, we have to take away the satay instead of our plan to dine there. Eventhough it's raining the food and atmosphere is still good."
Hip & happening
Place is too crowded! Its hard to find a place to sit. Need to shamelessly wait for other to finish their food near them or others will take the place before you.
"Mostly the food here is very good,service also good, people who sell satay will approach you and ask to buy from them and they will send u the food, drinks too so service also 5 stars
But the atmosphere is another thing its very dirty there and a lot of mosquitoes and ants all over the place so since it's a food centre still have to give it to them "
"Bring cash, they don't take credit cards. The food is just average like every other hawkers."
Most stalls r closed. Food wise is below national standards
Amazing food!
"Good place to chill, not much stalls opening on a weekday. Almost similar pricing as Newtown food centre."
"Very relaxing place at the beachside to enjoy a mug of beer, cold sugarcane juice and oysters egg (""or jian"") and fresh cockles. As a Malaysian visiting Singapore, I approve of the delicious meals and beautiful views. The satay is not bad too."
Most of the food is nice! Highly recommended
Great family boring place to sit and eat
Really nice good. Satay was great.
"Probably Singapore's favourite FC.
Wif seaside, playground, jogging, cycling tracks, beside it, & clean restrooms makes tis country proud.
And I haven't mentioned the food.
Damn it's popularity, always has a parking problem during holidays & weekends"
"We ordered Ikan bakar (stingray), fried rice, kangkung, satay, lala, cereal prawns..cant go wrong right ? Well, very average taste and overpriced. I don't mind paying more but the portions and quality need to live up to it. My recommendation if you crave such food is to head down to Tang Tea House in Simpang Bedok. Way better, tastier and hearty portions."
The Soy pork trotter was awesome. The muffin satay from Malay stall and fried oyster were nice too
Beef noodles
Tons of seats around and may have to wait a little but food choices was worth the wait!
The food was really good
Great place
A classic goodie after the old Satay place. Need to come early to get seats or waiting time about 20mins at peak hours.
"Hen Fang Song De Di Fang,Ke Yi Zuo Zai Gong Gong De Wei Zhi Shang,Dian Zhe Bu Tong De Mei Shi,Gen Zhu Ji Ge Hao You Yi Qi Liao Tian Bing Xiang Shou Mei Shi. "
Lots of good food here.
Not healthy food. Will affect your health
"Lots of seafood, chicken wings and Satay stall. Enjoy sea breeze while you dine there. Used to have an uncle singing there. No longer see him singing there."
"In terms of the quality of food I'm sure you will be satisfied  but variety is sparse should I say, three main stall you'll see over there satay, barbeque chicken and zi char.
Service was excellent  never seen a proactive hawker asking people if they want their food or not, food is also delivered straight to your table if you give them your table number.
For the ambiance, you can see for yourself in the photo that it looks really nice and is a great place to hang out with friends.
Overall, a solid 4.6 for me."
"My favourite hawker centre in the East of Singapore. They have the best barbecue food and local delights. They have plenty of seats for both sheltered and non sheltered. They have several tray return stations and basins for washing hands.

2. Fried Yuan Yang Carrot Cake and Fried Kway Teow from Tong Xin
3. Fried Hokkien Prawn Mee

5. The mutton, pork and chicken satay meat are tender and grilled to perfection
6. Rojak is good and portion is quite big for small portion
7. Refreshing sugar cane drinks"
"A hawker centre by the beach, as usual... Satay, Zi Cha, Hokkien mee, oyster omelette etc.."
Very comfortable and relaxing place.  Diverse food options and close to the sea.  It is a very suitable area for leisure activities.
"Cool place to come and with a nice variety of cuisines to choose from. Great food and value.

We came a bit early so not all stalls were opened."
"Stay away from this stall very expensive for chicken rice
$8 for this saulty chicken rice"
"Food here is more expensive than other Food Centre. Ordered a plate of normal chicken rice from Siang Yuen chicken rice store charged $6.00 while other food centre charged average $4~5.00. Nothing special about the chicken rice taste below average, that's why no queue."
Toilet was horrible
"Bruh the birds be haunting me
!"
An expensive place to dine but the food is good. I don't buy seafood so I can't comment on the quality and price.
I guess many knew this place.... never get tired eating here.... Price is Ok and please don't increase anymore :-(
Great Place To Eat Fabulous Delicious  Foods & Best Of All It's By The Seaside
"Fantastic place,  shame the satay stalls don't open earlier (only available after 1pm)"
The chicken wing and fried hokkien mee was delicious 
NICE PLACE FOR LOTS OF DIFFERENT FOOD. GREAT STINGRAY BUT THE SATE WAS REALLY GOOD!
Expperience the old Saigon
"Great place for local food. A must try for tourists visiting Singapore. Many different dishes ranging from satay to carrot cake and even seafood and also many different drink options. Environment here is quite clean, but on rainy days dining in would be a problem. Numerous parking lots available outside. Prices here are not the lowest you'll find in Singapore but the quality is commendable."
Hats off one of the best pad thai noodles I've had! You can tell that they used minimal oil in their noodles and I LOVED THAT 
"Tried one of the Malay Stay stores,  90 cents per piece.  They are also80 cents too fom other store. Taste not as good as older time."
Amazing Street food
Wonderful local experience.
Superb relaxing atmosphere.  Love it. However the carpark is super expensive....even they charge us on public holiday. WELCOME TO XINCHIAPORE...
"This white carrot cake from shop name ""YEN KEE"" is AMAZING. Literally AMAZING. So flavourful and it goes extremely well with their sambal. This could literally be the best I mean BEST carrot cake I've encountered. Even the texture of the carrot cake and the egg is amazing. MUST TRY"
Plenty of local food choice. It's crowd with local and foreigners.
"Good varieties in the food center, it would be a nice venue for a nice cool breeze evening dinner."
Dai Peng You Lai Chi Di Dao De Xin Jia Po Mei Shi. Fei Chang You Fen Wei Gan De Shi Ge. 
Great chill out place to hangout with friends 
A place must go if you want to try all the local foods. Seafoods are fresh and cheaper than Newton .
"A wonderful place to sit and eat with family, on a cool night next to the beach."
Curry puff not bad. Cost $1.8
Environment and food is good
"No public transportation, need to take a grab. There are many activities to do here ex. Walking to the beach or rental a bicycle. Dont forget to return all the leftover food & the tray to the designated spot."
Good food and many varieties. The place was clean and tidy.

Dining by the beach
Food nowadays expensive and not as good too.
Good selection of food and I would say prices and taste is better than what you get at Newton. Saw a tiny rat running around but I guess you can't avoid it when it's an open air hawker centre with lots of left over food.
"Great variety of food and relaxed athmosphere. As a foreigner, remember to bring cash or set up locally accepted digital payment methods, VISA did not work."
"Great hawker seafood to treat yr overseas frens without breaking the bank . I've ordered from stall 37 , no pork no lard . Seafood are fresh especially the crabs ! Gave me with roe too . The cooking gave wok hey , love it !"
Plenty of touting as usual for a touristy place and fairly humid if there's no breeze. Food is quite over priced. Taste so-so and mediocre compared to what locals can find elsewhere. Overall three stars.
"Been a while since i last went there. Satay 55 is not open and got the satays from stall 59 instead. Honestly, prefer stall 55 alot more as its more tender and aromatic. Had the usual fare of bbq wings, satay bee hoon and oyster omelette since the best 3 stalls are like side by side with each other. Loving it."
"Wonderful hawker with many varieties. Came here a year ago before they renovated, now its much cleaner and airy.

Food standard has improved alot too! Love their wide range of local delicacies, ventilation is much better too compared to before when the smoke will be trapped in the hawker itself. Definitely a place never to miss especially for tourist wanting to try different local delights."
"Ini lokasi paling enak buat olahraga dan kulineran sih! Paling pas banget. Aku sih akan jadiin tempat ini jadi yang paling wajib didatengin, karena biaya masuknya free, meja-mejanya free, jadi kita bisa explore makanan yang memang aga sedikit mahal 50cent sampai 1 dollar dari biasanya, sama bisa main2 sepeda dan lain-lain! Selain itu, tempatnya panjang banget dan luas sekalii, jadi kalo kamu ada waktu 3-4 jam, ini bisa bgttt jadi tempat wisata. Selain itu, disini paling terkenal sugar cane (kayanya almost di seluruh singapore ini ada), jadi pas banget liat-liat pantai dan minum air tebu yang enak dan murah (paling mahal 3 dollar deh).

Bahasa Inggris:
This is the best location for sports and culinary delights! The most fitting. I'm going to make this place the most must-visit place, because the entry fee is free, the tables are free, so we can explore the food which is a bit more expensive at 50 cents to 1 dollar than usual, and we can ride bicycles and so on! Apart from that, the place is really long and very wide, so if you have 3-4 hours, this could really be a tourist spot. Apart from that, the sugar cane here is the most famous (I think there are almost all of Singapore), so it's perfect to check out the beach and drink delicious and cheap sugar cane juice (the most expensive is 3 dollars)."
"Food is generally ok, but more expensive than many other food centres.
Went there in the morning, very few stores opened, very few patrons, but many tables were not clean. What happened to the cleaners?"
"Just your slightly above average hawker centre, value for money tho."
Good food. Be friendly and you'll get good service!
"Visited weekday 1pm
Not many stalls open
Limited choice n hot day"
Nice to see this traditional stall selling grilled stuffed fried tofu and chinese cruellers. 38 years old stall
"Place full of vibes, but inadequate fans.
Should install more fans, to beat the heat while eating cos the seafood here is super hot and spicy "
"Not bad at all. Lots of choices, price is reasonable"
The food here are amazing!
Good place for family activities. But the food is more expensive than regular hawker centre though.
Reasonable price
Love local eat local 
open air hawker food close to beach
Quite hot at day time visit
Nice place to have dinner with your family and friends. Kinda hard to find parking and a table during peak hours! 
There is alot of bbq seafood and satay stalls. The area near the atm is not so stuffy and heaty. The zou ji duck rice and curry puff is good.
"Avoid peak hour periods, else the long wait for seats and food. Many stalls selling the same type of food so better to do some research before ordering . For eg I would recommend the chicken satay at Haron"
"Haron satay nice but eat this place dirty and crowded. Wish tables can clean with soap and floor mop.

Must choose stall properly order satay, not all nice. Malay indian fd here so so only. When they serve on styrofoam plate, not as nice liao

Want nice FD, go gaylang market. Come for sweaty sticky atmosphere with satay and chix wings. And if u non halal, can have yr beer with it.

061023: coem here after so long. Last I come was before COVID. Don't le, may be. Satay haron not as nice as before."
"Schoner Food Court mit einer zahlreichen Auswahl. Man muss nicht lange anstehen, es sind genugend Sitzmoglichkeiten zur Verfugung und mit Luftern ist es gut auszuhalten.
Das Essen an den einzelnen Standen war durchwegs hervorragend."
"Expensive Rojak that was not delicious.Youtiao and Taupo are too hardened when mixed.
The Pork and Chicken Satays at Chong Pang Huat are hardened after about 10 minutes of slow eating from us.The Satay Dip does not even taste like Satay,just a bowl of Shredded Peanut and with very mild Satay fragrance.
Geylang 29 Charcoal Fried Hokkien Mee was good not great because of the hardened cooked prawn which were just added 10 seconds to the cooked noodles and then served to customers.
Overall experience,
Some hawkers are losing customers because of the dishes they served and that is not a good sign.
Rental is high yet they still cook and prepare sub-standard food.....TBC."
Best hawker center atmosphere and food since the early 80s. Choon Hiang hokkien mee is highly recommended!!!! Damn nice
Particularly fresh and cheap foods can get here.
"A very busy food centre. Waited nearly 30 minutes for a parking lot. Very, very few empty tables. Had to wait for the dinners to finish their meal before a table is available. Many Satay stalls. Many stalls selling chicken wings, too. There were also stalls selling oysters omelette, grilled seafood, char kuay teow, hokkien mee etc etc. The place looks clean..."
"A vibrant place for dining and gatehring with friends, especially busy n the evening. The satay stalls that feature grilling of satay sticks is very interesting to watch. Food is a bit pricey, and quality is passable, but nothing to write home about."
Many food stalls with many seats. Not hard to find a seat to enjoy dinner at weekend.
"Spoiled choice of food , can have drink or breakfast or lunch after walking around East Coast Park"
When to Harun satay stall.. ordered satay and bbq chicken wings..on Saturday night ..have to wait for an hour to collect the satay but it's all worthwhile as the satay were delicious so too the bbq chicken wings..
"Was there yesterday afternoon, not so busy. Guess it's weekday"
We eat satay and hokian mee fried rice and more
"We were surprised on the popularity of this place. So crowded. The food was good, and priced reasonably. Loved the coconut drink."
Generally a good hawker place. Just that it is really hot and fans are limited in the late mornings.
Highly recommended to bring your guests overseas to try out a range of good food! The satay and chicken wings were amazing! My friend from Korea enjoyed himself and great way to catch up over good food and a Tiger Beer :)
Good place to taste local foods
hawker center located near the sea
After a good walk it is the perfect place to share and enjoy something delicious.
Lovely  choices  of seafood.  Not easy to park the car at weekends .
"Wonderful hawker center with plenty of food options! There's something for everyone...

Satay got many stalls to choose from, meats are very tender and juicy, snowy taste from the grilling.

Duck rice is yummy with the thick gravy, very friendly owners and staff who seems to know many of the regular customers.

Fried hokkien noodles, super savoury from the prawn stock. Pairs well with the chili!

Overall must eat, will come here again try the other stalls, more open in the evening."
Never disappoint. Chicken satay nice. Beef satay if tender would be nice. Prawn awesome. Chicken wing with chilli is awesome.
"Good variety of tasty food, ranging from sambal sting ray to satay to char kway tiao to Hokkien mee, roasted chicken wings, fried prawn paste chicken wings and more.
Might be a little warm during noon time but the center has improved shelter and this has made eating there during noon time more plausible.
The helping sizes are reasonable. The food texture are mostly good.
It's a great place to go after a long cycle or roller blade or walking session.
You won't expect the best service here but some stalls serve you.
But do note that the evenings might be a little busy for these stalls."
"Food getting expensive, some store sells sugar cane, just like water"
"Update: 2023
Inflation causes Price hike. Abit too much for the amount charging vs e food u are getting esp seafood.
Still OK but no lt as good as before...

Best place for makan all local dishes without burning a hole in pocket... Place for foodie, lot of carpark space. Dbs atm is just around the corner. Do come early during wkend."
Standard drop. Satay and fried food not as tasty as before.
"Why now many dog around there and some pee anyhow on the grass, and the sand have dog poo. Its hard for us when wanna sit down there."
"East Coast Hawker is a culinary gem that I can't recommend enough! The variety of dishes they offer is truly impressive. From the mouthwatering satay and succulent BBQ chicken wings to the flavorful fried Hokkien mee and fried oyster, every bite is a delightful experience.

One standout dish for me was the Sambal sting ray fish, a unique and delicious option that's a must-try. And don't forget to quench your thirst with their refreshing sugarcane drinks.

The ambiance is great for casual dining, and the staff are always welcoming and attentive. Whether you're a local or just passing through, East Coast Hawker is a culinary adventure you won't want to miss. It's a place where taste buds are tantalized, and I can't wait to return for more."
"Went at 5+pm. Carpark still packed, tables are available and queue for food is quite reasonable. Smoky in some areas depending where you sit. Satay areas are mostly smoky.
Trying other stalls for fried Oyster hokkien mee and satay. Sugar cane drinks can't be missed too.
After 6+, many people will queue not just tables but also carpark is hell."
Nice grilled stingray
"I was there on a tuesday night. There is enought place for dining and parking.

Ordered song kee fried oyster, satay, bbq wings, clams,stingray.
Coconut drink.

Everything is tasty here"
"Beautiful bustling atmosphere with good, inexpensive food. Food portions are decent and the pricing affordable. The quality of the food generally is quite good and delicious."
"A huge hawker center in tbe east and right by the beach. Doesnt smell so smokey or feel so grimy like other old hawker centers as it's quite open here and the cooling from the sea wind. Lots of types of food served here, almost everything typically found out there and more. Seafood zi char stalls looked good and it would be a ideal place to grab a meal after walking along the east coast beach."
An exception selection of local food at affordable prices in a huge food center overlooking the sea along East Coast. The setup is self service and remember to clear your food to the bin and tray return so others can enjoy a clean table after you. Highly recommended. Especially for dinner and an evening stroll along the beach afterwards.
"Revitalise place, food is better but why so many barbecue stalls???a better variety is needed."
Crowded place in the weekend but nice hawker food
Avoid Jacky's beverages for sugar cane. Ordered big cup but diluted.
"comfortable space, delicious food is so amazing"
Went there at about 5pm it is already very crowded. Recommended by a friend to try the wanton noodle; fried oyster omelette; BBQ chicken: satay bee hoon etc. Personally i like the BBQ chicken wing from this stall i posted. Next to chicken wing is the fresh big  coconut water we bought which is really good to hydrate after a long walk. Can visit but best to be earlier ;)
super crowded but good food
"One of the iconic hawker centres in singapore!

Great food and atmosphere!"
"Went for the famous cha siew noodles but it was closed (Monday). In fact, many stalls were closed because Monday means no fresh pork is available from the abattoir.
We had the braised pork trotter with vegetables, oyster omelette, 1 pohpiah and a curry puff.
Everything was yummy. The pork trotter (red signboard, same row as the cha siew noodles) was tender and flavourful. The skin was collagen rich and tasted wonderful with rice. Oyster omelette was a tad oily but had a few plump and fresh oysters to cut the grease. Pohpiah was an appetizer and the curry puff served as dessert. We washed the food down with 100% natural sugar cane juice. Every element worked together to give us a sweet, salty, yummy, umami-rich meal. Our hawker food is definitely worthy of the UNESCO's citation as stated by S'pore's National Heritage Board, ""Hawker Culture in Singapore was successfully inscribed as Singapore's first element on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity on 16 Dec 2020.""
Perhaps the sea breeze from East Coast Park where the food centre is sited enhances the ambience and experience."
Great hawker! Took my friends who were visiting Singapore. Much better than Lau Pa Sat which is just very touristy.
"Ordered a fried black carrot cake from a stall with red banner. The carrot cake is nicely presented and not mushy. It still maintain the shape and able to taste the radish.
Also ordered popiah from the one and only popiah stall. The garlic taste is a bit too strong for me. The skin is too thick."
"Everything was good , the rice, the duck meat and the soup "
"This is a typical Singapore hawker centre. I highly recommend tourists to visit the hawker centre instead of the famous restaurants street. Why?

1. There are plenty of choices for you to choose. Satay, chicken wings, crabs, fried rice, noodles, stingray, etc. Match your food with sugar cane juice... perfecto.

2. Price is reasonable. Your pockets will have a hole if u dine at Long Beach, Jumbo for example... but ur wallet is safe here.

3. Clean and spacious.

4. Well ventilated. Airy.

Do note to have your dinner early if you are going on a weekend. Early as in 5pm to 6pm. The later you go, the harder it is for u to get a table."
Nice weekend hideout
This is a unique local Singapore experience. Lots of stalls to choose from. Mostly locals. It can be hard to find a table as it is very busy.
Value meals by the seaside. The one and only food centre within a beach park in Singapore. Always enjoy the stroll to nearby Bedok Jetty after meals.
Very windy and cooling especially if you sit behind at the last row of the hawker center nearer to the lagoon. A lot of award winning dishes here. The ice-cream stand just in from of the hawker centre has premium flavours such as cookie and cream and salted caramel brownie. Always crowded.
amazing satay and fried chicken wings and the seaside atmosphere is one of the reasons I still love Singapore because you really cannot find this kind of experience anywhere else on the planet.
Difficult to access without driving. The food prices are affordable and good.
Just getting too expensive!!
Nice hawker but a bit on the more expensive side.
Huan Ke Yi Shi Wu Wei Dao Yi Ban Ban Bu Shi Hen Xin Xian
Really depends on your preference for nice clean and airconditioned environment or the smoky satey / chicken wing stalls...
"#35~Nice lok lok..
All item $1.. Must try..."
Always love a good satay n bbq chicken wings when visiting this place.
Good food good service but atmosphere eroded by the employed cleaner. Every diner had closed the bin cover after their trash. The lady cleaner employed just dumped her rubbish and left the cover open. When questioned she answered in mandarin must close huh say la...cleaner has no common sense for hygiene!!!!
Crowd during weekend and holidays
"It's been decades since I was last here. It's a nice to see the govt has maintained this premium hawker center well. The seaside view remains unobstructed. The mixture of food options remain the same with a focus on satay and sea food. The restrooms are clean, and the tables updated. It's hard to get a table after 6. We had an enjoyable meal there."
Alot nice foods n nice malay satay must try .
The satay tt we ordered fr one of the stall doesn't meet my tastebud. Shd hv order fr Haron Satay instead.
"classic place to visit, ate satay, cuttlefish kang kong and wanton mee, the wanton mee soup is rly good :)"
"East Coast Lagoon Food Village is another reason why the East still reigns as Singapore's best place to eat. A stop at the East Coast Lagoon Food Village is a must for foodies visiting Singapore or any foodies based in Singapore. Located on Singapore's Eastern shore at the wake-boarding lagoon East Coast, this popular dining location serves everything from hot seafood laksa to sweet and savoury satay.

Some people call this the ""Newton Circus of the East"", which is understandable because there are several Fried hawker foods (Hokkien Mee, Fried Oyster, Char Kway Teow), BBQ Chicken Wings, Grilled Seafood, Sugarcane juice stalls and the like.

As Singapore's only hawker centre by the beach, this is probably the only hawker centre people aren't complaining about the heat.

With an excellent variety of stalls and relaxed atmosphere, it's no wonder East Coast Lagoon Food Village is a popular haunt on the weekend. The East is truly a foodie paradise."
"Great choices and reasonable prices. Too bad the beach access is closed off now, lost the best attraction of this place. But still good for a late night dinner and a walk on the beach after."
"Tried the wanton for $6. Will never try again. Noodle not q, Taste.... No taste, wanton also cannot make."
Not all tables have shelter from sun or rain.
The only food I will comment on is the Duck with Yam Rice.  I feel its still one of the best in Singapore.
Food was good if you know which store to go to. You have to reach early in order to find a seat. Pricewise was average. Not cheap and not too expensive.
"The worst or-luak ever tasted.  Not well fried, tasteless.  Never again."
"Enjoyed the oyster omelette, and chilli crab. The sambal stingray was a bit of a disappointment. Could do better."
"Love this place, food beside breach "
Nice seafood and duck rice over here
"Over rated place. Only a few nice stores. Crowded as expected, it is the only food court at hawker centre price along the beach"
"Myself,  1st born & gf, we cycle almost 3hrs fm Changi Beach to ECLFV. Break our fast here. Nice sea view at night. Food is good."
"Peak periods are definitely something to avoid.  Not only will you struggle to find a place to sit, the food wait time can take as long as an hour. Prices have gone up significantly over the years, especially for seafood. There are other better alternatives when it comes to food but the close proximity to the beach is a positive."
Most of the stall food is delicious.
"Extra $0.50 to $2
So so"
"A huge food center located right off the water in East Coast Park. Parking is convenient with a huge lot here. Every food stall here is a gem and I can't say enough about how good everything I ate was. Get satay skewers, get some Korean squid, get rice noodles with pork, get anything you want and you won't be disappointed. There is a particularly good curry puff stall here as well in the corner of the food center. Seating is free seating, so grab a seat and go order at the stall. Some of the stalls that serve up food that takes longer to cook will ask for your table number and they'll bring the food over once it's ready. Another thing I always get here is the massive lime juice :)"
"Went on a weekday late afternoon. Most stalls were closed. Limited options. Malay Satay is still good!

The most reliable stalls are prolly the Malay stalls and the seafood bbq stalls.

Loved the outdoor and open-air seats. Perfect for a cooling after rain evening. Noticed the outdoor area facing the sea have been cordoned off. Slightly disappointed as the sea view and sea breeze is blocked off."
Great place to take a bite after taking a stroll or just enjoying the sea breeze
Very crowded place on weekend but food is delicious.
There's lots of stalls with delicious food.  I particularly like Cheok Kee Duck Rice.  They also have Duck Porridge too.
Today less crowded
Lousy service n food
"Many good food, award duck rice, famous pork leg , chicken rice and more"
My 1st trip there after many years. The food stalls are not as good as before. Not worth going if you do not live nearby.
"If you know what to order, this is a nice place to visit from time to time. ""Watch out for the monkeys!"" Says the hawker "
I love the satays there !
"Great vibes on a weekend night. But you will have to be very patient with the wait time, especially with the popular stalls. Expect to wait around 45-1hr fr your order to be ready. The seating area will be packed so bring along some picnic essentials so that you can enjoy your food by the beach instead.

Good selection of popular local food and drinks. They split the HALAL and Non HALAL stalls so look out for the correct section.

There are parking lots nearby but will be full during mealtimes so park further up and walk about 5-10 mins."
Good place for beer and dinner of local food .
"A great array of street food, plenty to choose from
Cool breeze, open venue"
"Too crowded for both the carpark as well as the eateries.

It's almost impossible to dine there if you are alone.

Overall environment is quite clean, but hot and humid with not much ventilation, especially when all the stalls are cooking."
"Is the very hot place and Clouded with peoples, not enough table have to look and wait for it. Buying food also need to que ."
"Nice place for the family, with nice varieties of good food. Try Haron's Satay and the oyster omelette  The seafood is nice too."
Great seafood at reasonable prices. I prefer the stall number 3&4 (look for cyan blue signboard)
"This is the place you can enjoy the best sea food in the country. I heard they import crabs from Sri Lanka. Very tasty. You can enjoy a Tiger beer with spicy sea food in the evening looking at the sun set view. Very busy place. For a friends gathring or after business meeting celebrations , this is the ideal place. Better you make a booking in advance. Sometimes car park may be full. But can manage to find a place."
Food was great.
Nice ikan bakar and satay
It's a good place to get something to drink and eat when you feel dying of a long walk
Do come early to avoid crowded best hawker centre by seaside and always must try the satay but hard to recommend a satay stall alot.
"Vibrant spot near the beach and park. Good atmosphere and decent food options, especially for those who enjoy BBQ and satay"
Perfect place for a pit stop after a nice bike ride along East Coast Park.
"Good place to eat, especially at night. Enough table for big groups"
Always come during the day for Chok Kee duck rice which is excellent value and great service.
A little crowded for my liking but food is good.
"Chili Crab, Ya Hui chicken wings are great! Hao Jian stir fried oyster was a bit too oily for me. Chop a seat early it could get crowded before 6pm on weekends"
"Adimann is inconsistent. One moment everything is so good, & the next visit they're mediocre."
"Ate at one of the malay seafood shops. Stingray was good with more then usual sambal. Kampong friend rice was lumpy though. Could have been better.
The chicken soaked in egg sauce was not bad either. They served to the table so that was nice."
"I was here for lunch to try the famous bak kut teh place. It was delicious. I went there around 11am so not many stalls were opened. Atmosphere wise, during day visit, you can certainly find empty tables to sit. During dinner, its almost impossible to find empty table unless you wait for customers whom are currently eating."
This is the only food centre in Singapore that's so close to the Beach... varieties of foods for your selection prices is of mid range compare to neighborhood stalls....Weekend will be crowded so do turn up early.
Nice view of the sea from this hawker centre.... not all food stalls are open during the day.

"Food is just ok. Pre covid and after covid no difference. Overhype, over price and just go to spize for better tasting food."
"Great selection of local fare. Ranging from Chinese, Malay and Indian delicacies. Fantastic place to come and enjoy a walk along the beach"
Not the best food I've had in Singapore but still okay. Needs more fans.
"BBQ stingray - Try asking hone stall the assistant like so stuck up when I queried about the price saying the price is there so that's that.
Second stall #01-22, the guy instantly said for one person plus is $13 plus rice.
Wow! It's really what I called excellent as the stingray not watery plus the chilli is best. Good quality rice as well. Can give it a try if happen to be here. Hungry "
"Great place to dine after chilling at the beach 

Place gets extremely crowded but the hawker has a huge seating area and place is well ventilated despite the smoky BBQ stalls. Even if you can't find a seat it's nice to take away and eat by the sea 

Standard order:
- Sambal stingray
- Vegetable
- Satay
- Sugarcane with Lemon 

But do note to BE CAREFUL when ordering the sugarcane juice... I didn't ask for the price before ordering and it's $4 for a cup  even though it came at a big cup but still...?!?!"
Fun place to dine but can get very crowded and stuffy at night especially on weekends and public holiday. Lots of varieties of food but can be quite pricey. Overall experience 7/10
A must visit for anyone who enjoys great local Singaporean food.
Super long queue during weekend...song kee oyster undercooked and not fresh.Haran satay overgrilled become black colour and hard to chew.will not come next time...
Hot weather. But good place to gather. Alot of food choices..
I went here for lunch around 4pm. The food here is really good. I got some great carrot cake and thai food here is one of most value for money thai food in singapore. The kai lan and egg is amazing. I really like this place especially after a good cycle.
"You will love this place if you enjoy hunting for a table in hot and humid conditions, walking in and out of drifting satay smoke. But that's part of the experience! And it's enjoyable and deeply Singaporean.
Food choice is varied and mostly of high quality. Prices are higher than neighborhood hakwer center but still cheaper than the tourist trap that is Newton Circus.
It would be a solid 5 star hawker if finding a table was easier!
The sugarcane juice is always a winner"
"East Coast Lagoon Food Village is a highly recommended food center in Singapore. Nestled beside a scenic lagoon, this food haven offers a variety of local Singaporean dishes that cater to a wide range of preferences.

Each stall has its own specialty and contributes to the rich array of choices. Standouts include Satay, Laksa, and fresh Seafood, which are cooked with precision and skill. The food here is consistently good, serving up flavorful, authentic local cuisine that delivers on both quality and quantity.

The atmosphere is casual and lively, with the continuous hum of patrons adding to the overall charm. Seating can be a bit of a challenge during peak hours, but the turnover is quick.

Accessibility is great with ample parking nearby, and the view of the lagoon offers a unique dining experience. Service at the stalls is typically efficient and straightforward.

Overall, East Coast Lagoon Food Village provides a delightful culinary experience, giving you a taste of Singapore's food culture in a single location."
"Love this place! Really nice to dine with fresh air and good breeze sometimes. It's nice to chill by the sea. Also, lots of amazingly good food! Only issue is that it can get crowded at certain times and you'd have to wait for a seat. However, it's totally fine off peak hours. Love that there's a huge variety of good food too!"
Hei Xin Shang Jia Gan Zhe Shui Jia Bai Kai Shui Lai Mai
"Song Ji fried oysters, lor 29 fried hokkien mee is must order dishes"
The best place when craving for bbq chicken wings and satay.
"This place was a new find for me and my friends. None of us have been there before.. We had planned a big gathering of 6 families to meet up at the beach n then hv dinner here at the Lagoon Food Village. Unfortunately, rain played spoilsport that day  and we had to change our plans. Since most of the dining areas are under umbrella like structures and its open all around, the place got soaking wet. It was overcrowded once it started raining (all beach folk ran into the lagoon for cover) ..no place to even stand. But long after the rains stopped, the place was back to normal .. lots of food options all around. The waiting time can be a bit too long for food, so decide we'll in advance. Its annoying to see whole tables with all seats choped by a single tissue or an umbrella left on the table , while there are people carrying trays of food and not able to find a place to sit. The food choices and the sugarcane juice stalls make up for it 
The toilets as usual can be kept /used in a better way by people who visit. Its definitely a very good place to hang out with friends near the beach on a clear sky day ! "
"#01-23 fried carrot cake and oyster are both subpar, cooking is just anyhow, just for the quick buck. don't recommend patronizing."
Finding a table to eat is very difficult on the weekend evenings.
"One of my favourite hawker centres  Large variety of stalls/food to choose from, seating area is spacious, and relatively clean environment. Nice vibes being near the beach/sea and park. Seems to be a tourist attraction these days as I even saw tour bus picking tourists up from the entrance.

Tips for first-timers:
- Dress and carry light. While the area is well-ventilated, it is exposed to the elements, i.e. Singapore's hot and humid weather. That said, it doesn't mean in bikinis or topless , unless you want to stare at.
- Visit during off-peak hours. It can be very crowded on Friday and weekend evenings, so if you must visit on those days, try to come earlier than the usual dinner time. I prefer to not come earlier in the day as the sun can be crazy hot.
- Come in smaller groups. The tables are typically for up to 4 persons, so if your group is larger, it'll be more difficult to find an available table where you can all sit together.
- Carry cash. Unless you can use SG QR, the hawkers often do not accept other forms of cashless payments. Cash is accepted at every stall here.
- Find an available table first (and chope it, meaning have someone in your group sit there to reserve it) before you start ordering! This is typical of Singapore culture, so don't go lamenting why there are empty tables but you are walking around with food in your hands and nobody allows you to share the tables (you can ask the person first if you can share the table). Moreover, some hawkers will ask for your table number when ordering certain dishes here (the food will be delivered to your table).
- Hawker centres are fully self-service. Find your own table, order and serve your own food, and clean up your table/trays after. Bring your own tissues/napkins.

What to order:
I'd usually order about half being carb based dishes (e.g. fried Hokkien mee, duck rice, bak kut teh, fried carrot cake) [e.g. if there are 4 pax, 2 dishes would be carb based] and the rest would be sides (e.g. sambal stingray, satay, BBQ chicken wings, some veg). As for drinks, my go-to is sugarcane juice with added lemon  Tourists would probably be ordering a whole coconut or beer lol.

If you're eco conscious, you can bring your own cutlery as many stalls here uses disposable cutlery and plates even for dine-in orders "
Fair distance out of the Centre of Singapore but worth the trip if you like satay
"The place is very nice ,"
"If I go, definitely on Friday evenings."
"Alot of similar stall selling similar food, mostly seafood. Which is nice, I have no idea. But alot of ppl so have to hunt for seats.

Can consider Malay stalls, not bad also"
An open food court with lots of variety. Good food and drinks by the beach.
But some time diff to find plc tht y
The place can be very busy or packed during the weekend and on a holiday. Food varieties is good and taste depends on the stall you patronize. The only setbacks is the waiting time can be around 1 hour.
"Had Mutton/Chicken/Babat Satay for dinner ($13.50) on 26/4/23, was very good."
"Here you can find variety of local oriental food. Quite busy, noisy and hot"
"SEAFOOD IS THE WAY TO GO!!! Always a vibe coming here with family/friends. Things we always go for
Sambal Stingray, Salted Egg Chicken, Sambal Kangkong, Oyster Egg and a bowl of rice each.

Sides that everyone should get is the chicken and satay of all kind (beef, chicken, mutton)"
Quiet hawker centre with ocean views. I was there at lunchtime and 90% were closed with shutters up. No problem with getting a table and plenty of room for everyone to spread out. Tried the seafood options and prices were a dollar or two cheaper than the ones closer to the city. There's a new MRT line being built that would make it easier to get there by public transport in a few years time. For now taking the green MRT line to Bedok and a bus or a 30 minutes walk to get there.

"Nice  beachside hawkers center alhpugh can be hot in the early afternoon. The oyster omelette, pork satay  n popiah is nice ....but need to know which stall to go to. Forgot the name of the nicer ones."
Not good to much for comparer other places
"Really nice place with great selection of meals, recommend to visit.
Second time I visited on rush hour, was hard to find free table..."
Teochew style braised duck setting on beach with sea breezes!
Quite crowded during the weekends but food is superb! Particularly liked the fried oyster omelette from this store called Hougang Fried Oyster. Plenty of seats with shelter but may take a while to find vacant seats. Tried the seafood (hum) too and they were really fresh!
"Best braised Duck rice in Singapore, served with hospitality....Yummy "
Fei Chang Hao De Xiu Xian Yu Hao Mei Shi De Di Fang
"Great weekend family place, cycling by the beach followed by bbq dinner. Only downside is the crowd, hard to get seats during peak periods."
Seafood @here so yummieeee.... I Like it.... 
"Best dinning after office hours.
Always crowded but somehow manage to get place to sit... !!!"
Egg Oyster  and Satay Beehoon is not too salty and yummy 
"The wanton mee is good. Satay, many stores to choose from. Many good food to try."
Love this !!!! Long q
"Love the atmosphere at this place. Good food like pork rice, BBQ seafood and satays."
Nice place for a gathering. Can get quite crowded but food is good.
"Best halal BBQ chicken. 
Satay meat is big and nice."
"Filthy tables, chairs and floor. Small portions of food. Nothing great. I'd recommend a heartland coffee shop or a hawkers centre"
"Great choices of a variety of cuisine! Most tasty ones are the Satay, Beef Noodle Soup and any of the BBQ Seafood!"
I love every dish I have taste. I just forgot its name. It was my friend who ordered. But as what my friend said. The food here are mostly singaporean dish.
Always crowded with the famous stalls but never fail the standard. Actually most stalls taste good with similar food.
"Very nice local experience!  Food Food Food  Everything looks good and I wanted to try them all, but I couldn't . I recommend everything. Perfect place to have lunch and relax or go for a walk afterwards."
"A nice place to come with family.  Brought Mom and Dad here.  Not convenient for wheelchair traffic.   I have to navigate my Dad around to find the only flat path to the centre.  Signs were inadequate or obscured.

Rojak and 29 Geylang Prawn Mee is good."
Lots of local dishes with a beach ambience
"Tasty Bakut Teh & Ter Kah, mee goreng, lemon chicken rice, Thai cuisine and Hokkien mee "
"Nice vibes and good food, what more can you ask for"
Very nice satay and duck rice. Of course it's priced for tourist but still nice once in a while.
Gotta hit up one of the covered tables next to the satay place
Nice collection of local food. Can be very busy during peak hours especially over the weekend.
Local hawker delights
Nice to eat breakfast
Great place to get satay and beer!
If you want to enjoy sea view and seafood you must come
All time  favorite  roasted pork with char siew rice
"With a huge range of hawker stalls on offer, giving you every single option your heart could desire at low low prices, there is literally something for everyone or better yet, choose several options just for yourself.  Clean tables with undercover areas. Was one of the few hawker center where I could find my favourite black carrot cake and it was delicious!"
"Ziemlich cooles Hawker Center am Strand mit Blick auf die grossen Schiffe.
Naturlich gibt es hier Sea food und das in allen Variationen. Die Preise sind entsprechend hoch die Qualitat der Speisen aber auch. Wir waren hier ofters essen und immer zufrieden."
"Nice place for lunch, dinner or just an in-between meal or refreshments after a day out at the super big East Coast Park.

This is a typical Singapore hawker centre with all kinds of food of all races and culture. Cheap and good. There are some really famous stalls. So expect long queues.

Seatings are alfresco style with poolside umbrellas and permanent pergolas. Feel free to share tables as it can be really crowded.

Toilets are clean and airy. Paid parking can be a challenge. But free parking are generously available a nice coastal walk away.

Update:

Just went for lunch today. Very quiet. Probably because of school holidays with many Singaporeans enjoying their drive to Malaysia.

Update:

Went for lunch today. Again quite quiet. No idea why. Maybe the weather was really hot.

Had my favourite satay beehoon. Unfortunately, the serving had shrunk for the same price plate I ordered.

Also had my favourite fried carrot cake. Serving was the same. Tasted good. Especially with the chilli."
"Honestly, we bought the Malay chicken satays not so nice but finished "
"Visited this place on 30 Mar 2023 for dinner. Its always a great place of local dishes famous to foreigner as well as locals. Great seafoods with great variety of foods and stores to chose. Excellent for family, friends or foreign friends. "
Amazing place to grab very cheap very quick bite.
Delicious Satay!
"Shi Wu Hao Chi,Dan Shi Yue Lai Yue Gui. 
Wan Can Shi Jian Hen Nan Zhao Dao Zuo Wei. "
"Wide variety, good quality and fantastic ambience !
Finding a table can at times be hard during busy period, but patience usually pays off."
As usual always crowded on Saturday evening and longer waiting time even for takeaways. Can takeaway and eat it by the beach for another experience.
"Food court by the seaside with lively atmosphere. Some chiefs still need to learn about healthy cooking, sadly. Never had such sweet Mee Goreng."
Good loved it.
Breezey nice spot for      Beer
"Food Center just beside the beach . Price is fair , slightly more than normal hawker Center . A place where you can find many satay stalls . Very crowded on weekend nights. The hawker has other food such as wanton noodle , Hokkien prawn noodle, Hainanese chicken rice . After dinner you can have a stroll along the beach . Not advisable to swim at East Coast as the water are not clean ."
"The food is even better than some famous restaurant. Especially the BBQ Stingray at stall 16, I recommend everyone to go and try. Excellent food!"
Singapore famous FC. Lots of choices. Weekend always pack.
"A lot of choices but too crowded during weekend, queued 20 mins for table.   Long queue for good foods."
Awesome food and good vibes by the sea. All the hawker items we ordered were legit fresh and delicious. Beer with ice isn't all that bad in this weather as well 
Interesting experience. Not the most hygienic but fun to be in
"Exceptional variety of cuisines to ensure there's something for every palate,
And then, it's on the ECP, what more can one ask for"
"So many food stalls, most of them are very nice!"
"Hao Mai,Hao Guang,Fu Wu Hao"
"Very affordable price, convenient and relaxing."
Seafoods was nice. The surrounding area also great. Water parks and parks around the place was great. Come early to avoid crowd.
"Still the best satay in SG, imo."
"A hawker bustling with many food options, and a few duplicates. Look for the hokkien mee with yellow sign board, while their hokkien mee is not too bad, what's really commendable is the pork satay which is more like Thai mooping. For sugarcane lemon, recommend to go to the stall at the center."
"Great variety of local delicacies, especially seafood. An open-air hawker centre in the heart of East Coast Park, good for families, dates, or gatherings.
The charcoal hokkien mee is a must try, but beware of extra long wait time during peak hours."
Very yummy bbq seafood
Just had rojak and sugar cane. Was rather quiet. The place is quite pricy and people probably only come here when they go to the beach.
Need transportation to go there
"Chi Bao Ke Yi San Bu,Ta Jiao Che"
"Love the food, love the place, just love it"
Too good place for Non veg lover's.....you can have variety of non veg food including sea food
Great place cheap food...alot of seafood
Chinese drink store some charge 1.80 for a tea with milk. So check price before ordering.  Also chinese satay store like hougang satay and oyster eggs too much water but the oyster is generous and fresh. Satay stay away. Just too little meat.
food's still good. the lady at the soup stall makes very delicious stirfry kailan
"I cycled from MBS to East Coast Lagoon in the morning. Lucky to have some stalls open. We tried duck rice and century egg podridge, tasting both nice. Price is reasonable."
"Crowded on weekends, hard to get a seat."
Food is always great here..but parking is a major pain..and..there are not enough tables for masses that come here. Wish SG opened similar food court in the west!
"Can Dian Mian Fu Wu Fei,Mian Shui,Xuan Ze Xing Zhong Duo!Suan CPZhi Hen Gao De Di Fang,Zheng Zhuo Chi Liao Da Gai 160Xin Bi.1"
Crowded makan place. Find fun in finding place to sit.
"Food is very expensive.. taste is okay.
Lot of touting."
The foods here is 10 times better than newton...
Best place in singapore to have sea foods
Fantastic local food and a beautiful setting!
"Visited with my family - they have a lot of tables so it was easy for us to order our food and dine in on a weekday night. The sugarcane with lemon was our favourite! BBQ chicken wings, hokkien mee & satay we're good too. Many shops were selling similar dishes though - so we ordered mostly from the stalls that had a lot more customers waiting around."
Plenty of good food to eat here. For those driving try to come before 5pm on peak hours else you will have trouble finding parking lots as it tends to get crowded.
After Exercise Dinner... hahaha
"One of the hawker with better and wide variety of local food. Recommended to go earlier. Satay was just normal, sauce quite diluted. Sugar cane not bad."
V delicious satay and hokkien mee  Can get very crowded at night
Long wait on weekends
Very pack dangerous if covid spread there. 37&38 nice seafood
"Amazing variety of food available here!
We had Stingray from stall 4 which was amazing, and chicken wings from the lovely couple at stall 14. My son and I really enjoyed them "
The food is great but quite packed during the weekends. Nice to have breakfast on Sunday mornings
"An iconic local food haven, it offers one of the largest varieties of Singaporean cuisine. There are foods from Chinese, Malay, Indian and culturally mixed backgrounds.

If you're a tourist reading this review, please consider getting your fill of local delicacies at places like this instead of the overpriced fare at Makansutra and Chinatown. Plus, there's a huge park and Beach area nearby to explore after consuming all those calories!

Here's a few tips on what to order. Fellow Singaporeans can back me up on these recommendations:

Fire-roasted chicken wings
Oyster pancake fry (Orh Luak)
Sambal Stingray
Satay
Char Kuey Teow
Sugar Cane Juice (the best stall for this beverage is located along the Malay satay area)

For all the calories you consume, you can burn them all off by taking a walk/hire a bicycle to explore East Coast Beach. Hoorah!

I advise you to visit this place in the evening or at night, because the heat can get to sweltering levels when the sun is out."
"Overall still above average.. I can't remember which store I buy the satay, but is super nice, the satay sauce is thick.. Not the ones that Q so long..."
"Good food, many options of stalls. Though, a bit of a walk for many coming in via public transport. You sometimes will get people approaching you for donations or selling tissue."
Open air hawker. Had lunch so limited options.
Must visit place when in SG
Relax just at the beach.
For Non Vegetarian food lover...this the place to visit....
"This is a good place to have your bbq craving satisfy with friends, family, or colleagues. But need to take note of peak period as it will be fully occupied."
"I love the bbq chicken wings. $1.30 each. Crispy on the outside, tender and juicy inside. The stall owner is very friendly. Must eat or takeaway each time I'm here."
Food is excellent but you always have people waiting for you to leave in the weekend
Food on the way home from  Changi Airport. Not too crowded.
Went here on a Tuesday evening for our evening meal. A great place with plenty of stalls and every type of food imaginable. Tables are either open or under cover and offer great sea views. Food was quickly cooked and there are beer stalls to wash it down with. We travelled here by taxi and had no problem getting a taxi back to our hotel as they were arriving here every few minutes.  A great place to relax and chill out with locals and tourists alike.
Great sea food! Nice to get a walk on the beach after you finish...
Great hawker center by the shore. Would give 4.5 stars if possible. Chicken or duck rice are fantastic (I think roasted is better) and the bbq sambal stingray is delicious- I recommend you get the rice dish first and use the leftover rice for the stingray - couldn't be better.
"Many stalls selling the same things, quality probably varies widely, prices not so much."
The 1st stall that does drinks is good i recommended the sugarcane and lemon
A great food place close to the sea. It's a great place to go to after a day at the beach.
Variety of food shops. Plenty of choice and good choices make satisfying evening. Big problem is finding place to sit.
Do carefully when selecting the seafood stalls ..some stalls happened to cut corners in their servings ... Less meats or seafood replaced with great amount of onions/garnish/chilli ..very disappointed 
"A little far out and easier if drive there. But, great various food stalls for dinner with friends and families. After dinner take a walk enjoy the night scenery and fresh seaside air."
I absolutely love the duck noodles here at East Coast Lagoon! Be prepared to wait as the food preparation can be surprisingly slow. Be prepared to wait for at least 30mins (when you have 5-6 persons in the Q) as they also do takeaway phone orders.
"Nice food court. However can be crowded. There is plenty of options of all sorts of hawker food from Singapore. Satay is really good. I come here often. It is nicely located by the east coast park and sea.

Also bbq sambal stingray and oyster omelette dishes are good at some stalls. It's a nice food centre but a bit touristy and very busy."
"Loved the food! Had sambal stingray, satay, popiah, black and white carrot cake and washed that all done with sugarcane juice. Absolutely devine!"
"Always very crowded during weekends dinner.. be prepare to have a hard time finding table. but once you find a table, be prepared for great food choices!"
Always a thumbs up for satay and sugar cane juice. Best and cost effective place.
Weekdays is fantastic. Avoid weekends. Good variety of local food next to the beach. Windy and cooling.
Satay was succulent and juicy
Great pit stop during my cycling journey. Go-to meal is always the Yellow Sign board Stall that sells char kway teow. Uncle is incredibly friendly and cooks amazing kway teow. $6 serving can feed one hungry person or two not-so-hungry people. $8 serving can comfortably feed 2-3 people. Get the sugarcane drink too!
"Not a big fan of this place because it's too crowded and ain't a fan of East Asian cuisines. Satay was the prime attraction at this location, of course you have a lot of other options to explore. Maybe an early evening visit would be a recommendation from my experience, if you wanna enjoy the view and food. Fresh drinks are worth a try "

"The food was good & it's open concept facing near the beach so it's nice & cool, just have to be careful with unpredictable weather"
Lots of good food. Sunday early lunch wasn't crowded.
"Lots of selection of food.
Pricing of food is getting more expensive."
Amazing food and inexpensive beer.
Pas kesini lg weekend rame makanan ok lah..yg rame dsn sate dan chicken wing bbq nya..enaknya dsn ada danau n pantai jd bisa jalan2..dan water sport
Jia Ri Ren Chao Tai Duo Bu Yi Zhao Dao Zuo Wei Yong Can
Nice food and place.
Nice place for local food with many varieties of choice.
"It's a very crowded place,  food is expensive.  The only point is location,  just within  East Coast Park."
"Nice place for food.
Not  many healthy choices but good place for catching up"
"Great place to enjoy Hawker meals, including satay, with a view of the sea! Beers are cheap, food options are amazing. What more could you want?"
"Open air Hawker centre by the beach to experience local hawker cuisines.

Forgot name of stall , we got Oyster egg from an old  uncle , mind you this is the  egg  with loads of oyster , not the starchy omelette ( Or Jian)

Tried chicken wings fr Heng Heng BBQ,  minimum 3 pieces , marinated well and tasty when accompanied by Chili sauce .
The otah was surprisingly disappointing."
"Most of the food here are really yummy, price wise, it is still affordable - though slightly above average hawker food prices. Many satay stalls available, ordered at stall 55 - supposedly famous, only managed to order their chicken satay as they sold out of the other variations (during dinner time, around 7pm), tbh, taste wise, was nothing too special / worth the extra wait.

My usual go-tos are the carrot cake and wanton mee!"
Average at best but of a few places for satay and its be the beach so thats a plus if in the evening.
Average food experience. Crowded on weekends
"Tone of food here, specialty in satay and seafood.. don't forget to get sugar cane lemon! tasty!"
My go to place for seafood and satay. Please support stall 38. I always go to this stall. A friendly family run that stall. Food is awesome.
"Was here two days ago with my partner and unfortunately too many Halal stalls were closed so our options were very limited. Ordered vegetarian fried rice and fried bee hoon from the only Indian stall opened and it was so below average that I, as an Indian, was beyond disappointed. The vegetarian fried rice tasted like he just used Seri Aji's Veg Fried Rice seasoning and black pepper and voila, out to the customer it goes. Fried beehoon wasn't even served with cucumbers, and I asked to make it spicy but no red chillies were visible. Both dishes were so bland that my partner and I were struggling to finish it.

The satay from the next stall was the only saving grace."
Great food at reasonable prices
Mei Shi Shao Hai Bian San Bu Bu Cuo
Good hawker facing the seaside. A lot of seafood options.
Best place to have DUCK RICE. Call to order and collect later.
"It's a popular place every weekend. Lots of good food, but always busy.   Got to come early to get table, or wait."
Wide range and variety of food. The seafood was just awesome! Service was excellent! There too many seat hoggers though.  Was extremely crowded.
Waiting for seats are just bad..
"Nice food and atmosphere, but a bit too expensive"
Nice place to eat..but be careful where you buy your drinks because some are so overpriced...paid $3.50 for some small longan drink
"great food! sambal stingray, BBQ chicken wings and satays are a must at this place."
"Bbq seafood, chicken wing and satay is the best"
Only a few stalls operating when visited in the afternoon. Another under run hawker centre with a big capacity
"Nice eating place with seaside view and plenty of seats, and within walking distance to beach."
Favourite duck rice stall & rojak
"Huge variety of competing stalls offering local cuisine, great for group gatherings, outdoors and coast-side dining."
Wide selection of food
"Depends on which stall. Most of the food being delivered but for those self service, inconvenience if you have to sit far away. As for prawns, not fantastic here but will need to try different stalls."
"Just right by the beach, open air, more relaxed and nice vibes. Mostly satay stalls, but there are few other varieties as well. Plenty of hand washing stations and large toilet, which is appreciated."
Ove it here seafood paradise
"2 words to define. Singaporean cultures

Dinner time have more stalls available"
"Went there in the afternoon around 3pm, couldn't find stall selling coffee."
Love the food here

Lots of good memories . Really love this place since childhood time.
"This stall is pretty good, considering how pricey everything is now these days, their prices are aligned and quite generous on the servings to be honest."
Seating more than 6 dont have a more than 6 will abit part from the next table
"No fail still as good, just that many repeated stall like all claim they are famous
mee...overall still like the food."
Great place to eat while in East Coast Park
Very nice place to hangout with family..
Amazing choice of food!
"Nice seafood, fresh with reasonable price in Singapore, most of customer here are local"
"One of the best hawker centres in Singapore right now, not just because of its beautiful location and the generally great vibes, but the selection of hawker stores there and the food that's available is probably amongst the best qualitatively on the island. If you're looking for hawker stores in Singapore then you need to pay this place a visit!"
Love to go there but not on weekend. No parking lots available and you possibly not be entertained by any of the stall holder. Because TOO CROWDED
Not much of variety for lunch.
"Good place to unwind in weekends after a long week n hours of working.
Good for jogging, brisk walking n cycling. Also family outing.
The makan are very good n have many varieties from malay, Indian, Chinese food n etc.
Must go and try2 la as price is reasonable."
"DONNO IF THE BAMBOO CLAMS REAL OR FAKE , LOOK LIKE SOTONG PC TO ME LAH. N THE PLACE IS SO DARK. I CANT SEE PROPERLY."
Open air with good food
Amazing experience eating Chilli crab at Stall 38. Friendly auntie seller and super thick and fresh crab meat drenched in the tasty Chilli Crab Sauce.
"It's had been a while since I ate out. And this outing was a total disappointment. We ordered the usual fare of bbq sting ray, sambal squid, deep fried baby squid, when the food arrived I notice that the sambal squid was full of onions. On eating the deep fried baby squid, there was hard rubbery bits which I think was dried fish skins of sort which were hardly edible! And where's the crispy baby squid?. The sambal squid was also rubbery and hardly edible. The only edible item was probably the stingray and veggie dishes.

It was a waste of money, but more importantly re-enforced my view that it's best to stay home and have home cooked food."
"just to preface, i regular Lagoon Food Village - i think it's safe to say almost every singaporean has fond memories attached to Lagoon.

there's one store, at the corner of Lagoon, i'm afraid i did not manage to get the name of - but it's in between a drink stall and a satay/grilled chicken store and has an ORANGE/YELLOW coloured sign. the place is Halal.

please do NOT go there, the food is only sub-par, and the service is absolutely HORRIBLE.

i ordered their oyster omelette, but received an onion omelette instead. went there to get my actual order but was received with the cashier scolding me for not checking my receipt, saying things like ""did you eat this"" (when obviously i didn't) and things like ""so how are we supposed to sell this now"".

all i asked for was literally my actual order, which was the oyster omelette, and I was received with absolute rudeness and unnecessary raising of voices and yelling when it could have been simply been over in a mere 3 seconds by exchanging my order.

the cashier that took my order pinned the blame on me for not ""checking the receipt"" when i stated loudly and clearly that i ordered the OYSTER omelette and not the onion one. apparently i was the problem to him, and that my job of 'checking the receipt' was imperative to an entirely tiny problem that was made a big one.

the oyster omelette received in the end after much yelling tasted absolutely bad and inedible unfortunately.

so please, avoid this store. will leave updates as to the name of the store once i find it out. instead, please get your sambal stingray, omelette, and kangkong fix at the hundreds of other stores there that will give u both service and quality.

thank you!"
I like the food all awesome....
"Delicious and affordable food court, seafood lover must try! We ordered Xie Han which was so umami and tender, Tai Shi Chao Tong Cai was a big big portion and also flavourful, grilled chicken wings were very smoky and delicious, the satay were a bit too strong, the source was too sweet. The environment is also very comfortable and a lot of seats."
"Chill at Weekends, gathering and relax with family and friends such nice place ~ lots of food mix choice and can take a walk after dinner at walk way of beach "
Nice food nice place !
"There's a stall, Sa-tay which serves piping hot and freshly cooked Satay. Chicken and beef especially was memorable and delicious 

Service was also great, good place to be at 3pm where it's hardly crowded"
A must try on East Coast. This is Singapore food culture at its best.
A great hawker center where you can find great local food.
"Pang Xie Tai Mei Wei,Ji Chi Zan,Gan Zhe Zhi Tui Jian,Huan Hui Zai Lai"
Love the bbq chicken wings!
Best hawker foods in sg.
Always a lovely place to gather with friends and colleagues. Good variety and pleasant service
"Good spot, but sometimes too busy to be able to sit (eg Sunday evenings)."
Tai Chai Liao Shi Wu Sha Die He Ci Jian He Yun Tun Mian
"Great seafood! Lively atmosphere, also really nice to go for a walk after you finish here, along the beach, which is super clean and pleasant!"
"It's a good place, however if you're looking for a place to sit, try to come before 6pm if possible, because the crowds start to come in around 6pm. Food is decent, many stalls to choose from. But not all the food is fantastic if I'm being completely honest. If you're willing to wait, then some stalls are worth that wait"
"Mostly people come here for seafood, satay, grilled wings and beer. Ambiance is great for family and courtship. Buy food over to beach picnic is a common sight"
Food place located at the east of Singapore closer to the airport. Food choices and quality is good with outdoor seating. It is always crowded all times in the evening especially on weekends. Not well connected by the public transport but worth taking the pain to go there. Sometimes difficult to find a place to sit and satay sellers could be heard calling to invite you to try their food stall.
"Traer efectivo, aunque hay un cajero. Chilli crab y raya super recomendable. Muy rico!"
Careful asking to share a table with most locals. All of a sudden the virtual qty of friends increases.
Popiah and satay are super nice!!!
"Had the more pricier satays from the three in a row stalls. 90 cents a stick stall#54.  The chicken satay looks slightly pink, query tenderized++whereas the beef is non descript taste"
Food was very nice 
Enjoy and cleaned 
One of the best places for local seafood and delicacies.
Shi Wu Fei Chang Mei Wei Hai Feng Liang Liang
"Long time never come here for foods. Surprise to come on weekdays and it has nice foods around. I enjoyed these local foods... fried carrots cakes, cuttlefish satay bee hoon, Hokkien prawns mee and bee hoon and coconut juices!!!"
Very clean and located next to the east coast beach. It's a lot less busy than the hawker centres in central
Looove the place soo serene
"The vibe is great. Come early during weekends to avoid crowds. Rojak, satay, chicken wings, and barbecue seafood are must-tries! Best go with freshly squeezed sugarcane juice. And finish off with an ice-cream from the push cart.

Crowd: super crowded from 6.30pm onwards
Setting: sheltered and open air
Selection: lots of bbq and satay, many are repeated items, so pick the one with most recommended poster or queue
Price: reasonable, maybe $1-2 more expensive than regular hawker centres"
"Good food. Fast and friendly service. Reasonable prices and plenty of food options. Can get very busy and might have to wait to seat, but weekdays/weeknights are not too bad. Uber/Taxi is the best means of public transport to get there. You can enjoy the beach, biking or walking before or after eating at the east coast Lagoon food centre."
"We dropped by Monday evening and some of the more popular stalls were closed. This is one place whereby you'll still get servers roaming from table to table to take your orders. Everything is served with disposable plates & utensils (easily stacked and dumped into large trash bin) so there are no tray backlogs when clearing after meals. We ordered the popular Sambal BBQ Stingray & Sambal KangKong from Stingray Forever BBQ Seafood stall. Sadly, the standards have dropped. The stingray meat was dry and not tender, sambal chilli was dried out too. A far cry from the Sambal BBQ Stingray from Chomp Chomp Food Centre at Serangoon Gardens. We also ordered the popular Hokkien Mee & Fried Rice from Choon Hiang stall. The Hokkien Mee was flavorful (more towards the wet as compared to the dry style). The Fried Rice was super dry and tasteless (couldn't finish eating this dish). Overall, this meal was very disappointing."
Surprisingly food here is nice and affordable as compared to other hawkers with the sea breeze. Good place to relex and chill
Newer hawker centre with big fans over some tables. We tried stall 40 a couple of  times and really recommend their carrot cake (7$ for the half-half) and the char kway teow noodles (5$).
"Lovely place for meal besides the beach 
Satay, vadel, grilled seafood etc ..so much choices"
"Lots of good food stalls but difficult to get a table on weekends. Expect to stand in a long queue for most stalls or wait for at least 35mins or more for food to he served at your table.

Not a good place to go with big families. U can't eat together as u will have different members queueing for food elsewhere. Always have some snacks before going there for dinner."
Not a bad place to share a meal with locals.
"Aunty's solo fried kway teow quite nice, fried oyster  also nice, stingray nice, satay ok ok can eat."
A lot of choices and good satay
Very Nice place
Great place for dinner hut too many stalls selling same kind of foods and I think it's too much competitive.
Well organised for court by the sea
"Have very authentic atmosphere. Can feel very singapore  local. But, better to avoid on weekend evening. Toooo full of people, no where to seat."
Yummy dinner. Food from these stalls.
"My local friend took me to this food village and I still visit here several times after that. There are so many food stalls for you to choose with variety of local food. I love having seafood here. Oh, also a lot of dessert for you to try as well!"
Nice n quiet.
"Very difficult to find seats & when it rains,no cover.."
"Wide varieties of foods including Chinese, Indian and Muslims but not vegetarian."
One of my fave places for dinner and drinks that's by the beach.
The 'Go-To-Place' for Satay and barbeque chicken! Not forgetting sugarcane lemon!!
Always great food.  Never disappoint.
It's East coast I like it
My choice of place for satay fix.
"This is a food heaven. Fried food, seafood, Malay dishes or Chinese dishes. All is available.

Enjoy good food with good company. Once done with dinner, can take a stroll along East Coast Beach and enjoy the sea breeze."
Had lunch but few opened
Somehow many stalls no sugar cane juice.
"Great food, good environment "
"Always crowded, if there is no queue, don't buy. Authentic lemon slice for sugar cane with lemon."
Recommended food stall is duck rice stall.
Ge Shi Xin Jia Po Mei Shi Guang Chang
Many food options to choose from. But could be really warm during the day and avoid seated near to satay stalls due to the smoke.
"Standards have drop since precovid, probably due to inflation and the use of cheaper ingredients.
Food taste like s***, fresh coconut is sour af and the egg omelette is all corn flour. Portion size is rather small even for medium servings; a tip of advice would be to just order small because medium and large ain't worth.
Most stalls are closed during lunch even on the weekends. Sadly, most good stalls are closed.
There are better hawkers out in the east.
Some stalls here are just to rip off tourist money. beware. ratings were prolly boosted by other good stalls."
Great place for a relaxing meal in close proximity to the sea
"Always loved this place for the wonderful selection of bbq seafood and satay.And of course all the local favourites like hokkien prawn mee,char kway teow."
Week nights are a better time as it is not over crowded. Hawker fare foods. Always loved ECP hawker 
"Iconic place for good outdoor food near the beach, on a good day it's so vibrant, sunny, breezy and a great place to hang out in the weekend with friends or family. The sambal stingray, bbq wings and stay is one of the best in Sg, many other dishes , add a cane juice and beer for a perfect meal!"
"We visited on a Tuesday. Not much was open and a bird sat above us and then pooed on my husband's noodles. Other than that, food was nice and you can grab a beer. Toilets and sinks for cleaning up. Good stop when cycling along East Coast Park."
"Good food, open seating alfresco and sheltered option. Prefer to eat early here to avoid crowd."
Exceptionally crowded when we went there for dinner on Saturday. But the Satay was good. Had mutton soup and nasi goreng too. Mutton soup had lots of meat in it. The Indian nasi goreng also had meat - which is pretty rare thing nowadays.
Great place by the sea to hang out with friends for local food & drinks. It can get a very busy so allocate enough time and have a game plan in terms of finding a table and lining up for food.

Bought food and ate at the east coast beach. So fresh to be chilling with friends in the evening.
one of my go-to food centre that serves a variety of options. decently priced w plenty of seating area. located right by the east coast which is a great place to hang after a long day out at the beach. love the geylang charcoal fried hokkien mee btw!
Went for an early dinner Saturday. Lovely hawker by the beach with variety of food. Love the carrot cakes from Lagoon Carrot Cake (blue signboard)!
"We had sotong, prawns, fish, oyster omelet and veggie for the 3 of us. Altogether $64.00. Taste is there. But the stingray was thin without much meat. Prawns were skinny. Sotong and omelet were good."
"So crowd. Not easy to find a table to sit.
But they have great view."
"Have variety choices of local food. Satay, bbq chicken wing, bbq sting Ray fish, rojak, fried sotong noodle and wonton noodle are good"
Awesome food options. Easy to get to via taxi $15. Food options are amazing.
"What a great variety of food, so delicious and so affordable"
"Singapore chilli crab and buns, Best value and taste with deep fried buns, to die for!"
"food is nice, me and wife love dining here after can walk around ( Beach )"
Nice place for dinner
The variety is amazing! Enjoyed the food there!
Spoilt for choices
Crowded especially during evening weekends.
The food ain't as awesome as it used to be. The cleanliness could have been much better.
I like this dating place. Good vibes and fresh cooked foods
Food is good but diificult to find seats especially during the weekends.  Most ppl are willing to share tables.
All time favourites 
Awesome spread of food. But do ask for price before ordering. Especially the seafood stalls.
Spoilt for choices.. so many delicious food
"You should go here. Great place to check off a bunch of must try dishes. Recomend satays of all varieties, BBQ chicken wings, and chili crab."
Alot of choices of food
Great Seafood and Satay!!!
"This is the most environmentally unfriendly hawkers center in Singapore. Apart from being more pricey than the regular heartland hawker centers, almost every stall uses Styrofoam disposables, which are prone to be flying saucers when the wind is strong.

Pros:
1. Unique selling proposition : Probably the only hawker center in SG with close proximity to the beach.
2. A wide array of stalls

Cons:
1. Expensive. Everything, including drinks is priced at least 30% more than the regular hawker centers.
2. Environmentally friendly
3. Super long waiting times during peak periods.
4. Inaccessible by public transport.....caters to those who drive that jammed up the carpark.
5. Breakfast is non-existent. Lunch is very limited. Only becomes alive during dinner time."
"Still as good as last time after COVID period..
Varieties of stall and places to choose.
Price wise still affordable and can chilled and relax with friend and family.
Order some stall foods I miss them so much :)"
Went there abt 8.30pm wanting to eat satay at stall 60 but they were closed so settle for stall 59. Had lamb and babat (stomach) satay. The lamb satay was too sweet and not tender. I think they over marinate it. The babat was soft abit under cooked. Sauce was also too sweet and too many chunky peanuts.
There's alot of kind of foods U can eats.
"Clean, great food, by the sea, no better way to have good local food and enjoy the sunny island."
"Note: To arrive at least an hour earlier to get a table. Busy hour starts from 6.30pm and it gets super crowded and impossible to get tables.

A great dinner and hangout place for all Singaporeans and expats or tourists alike. With reasonable prices, huge selection of local cuisine and even a beer garden and dessert store, theres really nothing you can't find here and it has always been my absolute favourite dining place.

The best dishes are the bbq chicken wing, bbq stingray, and most seafood selection are just yums. Dont forget to try the rojak and satay too!"
Nice place by the beach but wish they had more vegetarian options
Duo Mei Shi
Lots of varieties of food. Choose to eat satay and the honey chicken wings and drummet
Nice grilled chicken wings for $1.40
"If you don't mind the satay smoke, local food is usually good to share."
"Visited the food village/hawker centre for snack. Although the hawker centre is relatively in the open-air, it has shelters in case of rain or intense heat. For indoors seating, some areas have ceiling fans too! Some of the seating areas also have a good view of the beach and the sea!
There are many options for local delights such as the oyster omelette.
There are also satay stalls and stalls selling barbecued seafood items. This is definitely one of the more unique hawker centres!"
My favourite hangout when I need to get away from the hustle and bustle of Singapore
"An unchanged sight from days of yore, East Coast Lagoon Food Village remains one of the older Food Centre when it was still around and has been a staple for finding great food and even better sources to fill your stomach. The parking's really bad though, so I'll really recommend to change your parking spots to one that's further removed or displaced further up the road."
Delicious satay & tasty BBQ chicken wings
Good place to eat while at East Coast Park Beach!
"Good food at reasonable prices. Had a very nice dinner of bbq stingray, cockles, stir fried water spinach, thai chili chicken, satay and bbq chicken"
"So many yummy local food here.  If you have guest from overseas, bring them here.  You will solve all your problem to bring them aroubd Singapore to try our local food. "
"Been coming here since the early 80s. The food, the beach, the best."
"Lotsa of interesting choices here at hawker centre. The hawker centre has a wide range of local food including charcoal grilled satay, chicken rice, popiah, satay bee Hoon, fried hokkien Mee and roasted char siew. We tried the satay beehoon and it was unusually nice. It has some unusual ingredients such as lala, liver and a nice dose of sauce. Definitely amongst one of the best I have eaten in Singapore. We did not try the rest but would be back for more! It is along east coast parkway which is connected to Changi airport via a PCN or you can simply drive there to satisfy your craving for local fare by the beach! Ample parking though expect crowds on weekends!
."
Always my favourite but prices had increased
"Nothing suitable for vegetarian, except cane juice, coconut juice, tea/coffee or other drinks."
"Best chill out place in a local Singaporean setting! Come, to soak in the experience of local culture."
"Nice place for local food, usually crowded during dinner time and weekends. Most of the food was nice although the price are getting more expensive. Most Singaporean know this place. The only downside, not so direct if traveling via public transport."
Nice food. Reasonable price shared among 5 adults with each paying 17.40 and get to enjoy a variety of food we ordered.
"A place that the locals are familiar with a nice and fresh seafood, satay, barbecue etc...."
Very crowded. But there are plenty of food  options.
Great food selection. Options for everyone and a great meeting place with friends. Steps away from the beach as well
Go to place for good satay!
Only Hawker spot by the sea front in SG
"Great place for alfresco dining. Great place to get your barbecue seafood craving and satay craving fixed! I find myself trying food from different stalls each time I visit as there's so many choices. However getting seats require some patience especially on weekends and evenings.

Some stuff we regularly go for are the barbecue chicken wings, fried oyster omelette, satay and grilled seafood"
"Great value, and one of the Top 10 Hawkers Markets in SG"
"Good selection of food along with bbq skewers, finish off with a walk on the beach"
"1. Variety of East Asian, South East Asian, middle eastern & western choices of food available here.
2. Order, Pick & Eat is the way to eat here.
3. Superb place to hangout, exercise, eat, walk, enjoy the nature.
4. Specialties around here are
Indonesian food
Malaysian food
Singaporean local food
Exotic fruits & Ice creams
By the beach
Variety of hawkers to choose your food from
5. Absolute visit & I strongly recommend it.
6. Multi variety available for non-vegetarian choice."
"Always satay is best at ECP village. And nice chill out place.
How to reach ecp on public transport.
Goto Bedok interchange and take 401 bus. Note : 401 bus service available on Friday, weekend and public holidays only"
Sunday Night Dinner / Supper hangout
Good public refreshment area!!!!
Very very crowded on Saturday night. Certain place can be very smoky too because too much bbq in place. Famous store need to queue up to 45 min so we gave it a misses. We tried the Thai food which is not bad to say the least.
"Evening walk n have some favourite foods: BBQ chicken wing, fried osyter and poh pian."
great !!  you can eat fast and tasty.
"My family's been hanging out almost every week in East Coast Park to eat our lunch. The food options are fantastic and the price are very reasonable. I would very much recommend this place also to bike around the huge park and just enjoy the windy, sea scenery.

Totally one of the best spot in Singapore "
It was a rainy day but still enjoyed it here.
Great selection by the water! And next to the waterski park!
Great BBQ stingray
Enjoying seafood and satay by the beach. Best to come day time or weekdays. More seats and less crowd :)
"The array of tasty food at affordable prices at the beach, what more can you want!"
"Good place to spend time with loved ones
Amazing food and friendly vendors"
"Great end to a stroll through East Coast Park with plenty of food options all in the open air (with extensive gazebos to protect against both the sun and downpours).

Some awesome options include chicken  wings (if the queue at Ah Hwee is too long, try the one 3 stalls to the left, for equally good fare) and the popiah at Lagoon Famous Carrot Cake (spicy is better than non-spicy). There aren't any awful experiences so don't be put off from trying something else.

The only downside is the newly installed fencing at the point where the centre meets the path resulting in a loss of sea breeze, but if you never had it, ain't nothing lost."
"I always come here for the Hwa Kee Barbeque pork noodle. Their fried wanton is a must try. However, there is a fried oyster stall here which I boycott as the uncle is extremely rude and behave as though I can't afford to eat his stuff. His stall is Teck Oyster."
East Coast Food Village is a huge place offering all sorts of Sea foods and non-veg items at a throw away price. Good taste.
Perpetuates the traditions of this renown and traditional eating spot
"Breeze place for dinner,  nice selection of food"
heng heng satay stall omg its superb quality  satay and chicken wings. their chicken wing is bbq on the spot and not those heat up kind u find at sgn gardens
Great place to hang out...
Great selection of local delights but the best are the BBQ seafood and satay. Very airy and spacious and offers the sea view while you enough your food.
Huge variety of food vendors to choose from
Want to eat satay? Come here.
"Great place to ""fill your boots"" in East Coast Park. Love the satay, oyster omelette, chicken wings and bbq stingray. Found the chilli crab disappointing
Not so busy this evening - 19aug2022 - but oyster omelette was fantastic, if a bit pricey......"
Loved the variety of food as always.
I did it mistakely
nice place to eat
"Fabulous choices of truly Singaporean local favorite food. Popular among both tourists and locals. Pricies are local and not tourisy. Many stalls here are famous for their dishes, a great place to feast and drink beer together with a couple of friends."
"Some joker fenced up the part facing the sea n planted huge thick bushes.
Understand the fence to prevent kids from running onto the cycling path (it happens pretty much every where else at ecp anyways)

But the bushes block the sea breeze!! "
Good food must share!
Tersedia berbagai menu masakan yang enak dan lezat
"Still crowded at 9.30pm!
East coast park is just nearby, plenty of sporting activities to do before or after meal! Wonderful views of ocean along the East Coast shoreline.  Very good experience!"
Fantastic oyster omelette and BBQ Wings from the two stalls which open for lunch.
Satay the size of my thumbs.. worth or to die for...
Cooling day with yummy food..
"A veri nice , relaxing chill hawker with beer garden ."
So many varieties of cuisines
Went there for a walk n had a lovely coconut drink fr my usual drink store. The owner of the stall whom i always patronise bec of the v hot weather today gave me a drink saying it is too hot pl have tis on the housr . What a lovely gesture he is such a lovely elderly man. VERY hard to find such a giving man.
"Good vibes, good choices of food."
Dong Hai An Bi Qu
This  food village has different kind of Asian cuisines and has a wide dining space suitable for everyone.
Amazing! I had the stingray and wish I could go back there for some more.
Too crowded both dining area and carpark.
"Food Variety: 
Food Taste: 
Waiting Time: 
Seats: 
Price: 
Payment: Cash, Paynow or Scan & Pay

Improvements:
Some of the seats are meant for small groups and some trees should be removed. Causes inconvenience with the bird poop."
Always loved this place even though food is so so and costly. Not enough tables outside the food center for folks with dogs.
Lot of foods to  choose in the evening. Morning not the place to go
Duck rice stall was closed the last 3 times I checked. Others p good.
"Gave it a 1 star only from a vegetarian perspective. There is literally not a single shop that serves just about anything vegetarian... Perhaps this is what to be expected from a beach side food court, wish it was more veggie friendly:(... Until then I'll just live on sugarcane juice and iced lemon tea"
Nice local food.
"Very nice food and reasonable prices , you need to try auntie's prawn me it's simply magical"
"The hawker center is mostly outdoors, not too warm or humid. However, the foods served here are mostly below average. Only handful of stalls that are recommendable."
Delicious bbq chicken wings (chong pang huat!!) and sambal stingray
"Will be difficult to find a place after 5pm esp Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Food is good for most of the stalls. Great place to chill and have some beer, but dun drink and drive. Not so kids friendly unless mobile or tablet is available."
Plenty of choices and fair price
Try the local satay 
Not much of food options except barbeque
"Shop owners opens whenever they like, stores/place looks half closed all the time. But good food all around if you're lucky, life's a gamba if you decide to go here."
Worst dining experience today. Simple said will not come here on Saturday night. Drinks stall over charge while satay took 30min-1hour.
The best Stingray Forever at #01-43
"this was Saturday night.  so it was A LOT of people.  We took Grab to get here so didn't have to deal with park.  A lot of people hanging around the parking gate entrance area.

Once inside, A LOT of vendor selection, it was nice.  However, the person i was visiting with does not eat seafood, so our options were VERY limited.  But we were really just there to checkout the place as we have had dinner already.  I did try the stinray as I've never had it before.  but boy, it was WAY to salty, but it was fresh and portion was very generous.  $18 SGD

would come with an empty stomach next time and try out more stuff.

One thing to note, you want to get a table first and get the table number.  Once you order your food, give them your table number and they'll bring the food to you.  But bus your own table after.  overall, place is very clean and great selection.

I'll be back!"
Almost nearest 'Kampung' feeling...the Satay Club during the 90s...food is always localisedly nice...from Satay to Seafood to Indian Mamak style...a tower of alcoholic drinks also available...
Nice satay and place
"Large variety of food choices and food was nice too. However it is very hard to get a table, if you are visiting with a larger party, you won't be allowed to add chairs so you'll need to wait for a larger table with more seats. Might have to wait for up to 30min for a table!"
"Food standard varies as lots of different outlet offering the same type of items. You have to specifically select or choose the one that you are comfortable with. However, the outlets that are still open, generally are those that were always popular in their own ways that allows them to get through tough time. Different variety of items can be ordered, and price wise can be quite expensive if you happen to over order with an empty stomach  nevertheless, is ok once in a while to go with families and friends."
"Dinner with my TP classmates. Nice food nice ambience, A long get together since our graduation in 2019"
Food standard has gone down. The place is always crowded and place full of smoke from the grilling of the satay. Food is bad. Both satay and chicken wings are burnt. Stingray is over cooked. Very bad experience there
Was good. Dirty but the food there was good.  Must have the satay
"Good place to have some refreshments such as hawker foods or drinks after your exercise, walk, jog, run or stroll. There are also ample rest rooms."
Very crowded at lunch and dinner timings. Satays from the malay stall are delicious (tho can be slightly more charred).
"Great ambience and food for a night's out! Sells the best fried carrot cake here with other hawkerfare spread that will leave you spoilt for choice!
Do note prices are on the slightly higher side compared to usual hawker prices due to location and crowd."
"If you love seafood, satays and a combination of hawker food with the best ambience by the sea, this is the best place to be"
Great hawker experience with lots of great food for sharing!!
Food is OK but the price is not cheap at such location.
There is litterally nothing for vegeterian/ vegan.
"Is super peaked during weekends from 5 to 8pm.
Wide range of food to choose from
Satay, seafood, wanton mee, chicken rice etc.

Head there for supper, lesser option , so we had just wings and satay.

Carpark is rather packed and the entrance is always jam"
"Gotta have their satay at the red middle stall. Corner charcoal Hokkien mee, drinks are a all rounder and zhi char is simply a must! Carpark and seats is at your own risk crowded Max!"
"Very popular place to eat. Will be very crowded from 6.30pm onwards. Satay was nice, but the hokkien mee was quite disappointing. Didn't taste like hokkien mee."
"Always a good place for good food! But weekend is always very packed !
Had stingray, baby kailan. carrot cake, hokkien Mee, chicken wing , satay and wanton noodle!"
"The are a large variety of hawker fare to choose from. I especially liked the satay, oyster omelette, beef kuey tiao, BBQ seafood and the freshly grind sugarcane juice 
It can be very crowded on weekends during meal hours, so prepare to Q for your food "
"Been going ECLFV over the years. Went there recently and was deeply disappointed with the quality of food. Its utter trash right now. Only the Stingray Bbq was decent.. wasnt great.. just decent. The Satays, fried rice and chicken wings were bland and tastless. Never seen carrots and beans on a Hotplate Beancurd before , was bad. Hokkien mee was a disaster. Felt like the hawkers were trying to deter us to travel to JB for better food. Never going back again."
"You Zai De Chi Fan He Jiu De Di Fang,Jie Qian Da Zhong Hua. Zhi Shi You Shi Hou Ren Yong Ji Liao Yi Dian. Zhi De Chang Lai!"
Blue lagoon beef noodles soup is very good and perfect.
Order by mistake.if you wanna eat satay only order at harun satay for its soft and tasty satay.i ordered at diff shop and the satay is hard.
"Standard really went down, used to visit more regularly many years ago."
"Very poor human amenities. No toilet roll, how to clean,use what?

No bidet water tap for Muslims how?. How to clean up?

Have to go to drink stall get a empty cup to do your thing.

With that crowd size during week ends, Toilets look limited. Not with those patronising, Even large group of cyclists hog the toilets, Passing by motorists drop by, Passing by beachgoers, People who camp nearby as though they have no homes also use the toilets All have to queue.

Renovated the hawker centre but very poor toilet management.

Planners during renovation, and all never take this into factor is it?"
Nice place to eat.
All the shops fighting to get customers only but non have nice satay either never cook properly or over burnt on the outside ans raw on the inside but they have nice sugar cane juice and sea side breeze.
A lot of people eating during weekends. Foods are nice at Stingray Forever BBQ Seafood. I love the stingray and spicy kangkong. You may try them also if you visit their place.
Food use to be good here.Now it just clears the so-so range. Getting pricey too.
My favourite spot for bbq chicken wings and bbq stingray.
Went there for dinner over the weekend the malay satays and bbq stingray taste good. But to avoid crowds u have to go at odd hours.
Good food and a variety of different local delicacies in one place. Price is also reasonable and the ambience is just by the beach.
Wide variety of Chinese food.
Have many varieties foods.taste good.
Great selection of food and actually a nice place to stroll around too.
Definitely best place to visit after cycling or jogging. Full varieties of local food - Fried Hokkien Mee (recommended) and Fried Oyster.
The place is still great. Haven have these food for quite a while. Accessibility will be an issue for those that don't drive but this is at ECP. You shld be cycling/running/camping here
Nice place. Variety of food.
Bu Cuo De Mei Shi Guang Chang Zhu Yao Shi Hai Xian Wei Zhu Jie Ge Hui Bi Pu Tong Mei Shi Guang Chang Gui Yi Dian

Nice place for weekend dinners!
Nice food options

Nice place to stop during a ride
Great great food!
A lot of delicious seafood BBQ and drink with reasonable price
nice place stall owner friendly
"Hawker food paradise. Famous wanton mee, Hokkien mee, BBQ seafood, huge sugar cane water. A great way to eat and share local delights with friends."
One of the better hawker centers for food! Lots of choices. Some stalls been there for ages. Some stand out stalls too!
Super crowded on weekend
Food was ok but too crowded on the weekends
Just way too expensive. $8 for a mid-fried carrot cake (black/white) just enough for an adult.
Nice place for family outing.
Nice place to eat local food. Night time more stalls open and more variety.
"The place is good, suitable for stopping to quench your thirst or eat"
Good satay. Affordable food. A bit pricey tho.
"For the price the food not so shiok. Chicken is dry, not much flavour. Once in a while ok la."
Nice place to enjoy some hawker fares.
"The only hawker centre (food centre) that you could admire the sea view while enjoying your local delights.
Wide variety of local food available. Do note that during evening times, there would be more stalls opened. There were quite limited stores opened during the lunch time.
Ample choice of seating available. You could opt for the sheltered seats if the weather was hot or the open area seats, where you could enjoy the sun.
Strongly recommended!!!"
Pin Chang Mei Shi Hao Qu Bi. 
Would say a lot of food stalls are selling repeated dishes. So just try different stalls when you visit.i personally like hougang carrot cake and the seafood stall next to it
Haron satay never disappoint me..
More stalls open at evening night
Best beach side hawker centre.
yummy satay
Good for atmosphere. Food soso
Forever seafood 
"Yummy food stalls, cozy place to hang out with friends and family."
"Satay beehoon - rice vermicelli drench with fragrantly creamy peanut gravy, cockles, cuttlefish, slice pork, taupok and kangkong."
"The bbq chicken wing & bbq stingray with chilli are one of the best in Singapore.
This hawker food rather clean and have a good atmosphere for family & friend eating together.
Best time to go and eat there around 3 pm to 7 pm where not so crowded and easier to get seats."
Really nice nasi lemak! Would come back again!
"Didn't expect the food here to taste so fresh and delicious, definitely over our expectation.

Price wise, cheaper than nearby restaurants but more expensive than other heartland hawkers

Parking and getting seats required patience on weekends. Expect 30mins to an hour.

If you love crowds, this is the place, it's packed!"
Nice delicious food
Crowded places with nice foods
"Satay was delicious, Mee goreng is not that good, other dishes not bad and lucky we get a table this time."
"Lots of variety of Singapore local food. Great place to bring tourist friends over to! Love the hokkien noodles, satay and BBQ stingray"
Good variety of food and also a good view of the park while eating. Downsides are that it is as expected to be more pricey and the exposure to weather conditions since it is open concept.
You can get a range of satay and seafood stall in these food village.
"Perfectly grilled chicken wings, Sambal Sotong (Squid cooked in chilli paste/sauce) and Fried prawn pancake paired with a cold glass of beer? All day everyday! Our love for hawker food is second to none and this food centre is one of our faves."
During the wk end it was super crowded you need to wait for a while before finding a seat/table.
Nice food found here. Reasonable price too. Not forgetting new look after Reno.
Great varities but best to take out dur to weather and the crowd.
Great food and great place to chill with friends.
It's the best.

Convenient food store! Reasonable price! Satay taste really nice.
Love the food. Good for family activities
"Great variety of food. Slightly overprice.
Minutes walk away from the beach"
"Delicious Bbq Stingray, Fried Kway Teow and Bbq Satay. Lots more delicious local food "
WAHH. The food there is delicious and the stall owners are really helpful and kind. They are always happy and barely get agitated. The food there is affordable and delicious. It gets quite crowded which tells that it is good. However the toilet is bad
"Located right by East Coast Park - perfect for a post-meal stroll. Most stores were selling the same things - zichar, grill, seafood, sugarcane. Very spacious tables, managed to find seats during dinnertime.

Ordered black carrot cake $5 and hokkien mee $8 from the same store because there's a long queue (so we assumed it's good, and it was haha). Also ordered a small stingray and white rice for $13."
My best place for Rojak and sugar cane after cycling
"Nice place to chill after a long day at the beach. Indulge in local food , u will b spoilt for choices"
"A myriad of food choices, satay good"
Great food as always and at affordable rates.
"Hao Chi De Shi Wu,Huan You Xian Chang Ge Shou Zhu Chang"
The food over there was very nice and so many peopple sometime no place the be sit but must be patient you guys have to look the place to be sit enjoy the meal over there.
My must visit place in Singapore. But it's difficult to find a parking lot on weekends.
Lots of local food. Great place for expats and tourist living in the east to gather for great food.
"The East Coast Lagoon Food Village has quite a number of hawker stalls that serve really delicious food. Ranging from bbq stingrays, bbq chicken wings, fried prawn noodles and of course the braised pork knuckles and Rou Gu Cha.

My family like the braised pork knuckles served by Han Jia Ba Kuah Teh very much. There are two types of braised pork knuckles served by this stall. The more fatty braised pork knuckles and the lean braised pork knuckles. We prefer the lean braised pork knuckles. Its well marinated, the meat of the pork knuckles is soft, juicy and lean. It really goes very well with the white rice. And of course, if you are someone who prefers spicy sauce, you can asked the stall owner for their specially prepared, spicy chilli sauce.

Of course like the name of the stall suggests, they served Rou Gu Cha. There's also a dried version of the pork ribs. But I personally find that the dried version of the pork ribs is too dry and without much sauce compared to the other hawker stalls that sell dried pork ribs. Unlike their braised pork knuckles, their dried pork ribs may not be tender and juicy enough at times. So there's still room for improvement.

There always seem to have very different stall holders who work in this stall. Most are friendly and too ""service-oriented"" I would say.

There have been a number of times when I actually saw customers who patronise this stall for Rou Gu Cha going back to the stall again with their used bowls and asking for a refill of the soup. And whoever is working at the stall during that time will always readily took the used bowl from the customer and refill it up with additional soup!!!

I certainly feel that this particular stall must take this view of  unhygienic practice very seriously!!! No matter how friendly they choose to be with their customers, they certainly must STOP THE PRACTICE OF REFILLING THE USED BOWLS WITH SOUP FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS!!!

If the stall owners want to be friendly with their customers, they can actually use a clean bowl, refill up with the soup for their customers."
Always crowded
"Some food very good, but not all , muslim food very expensive, and not nice"
"Always nice to sit and watch the sea. Salted egg prawn, bee hoon and satay my absolute favourite."
Very vibrant hawker market
Nice place
Wanton noodles
All the good foods and not crowded in the afternoon.
"Good and reasonably cheap food,outdoor seating.

Nice place to eat."
Too crowded....lack of seats
Super delicious Wanton Noodles.
"Favourite hawker centre of mine.
Great selection of local hawker fare, al fresco seating and one can go to beach for a leisure walk after your meal.

Time your visit properly as it can get quite crowded during dinnertime in the weekends."
"I love this hawker centre - good food at affordable prices.

Parking however is a nightmare; same with getting a table"
Best place for supper 
"Do not order from huat huat barbecue seafood!! Food portion is pathetically little. Ordered the stingray which was not fresh and overcooked. I only manage to consume 20% of the cockles as most of them are either uncooked, full of sand or super salty"

...good food...lots a lots of ppl especially during weekends..hot and stuffy...mindless bicycle riders..good food..big carpark..did I say good food already?...
Nice place
Foooods are good 
"Parking is horrendous as usual on a weekend, suggest to park elsewhere or arrive in alternate forms of transportation. Tables are cleaned efficiently and available seating is now more dependent on luck after the relaxed restrictions. You'll also find the familiar touting returning.

Pro tip: If you want tasty dishes, be prepared to wait in the long queues and not give in to persuasion. Some good stalls close early because they are sold out, so check their opening hours online and come early if possible."
Good place to chill out by the beach with no extra cost.  Setbacks is the so-called touting by some of the stallholders. Seafood is on the high side.  Other than tt nice place.
Plenty of good food options
Great food during cycling break
Place where all taste of Thi food available with good taste.
Fried oyster is nice here.
Love the satay here
Nice sambal stingray and Sotong
"Very crowded on weekends, public holidays and pre public holidays."
Food is so so
"The food was not tasty, oily and expensive. The centralized drink store charged premium for  sugar cane without ice but loaded 1/3 the cup with ice....
Stingray was not fresh and the chilli was not tasty, better of eating at the residential places where it it less expensive,fresh and tasty."
"Fantastic seafood choices, went on a close-to-supper time, not much of a crowd, average prices and great food."
Beachfront food center with diverse choices of good local food. Probably the best choice for first-time visitors to Singapore looking to try a taste of the local cuisine.
Only few stalls operating for lunch.
Superb seafood shops . Dwelled and immersed in the taste of sambal sting ray fry and satays .
Lots of food with fair price and nice taste. Good place for food lovers.
Good place
relaxing place
Went for a BBQ seafood feast. The stall owner was friendly and offer extra free rice  food is great and sugarcane with plum power 
"Food portions here are gargantuan for some reason. The hawkers are generous, the drinks are huge, coconuts are huge, duck rice is huge."
Good place for eat and drink
Satay was really good. Seafood was so so only tho
"Every stall serves the same stir fried food, noodles and bbq seafood.  Didn't enjoy the food there."
"It's a hawker centre, beer garden and satay club by the sea. Get your fix of delicious chicken wings, satay, stingray, oyster omelettes, and lots of barbecued and fried foods by the sea. One of the best place to chill out, with all the best local food in one place."
Very nice chicken wings.
"Great char kuay teow, great wings and great satay.

Hard to get to if you don't drive though."
Open air alfresco dining at hawker centre prices. Ease of parking.
"Situated along the East Coast cycling route, a very convenient eating place after a long ride either from the east or the west. Sugar cane juice with lime is superb. Hokkien Mee and Carrot Cakes are nice too."
Food is not bad. Better than Newton Circus... Some stalls are better than others. Wanton mee / porridge in corner shop is very good
"This is one of the nicer Hawker centres in Singapore with a great variety of local food. If you are a foodie this place is a must visit for the sheer number of stalls and good food.

Generally the food from most stalls is good to taste and priced fairly.  Getting a table though may not be as easy.

Access to this Hawker Centre is a bit of a pain if you are not driving.  Regular public transport is a 5 to 7 min walk.

Taxis are a problem during peak hours. If you drive,  you will not have to rely on the public transport,  but you may have a problem finding parking space (during peak hours) due to the limited parking lots .

Despite diners returning their trays, table cleaning needs to be better (more hygienic and faster).

A great place.  I love to visit this hawker centre but for the absence of regular public transport.."
"Good food as usual...a great place to satisfy your cravings...With good company, good food, you can never be wrong"
Variety of local food 
Good local foods here
Food heaven
"Ordered mutton satay well done and  another set crispy.  Taste absolutely delicious dunk in the satay sauce.

Sweet and nutty flavoured satay sauce, my personal preference would have love if spicy level is higher.

Got sides of cucumbers ,  tomatoes and  salads, with ketupat - rice cake.

Flush down with teh tark, (mamak milk tea) and bandung.

Definitely a place to go to for Satay lovers."
"A very wonderful experience dining here on a weekend. Haven't been here since their renovation and I'm very surprised that the renovation actually gave a major makeover of the entire place.

It has high roofs and better ventilation throughout the entire place. However, there is no shelter at certain places and I think it will post a issue if there's heavy rain and wind.

The must tries here are song kee fried oyster omelette, bbq chicken wings, satay, han jia pig trotters, geyland prawn noodle!

Do come here early to secure your seats really.. The later you come the harder it is for you to find seats.. And people tend to eat very slowly and you will need to wait for a long time for seats."
Difficult to find seats
Hard to find table to eat during raining season and festival season.
"Comfort food, bustling ambience. Overall a nice place to be"
"Love to eat sambal stingray, seafood and satays here and have sugarcane juice "
Not an ideal place for introvert.
"Expect to wait 30-45min for a table
Satay standard still there. However do count the number of satay you ordered as I gotten lesser for what I ordered.
Zi Char stall overall has good seafood.
Beer price reasonable"
"Had dinner here after such a long time! Crowded like crazy but still worth the food served. Shout out for the satay, BBQ stingray n Won Ton Mee!!!"
Great service.. beautiful beachfront
Sea food us good
Food too expensive and not value for money.
Long time never come.. Crowd is there.. Got chance will come again..
"Good food but not enough shades for the tables and benches. Also, the food stains & scraps of them could be found on the benches. It'll be great if these shared amenities are properly maintained for a more pleasant dining experience."
great place for great hawker food!
"So many food to choose from, but I usually head there for satay. Stall SIXTY is my favourite."
Just love this place for the options it has. I usually order satays and drinks.
"Great place. It is what you make of it.
Great variety of food, cold drinks and an atmosphere always a bit different.
Renovations spoiled view."
"Nothing much special. Food is normal. Tourist Price. But.......Don't forget, you have a beautiful SEA..you can enjoy many local foods. You can ride, wet, enjoy the coconut drink with your friends and family.
Its the SEA that make the place worth going there. ;)"
Superb food for family hangout.
Very crowded during the weekends... Difficult to find seating.... But could get nice satays and other varieties of food...
Good food!
Great affortable food. Enjoy spending great time with family
"Not many hawker Center or ""village"" is situation right next to the beach! So a big Plus!

As for the stalls, it offers a good mixed of food to consider. Aside from the mist order seafood dishes from Cze Char stalls and Satays, there are several stalls worth shouting for its longevity being one of the earliest pioneers!

Stalls like the braised duck rice, beef noodles, oyster omelette, Hainanese curry puff and my fave Cantonese style Porridge with its chicken cold salad are must try to many visiting ones.

These will often be forming Qs so worth the wait!

Being a popular haunt in Eastern side of SG, the car park are often pack with patrons and also beach goers. So plan early or take public transport to avoid jammed parking lots especially during holidays or weekends."
Yummy. Nice environment.
Good hawker food.No 56 satay shiok
Ok. Nice local food.
Excellent and nice place to dine !!
A lot of satay stall and some good seafood stalls too..
"Family place since it's near the coast.  A lot of food choices, try carrot cake (black), satay, egg fried rice,"
"Nice place for gathering even in the kerning, afternoon and evening. There are various of stall that sell so much variety of food. In all types of Asian food. Even you can taste Thai food and barbarque  stuff. All are so reasonable price. You can have beer,liquor drink before 10.00pm."
"At last, I got to eat crab. It was delicious. The last time where I ate the crab they have given me a hammer and knife to eat but this time they have given me a fork only so I have to break the shell with my hand which was messing. But it was yummy for sure "
Oyster egg is one of the best.
Love the food there. Affordable hawker next to the sea.
Street food best location.
"Ahmad spring Satay was busy. Despite this, we had excellent mutton and beef Satay.
The place was much cleaner since the return your tray campaign started."
Too crowded. Best satay from Harun Satay stall. It was bigger than usual. Very good
"Good variety of seafood. You will love the place if you like coastal vibes, live music and beer.
Food is really cheap here and every penny you spend is totally worth."
"Good place but need to have more parking slots, traffic jam on weekend"
"We packed the food and had it on the beach. I am vegetarian and it was too difficult to find veg food. Though there is Thai outlet called Siam Thai Kitchen and he said he will make vegetarian for us. We took spring roll, Thai curry rice and pad thai noodles. The taste was nice."
no need explain
Stall 38! Must buy!
The sun the sea and good company what else can you ask for?
Delicious food
Not so crowded when we visit. Lots of stall. Ample empty seats. Grilled chicken wings were good. Satay nice too
"Many good local food available, weekend is very crowded but not during weekday."
Cheap good food. Great atmosphere. Crowded on weekends. Have to wait for a table
Food are nice. But the touting of satay sellers are a really turn off
Nice place.
"Beach,many halal food,go bedok mall/MRT take teksi around sgd7"
3/4 of the stalls are selling similar foods.
"Tried only Satay there, and it was fantastic! Heard from many people that other food is good too. Recommended."
One of the best places to be for Dinner
Same food high price. Not much improve since 20years ago
"A wonderful place to go enjoy a wide variety of local dishes from Satay to BBQ Stingrays, from Wanton noodles to BBQ chicken wings. Big cup of Sugar cane juice or an ice cold beer with occasional sea breeze blowing through. Definitely a great place to visit and relax, but just the seats and tables... Wished it could be more..."
"Didnt managed to get the famous fried oyster as i was there too early.
They only open at 4pm... i ordered from another store and to my surprise it taste good and less oily..."
Yay it's finally back after so long! One of the best places to eat at East Coast. But go at an off peak time as it's very crowded. Once past 11pm the stalls are mostly closed except for a couple of drink stalls
Satay nice but depends on which stall..........surprisingly 54 beat 55 today. Forever Stingray still among the best there for stingray...
Great food heaven
Really love the local food here. Good place to bring your foreign friends here.
"The duck rice is really awesome, must reserve earlier.
Next time sure will come again and share some photos for yours."
"Food is good, can be very humid at times. But nothing beats eating nearby the sea. And food is definitely not as expensive as eating at other beaches"
Please go earlier to get a seat for dinner. It gets awfully crowded.
Lots of seafood. Enjoyed the coast area.
Lots of different foods
A lot of cheap food choices
Food is good. But difficult to get seats during weekends or on some weekdays evening.
Hen Shu Huan Ya Li
Got food poisoning but the flavours and taste were outright amazing of course disregarding the after effects i would definitely visit again as the food here was simply excellent
"After empty my energy at East Coast Park, a nice place to replenish it through nice food and nice drink."
"One of the most popular open hawker centres in Singapore.  It helps that parking spaces are aplenty but yet filled to the brim during peak hours, weekends and public holidays.  Great for those looking for BBQ and grilled foods over some alcoholic beverages while letting their hair down in this open air eating place and without having to care about fine dining etiquette BS.  The ambience is great especially starting from dusk while the weekend crowds provide a certain carnival-like atmosphere.  After having one's fill, one could take a stroll to the nearby Bedok Jetty or wake boarding park before adjourning elsewhere or heading home.  A must-see & must-try for anyone visiting Singapore.  If one yearns for some seafood, there are a few restaurants within walking distance that serve great seafood but at a premium."
Bak Ku Teh is marvelous
Nice food and environment
"Great choices, good location, but wish closer to the beach"
I like it here because of the video variety of food and it's in open space.
Scenic Hawker centre by the sea.
Limited sheltered sitting area. Not practical for Singapore weather
"I LOVED ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT , THE FOOD IS NICE"
Khong nen bo qua dia diem nay. Co rat nhieu mon ngon . Co the ngam bien va  an uong
Beautiful place to chill and have great food.
The good to place for hawker food
"Spoilt for choices. Always come here to tabao different types of food. Although its crowded on the weekend, food is ready at a reasonable time since we had from a few stalls.

The waiting part is just about walking around the beach area or watching the wake boarders.

Had pari sambal from Musa . Bbq chicken from ahmad spring. And gonggong from ocean muslim food. @ 26 February 2022.

The 4 stars is for the choices available. Waiting is not great, but didnt find it a problem. Had sugarcane and sightseeing."
Nice hawker food by the sea
Very tradition open concept food market. Food is nice. Just need to watch yr personal hygiene! I like the oyster and carrot cake.
"Wonderful food options! Satay, barbeque chicken wings and ice cold beer is the best combination that you should get after strolling the park. Such a rewarding meal after sweating!"
"Unfortunately, I was disappointed when I finally got to try this place out. It looks quite nice and clean, has lots of food options, and the food we had was quite quite good, but I couldn't help feeling the touristy/expat vibe of the place. The thing that turned me off the most was the touting from almost every stall, despite the large ""No Touting"" signs everywhere. I prefer the more relaxed, friendly atmosphere of the more local hawker centres around Singapore."
"Al fresco dining, indulging in local food fare at its best. Satay Haron - Stall 55 recommended. Must try their BBQ Chicken Wings."
Have to enter from the carpark side entrance. Food is as wonderful as ever.
Always my go to place for good food ^^
Those loves satay everything all have awesome must go good recommended
best place to chill and relax.. food definitely is the best esp their satay! come with family and friend
"The place is a little hot and stuffy, so try to get yourself a table with fan directed to you. When nearby stalls are cooking it can be also quite suffocating. Try to move away or towards the center of the place for a seat.

Very crowded place during peak hours and not easy to find seats. Also not a very convenient place to bring baby along as there are no baby chairs. Also do note its a little dirty when its peak hours.

Food is not too bad though the prices are a little higher than expected. Everything comes in Styrofoam or plastic, so don't expect a hotplate to be served in actual hot-plate "
"Get fresh sugar cane juice, seafood and barbecue etc
We tried olive fried rice from thai hawker centre which was vegetarian!
It was really tasty"
"it nice place for gathering and have a lots of variety for seafood. It busy on Friday till Sunday around 7pm to 9.30pm.
You might have to wait and look for avaliable seat. Only patience need if you still want yo enjoy the food there."
Good selection of food. A number of good stall but the place is a bit too crowded
Great food but its rather crowded during dinner time.
"Have not been there for a few years already.

Love the wide variety of food choices available.

I recommend satay, satay bee Hoon and large sugar cane drinks.

My suggestion is to arrive before 5.15 pm for dinner on Saturday if you want to avoid the crowd.

The car park gets crowded after 5.30 pm on Saturday.

If you have kids, bring them to the playground first and have dinner later.

Nice ambience as it is near the beach and sea.

It gets smokey though because of the many satay stalls."
This fried hokkein noodle is really good. The bee hoon and yellow noodle proportion is just right and the prawn is very fresh. And it is not too dry and not too wet....just nice. Should try.... for those who love fried hokkein noodle but be prepare to wait during dinner time. The stall will give u a queue number so u can go to other stall to buy food
"I'd you're not sure what to get then go for stingray, kailan, rice and some satay. Can't go wrong all day long. "
"Such a good revamp now that it's been renovated and upgraded (it has been now for a while). Good range of foods. But you're never sure which stalls are currently open cos of covid. I'd recommend getting satay at harons, beef noodles, chicken wings, and the half and half carrot cakes. Wash it all down with a regular sized or giant cup of sugar cane juice like a tourist ;)..."
Reminds me of the old Satay Club. Good choice of satay stalls.
Nothing fantastic
Great for the family to have a nice feast after some nice bonding sessions! I recommend this seafood stall manned by this short bespectacled uncle. He'll advice what portions fit for the whole family.
Pricey foodcourt. Crowded. Hard to find table. Foods taste so so to us.
"Great place to chill and eat by the sea. Shame they built a fence in front of the place which ruins the old uninterrupted sea views. Lots of food choices, had some carrot cake, bak kuh teh and Char kway teow today, all good."
Most of the food stall provide nice taste but price a little expensive.
"Some days food are better, some days food are not as tasty.. so I guess depends on the cooks mood."
Zhe Li De Shi Wu Ye You Shao Shu Zu Qun Shi Wu Shao Kao De Shi Wu Jin Sha Tan Wan Shang Hao Qing Jing Ji You Hai Feng Dan Zhou Mo Kai Che Qu Bi Jiao Yin Nan
Not a place for vegetarians. I roamed the entire area for several times but couldn't find any place to have vegetarian food and ended up leaving empty stomach.
"Very long lines
Sometimes bland"
Food still good.
Huat Ah!!!!! Local favorite seafood at affordable price. Try to avoid weekend crowds. Weekday definatedly best!!!!
If you are craving for seafood trust me here is the best place everytime I step in the food place the smell makes my stomach growl I love eating ikan pari as we could not go Johor Soo we get to feeling2 Abit there the price is also affordable in a way but for sure it will make your stomach full u can come with your family members but as always social distancing but I recommend alot 
There are alot of my favourite food
"Haven't visited in years. BBQ chicken wings were so disappointing, somehow tasted more braised than bbqed"
"Nice hawker center, try to avoid weekends  evening, too busy."
Weather  is very good for eating
If you're Cycling east coast side this is the best place to fill in some carbs! affordable and some shops open till midnight 2am. 
Ah Hwee bbq wings are so good! Crispy skin bbq to perfection. The aunty is friendly too.
Heavy rain now
Love going there for the satay and sugarcane juice after a long bicycle ride.
Very good place.
Nice local food
Variety of food and beverages.. A bit crowded at times.
"Alot of good malay, chinese n indian food. But. Very2 hard to find table to eat. Parking, another big problem. Especially weekend & holiday."
"Great, but there has to be better toilet facilities."
"Nice, bustling hawker centre with a lot of high quality choices incl. delicious seafood. Prime location at East Cosst Park-perfect to go for a meal or refreshing coconut after a nice walk"
"Satays,  seafood,  all other foods & beverages are all awesomely delicious. Still affordable. Many varieties to choose from. If you have a good big appetite stomach, great place for dinner with friends and families."
"Food in general was good and affordable. However, not sure what else the appeal would be because it is always so unbelievably crowded, especially at night. You can never find any seating/tables and because of the high volume of people, expect to wait 15-20 mins for your food. With the crowd, it's hard to even hold a conversation because it's so loud.

Better option would just be to have your food to-go and have them at a bench/table by the sea where it's quieter."
Food is good and variety choices. Cleanliness need improvement.
"Lots of food like satay, fried carrot cake, bbq chicken wings, grilled seafood offered here. The sugar cane juice with lemon is my go to. Recommend to come around 5 for dinner, as it gets crowded. If you are coming for lunch do note that many stalls do not open till evening time."
"Plenty of great food here! Personal favs are Satay Bee Hoon, Curry Puff, Stingray, BBQ Chix Wings! Not forgetting a huge cup of sugar can juice with lemon!"
Wide variety of local Singapore hawker food
Still an awesome place to visit after so many years
Such a great spot right on the beach and next to wake park. The market was so busy and such a great variety of food stalls. Looking forward to our return. 
"Another famous food centre in Singapore. The place to visit for seafood, satay and other local delicacies.
Had a lot of satay during our last trip, was so yummy! The sting ray and sambal kang kong is a must try with the chilli crab. A bit messy eating but sinks available around the place to wash your hands.
And remember to return your plates to stations located throughout the centre, otherwise it is $300 fine! "
"Tasty food..not many stalls were open for lunch. Stalls that were had our food is  5 stars..satay, bak kut teh, popiah."
"All time favorite for many years.. We, family spent many weekends there and enjoyed food there."
Best go-to seafood and chill out with friends or families!
"I always come for the grilled wings, the best in Asia IMHO."
Stop by for Teh halia .. it was good 
"Good, I love satay stands there!"
Great food and scenery in the evening
Variety of food options. Just you will need some patience to find a table.
Nice place
The food here is great! I got char Kway teow but everything else looked and smelled great. This is a very clean hawker centre which is hard to find sometimes. I recommend this place while heartedly. The bathrooms are also very clean.
So many food to choose from
"Best ever local delights. Get stingray & bamboo clam from stall 37, Eastern Red."
"It's a very popular hawker centre being close to the east coast park. So you might want to avoid peak hours. I could see mostly seafood. I'm a vegetarian so had some problems but found vegetarian food at the Thai stall.
Must try the sugarcane juice. Apart from that i could hardly find any other fresh fruit juice."
Food was good and cheapest.
Long queue during peak hours
Nice foods n ambience.
Go there to relax and chill but the food is just average and a little pricey.
"Wide range of varieties....though a bit pricey
The satay was a BOMB"
"Tons of good food ranging from halal satay, bbq seafood. If you are a tourist please visit this place if u going to east coast park."
No vegetarian options 
This has been around since I was small. Brings back all age of memories
"We came here for Haron satay. It's thick, juicy and tasty. The best satay in the east!"
During the cycling we had lunch at the usual food village. The duck rice in the queue was fantastic. The sugar cane juice was also a welcome relief.
Very systematic and decent space.. support our local food
Worst eating place of all. Will not go there anymore.
"Most stalls selling seafood zichar, hokkien meet, satay etc. Not much options for breakfast here"
Ample parking space. Foods are averages charged. Finding of seats may take awhile.
Nice outdoor hawker Centre next to the beach - large variety of food for everyone. Spacious with lots of seating and well priced
"Recently renovated, very popular with the crowds, spacious and adequate seating, great atmosphere and well ventilated. Lots of local varieties though expect to pay about a dollar or two more for each dish. Well worth it though. A few stalls have gotten cocky because of the patronage, but in the long run they'll lose out to the friendlier ones."
"1 of the Best outing Food Paradise in Singspore, & nice view b the Seaside, Satay. HARON SATAY IS THE Best"
"Lots of different Food, the grilled chicken wings taste lovely, must-try! Satay are OK."
Sedappp and niceee
Good variety of food. Beside the beach. Nice atmosphere.
Great tasting food selection at some of the lowest prices in Singapore
"We always come to this place for meal after cycling. And this the second times we order the same chicken wing and satay stall, the stall is at front and near the entrance. You might find the satay a bit small piece compare to others but the taste is good. And their chicken wing is the best.

Drinks we ordered a super huge lemon sugar cane juice, refreshing, quench our thirst."
Man Bu Cuo De Xiu Xian De Di Fang
Great hawker near the beach. Food variety. Can be a quite warm in the afternoons.
Nice place to eat local food with sea view scenery.
"Not worth the long ride to come to this place. Don't use the online ordering. Sometimes they miss it, instead of faster serving time, it doubles the time. Better order directly at the stall. Newton Food Plaza is still better"
"Good food, but prices and serving sizes now becoming like newton"
Recommended place for satay n seafood
Best place for satay and bbq wings and seafood. Lots of halal and non halal varieties.
Not only for you to exercise here but to find some local food too.
Not that crowd today 
"seating area was a bit dirty but i guess cant be helped v much since it was raining earlier today. it wasnt stuffy but i also went around 5pm and it was mostly quite empty then

satay was pretty good but grass jelly drink and coconut drink was too sweet and not very nice :'-)"
"This hawker centre is one of singapore sea side hawker food where u get to enjoy local delicacies near to the beach. It has tons of halal options and the food is averagely price

If you are looking for a weekend breakaway while enjoying some decent food, this is the place to go. But avoid the weekends cause, everyone is thinking the same as you. Its really crowded."
"Good ol Lagoon, with a wide variety of food offered. Had Sugarcane and Satay here. Try out from different stalls over time. Still can't figure out which has the best Satay.."
Food Paradise...
"Great satays, beer and coconut drink."
Was very crowded on a Saturday evening.
"Even though today is Monday, yet No stopping people coming back for their favorite seafood,  beers and the beach... 5 person dining is available... Cheers"
Food is good although limited seats and some pushy stalls though not as bad as Lau Pa Sat
"Very popular food centre .Mostly super crowded during weekends and public holidays.
Near the beach where u can take walk after you had your meal."
"Love the satay and chicken wing here. Just make sure you find the right stall. Look at the other reviews. For parking, it gets full after 6.30pm so try to get here earlier if you do not want to wait for a parking lot."
It's a nice place to eat good seafood.
Satay is still at 70cents. Alot of shops to choose from.
"The atmosphere is great, food is great and service is good"
"Great hangout spot with friends to enjoy some BBQ. The food is honestly not the best tasting, slightly above average price, and small portion. Come here to have a great time with friends, enjoy the ambiance and variety of bbq/ seafood."
"Good food, nice place & view !!!"
Have many variety of local food served.
Crazy vrowds famalam
Very crowded.
Food meblessss.....
Quite crowded and have to wait a long time for satay. Food was OK altho more exp than other hawker centres
They have quite a few stalls which are famous. The food is good although the price is not cheap.
Wide varierty of foods available.. Simple loved the Satay at stall no.55
All the food there was nice n cheap.
"Xuan Xiang Duo,Jia Ge Bu Gui"
no one come wipe the table. walk back to carpark take my wipes and clean the table myself
"So many nice food bbq chicken wings,"
Try the Thai zi char... It's quite nice
Popular relax hangout with great variety of food and beverages for locals and tourists!
Best melt in your mouth pig trotters. Simply love it. Reasonable prices too.
"Foodcourt with the sea view, super location and food if you are not vegetarian, unfortunately only 1 stall with vegetarian dishes (Thai)."
The food here is great. If you're looking for local eats and you're in the east this is definitely a place to check out. There's great food at every corner. A great place by the beach and a great place to hang out with friends and family. It can be tough to find a seat but definitely worth it.
Atmospheric scenes
Well worth a visit. Good for family gatherings.
"Food pretty generic except for a few stalls. The overall layout, space and vibe make up for it. A fav hawker center."
Nice ambient and reminder of old dragon boat days.
love the smell of these street eats
"Varieties of stall with yummy food, clean, spacious n breezy environment. Near e beach with hut sitting area.
But inconvenience location if not driving."
Nice food & affordable price. The hokkien noodles & bak ku teh yummlicous
Has a wide range of local hawker food from Chinese to Malay cuisine with ample seating places. Prices are reasonable with options to pay either via digital or in cash. The hawker centre is open from early morning till late in the evening 7 days a week.
"Wide space Hawker food Center.
It is located East Coast, beside of sea, walking road.
It is clean, big, good atmosphere escaped city area.

Hokkien mee, Skewers, Beers are really tasty and enjoyable !!
Note for myself, Beer 1 bottle of Anchor is $6.7 inclusive GST.

It is good for daily use and bring your foreign friends here to feel Singapore."
Never go on monday. Good stalls aren't open on money.
"What a shame, food court is newly renovated, directly at the see and they are serving everything on STYROFOAM. This shows the owner of this Court doesn't care about the future of Singapore and our planet!"
"Lovely hawker center, really clean facilities. Happy with food options"
"Good food, chill beer and great atmosphere"
This place food really good and cheap.
Without East Coast there's no singapore
"Place was clean and there was ample seating. Takeaway food was cooked fast at various stalls we ordered from and well packed. Prices were higher than I remembered but still reasonable. If in the area and looking for a variety of local Singaporean hawker fare, worth a visit"
Large food hawker area located next to the beach. Heaps of different types of food and drink. Heaps of seating
Good food but not cheap
Nice atmosphere with lots of good food
Nice duck rice and satay.
Clean n friendly. Always luv the satay's here.
"Had a great lunch, with sugar cane drinks. Nice old couple and friendly."
Great food and variety
My wife and daughter seems to enjoy the duck rice.
Hawkers are rude and aggressive..They scold you I'd you refuse to buy from them or walk pass them..Bad environment for families.
"Nice clean beach not too crowded. Best of all, walking distance there is a public wash room.
Many squirrels and they are not afraid if we don't go too near to them."
"Nice Satays, sugar came drinks, BBQ chicken wings"
Many good food but most are opened after 1700hrs. Haron Satay is good but is ready after 1600hrs only.
Nice place for relaxation and food.
"Chicken wings!!!
That stall in front of the beer hut!!!"
We usually go from 1730-1830hrs. Avoid Monday's- most stalls closed and weekends- crowds.
"Nice place for beer, Satay and BBQ foods"
"A great place to eat variety foods and all races can enjoy their favourite food. INDIAN MALAY, CHINESE hope can have one western food stall will be great. That will make International eateries centre."
"Satay, chicken wings, beer and the beach. Just perfect."
Bbq seafood & chicken wing craving settled!
"Bbq chicken wings from Ah Hwee is amazeballs! Auntie was very friendly and courteous 
The sugarcane lemon drink which costs $4 for the large was very very refreshing (sorry i forgot the name of the stall, but it was right by the corner). I will always go back to them for my favourites!"
This is where I can find satay bro
Fiancee loved the wide variety of bbq sea food and satay.
Best place to dine in and the staff all friendly
"Food is Great, Vendors are Friendly Truly Singapore"
Great food though a bit crowded
Good satay
Good food n nice surroundings
Fresh air & good food.
Satay not as good as before.........
Always excited place
"Malay Satay stall nearest the beach has seriously best tasty satay,  tripe satay was tender n well seasoned. It's right beside a sugar cane stall. And a lot of other Malay satay stalls."
"Crowded ( week end ) but didn't wait long to get a seat . Car park is also full , need to wait for a while . Good variety of food ."
I don't like it.
Food hunting..
Nice n good food always esp Salmon.. Relaxing ~
"Pls dont go to virus area , none of the check, plus foriegners never clear their plates , none of the sdo officers there to tell. Especially amoh and indian nationalities"
"Went there before 4pm. The place is deserted , due to most stalls are just opening. Was there to collect pre ordered satay for the office. Normal, safr entry protocol was in place.
Cannot comment much as I was there for less than 10 minutes."
Very Less parking especially for motorcycles and very crowded during weekends..tables also very limited even just upgraded..
"Zhe Li De Sha Die,Hei Bai Cai Tou Guo Du Hen Hao Chi,Ke Yi Xuan Ze Yi Jia Da Xiao Lai San Bu. "
"Service are same as normal food court. There are wide variety of food with reasonable pricing.

You might not want to come on a peak hours as there might not be enough seats available, due to COVID-19 restrictions."
Best place for makan everything have down there
It's a hawker ctr. Things are priced much higher here than in at your normal hawker ctr. But that's the way the cookie crumbles
Worth travelling here to eat. The prices are cheap and the food is great! You get many choices as well. Highly recommend
"Ordered from huat huat bbq seafood. Portion is very small for the price. We were not full at the end and had to go somewhere else for more food. Taste is ok though.

Staff don't seem very friendly, often rushing us to place an order.

However, the aunty and uncle at the bbq wings store were very nice. $1.30 per wing (wing + drumlet), tasted pretty good."
Nice food good vendors
Always lobely to be here but the food place was close last friday
"Great food, typical great night hawker place to go!"
best hokkien mee in Singapore!
Good seafood place! And you can find nice satay here too. Although not very accessible by public transport but food here is worth it.
Like any big hawker centre in Singapore. This place is clean and looks modern. The place has good food as well.
great place for a cheap and fun date experience
Strongly recommended a lit and lots of delicious food...
"Good food, good ambience, good prices."
"Apparently too many stalls selling the same thing.

At least 8-10 stalls of satay and bbq chicken wing."
Nice place got more food at night delicious to eat .
Beautifully located hawker Centre
Great food but above average pricing.
"Not the best food in singapore but if you are cycling, strolling, walking or running in east coast park. Think no other better places for satay, beer, sugar cane drinks and chicken wings. Wings are from wing wing chicken stall, drinks is 001 and satay is 2nd stall (big and juicy as compared to heng heng but heng heng winga are awesome"
Love the food at this seafood zichar stall which is on the extreme left when you enter the Food Centre. Can't have enough of their Fish Maw Soup which is the thick type. It goes very nicely with lotsa black vinegar and a dash of pepper. The Qing Long vegetable is also one of our favourite. Their other dishes are yummy too but we have been hooked on this 2 dishes 
Very crowded
"Satay club of the east!
So many stalls for you to choose!
Personally used to like Haron, but not as nice as before. Now for satay, I go toMusa.

So many different type of food for you to choose from. Satay, bbq Chicken Wings, beef noodles, Wanton noodle, Rojak, Sting Ray, duck rice, pork trotter, zi char, mamak mee.goreng, nasi goreng etc. So many food choices!

One whole coconut may be too much for you, opt for a cup of coconut water instead. "
Good place to visit for seafood after a walk at the east coast park. Pricing is relatively ok. Should also try the coconut and sugar cane drink.
There is a wide variety of food catered to different taste buds but the Vending Machine near toilet E1 near Aloha Sea Sports Centre is very poorly maintained and infested with insects and flies.
Love the food options here. We look forward to this for our trips to the ecp
I ate carrot cake. And sugar cane juice. Dear foreigners... if you are here. Drink sugar cane juice. And share with your grandchildren. 
Best satay and chicken wings that I have
"It kind of lacks of variety of foods, however if your aim is to have seafood here is the place.
They also cook satay at a reasonable price."
Hawker centre by the beach.
Ambience is decent. Fairly clean but and great variety of food selection. Satay touts are annoying thou
What is there not to love .. but do come down early to avoid crowd and seating
"Still one of the best hawkers in Singapore!

Plenty of tables to sit around, variety of food and great vibes along the sea.

Seafood, Satay, Chicken wings and Sugar Cane are essentials when visiting. Love this place!"
"I liked the environment...though its hot during the day..a few good stalls there...my favourite is the duck rice...even if business good n long queue, the service is damn good..especially the female aunty...keep it up...i lived far away but cos of their humble attitude n listening, I always travel half way cross sg to here"
I went  walking with my son n family   up n down 5km walk.Nice to walk n  eat after the walk.
Good place for food but parking too congested for motorbike
Very nice places
"Wide selection of local food, but only slightly more expensive than hawker centre."
Many local nice dishes
My local mee goreng and drinks place. :)
It's a nice place to drop by have a rest and continue cycling again. I had my dinner at the food village and I love the alfresco dining environment
Missed the satays from the Malay stalls.  Yummy. Despite its abit too oily on the plates
Nice place to have a tender coconut
Generally lesser crowds but there were still people who gathered in more than 2 adults in a group.
"You would go there more for the vibe rather than food. Although the food are good but not the best price in town. Still I would return to this place for a night out anytime, but very warm under mid-day Sun."
Satay too sweet n lots of fats.Hokkien mee too salty.barbacue chicken and stingray thumbs up
"Must visit when you visit East Coast! Go for the duck rice, chicken wings as well as the wonton noodles there!"
"great food, good vibes!"
very tasty delicious fresh Oysters fried with eggs ++ ingredients
Food is fairly good. Many stall closed due to covid.
"Classic food place.. varieties of food to choose but seafood is know for that area!
Beach is just a few steps away to stroll about after a good meal.."
"Stalls to try:
No.45 Hwa Kee Barbeque Pork Noodle
- Wanton Noodle

No.43 Stingray Forever BBQ Seafood
- Fresh Salmon with Garlic
- Hottest Stingray

No.40 Lagoon Famous Carrot Cake
- Black Carrot Cake

Had food from these 3 stalls specifically. Food is amazing. Try to believe! Amazing taste of food that is worth every single cent from your wallet. Price is very reasonable."
"If you are looking to get authentic Singaporean food, then this is the place to go. Over here, you can find all types of Singaporean cuisines, ranging from satay to chilli crab to carrot cake to many more. You can also dabao to enjoy your food at the beach while watching the sunset."
Nice dining experience there. The area is spacious and clean. Food wise is pretty decent with not much to complain or shout about.
Hen Xi Huan Dong Xi Hao Chi Bu Gui
Too crowded and not clean
Ate here countless times. Great tasting and cheap local food!
"Able to get breakfast before 9am at the lagoon.
Favourites are nasi lemak, longtong or mee rebus"
2 person per table
Awesome like always!!
Got halal & non halal food here. And many choices. Many people on weekends.
"You feel relaxed as it is by the beach. There are many stalls with a long history.

The hokkien mee, carrot cake, oyster omelette, chicken wings and satay are not bad. Sugar cane is also good for the weather.

Also, do not feel pressured by anyone trying to sell you something."
Nice sea side view with nice food and beer.
"Go for the braised duck , bak kut teh. And that's reason to go."
"I come 2 weeks ago, sunday. Community getting normal after vaccination bcs there is many visitors enjoy ECP but, the stalls not fully reopen yet. Will add some picture when im free"
I Hope By Next Year.I Go There With My Family Without Wear Mask.........
"With more than 70 stalls to choose from and a beautiful beach view, delicious food (satay, seafood, coconuts, sugar cane jucies, etc), spacious and windy. New mobile phone charging and food waste management to be introduced soon."
Nice place to eat and chill
Too crowded.
The place was crowded on the weekend nights and not easy to find seats but the drink stall helper is very helpful to find seats for customer
As usual awesome place with variety of dishes. I used to take my girlfriend on a date to this place. Now she is my wife.
"it's either a hit or a miss when you come here.. one day you'll find a stall you like, next time you come at the same day and time, it decides to close.. it would help if there's much less touting too.."
The beauty of beach never changed
I love the food and the place
"Similar to Newton Food center. Nice place for Satay, sea food..."
Very good 
Love the Sugarcane juice !
Very smoky...insufficient fans to clear the smoke frm satay stalls. Wld be good to have proper ventilation ducts for satay stall and more fans at the seats to cool off the heat
I went for satays which were tasty.
"Food is ok, but very crowded"
WE REALLY MISS THIS PLACE AFTER THE RENOVATION AND TODAY WE MAKE IT FOR OUR DINNER.... THE FOOD IS FABULOUS AND DELICIOUS PLUS AFFORDABLE 
"Quite disappointed overall. Only the BBQ Chicken wings and the Hokkien noodles were good, the rest really cannot make it. Cos really want to eat Pork Satay so ordered from the Chinese stall, dry and stale!  The BBQ also a waste of money! The Orh Luan that's was recommended by a friend miss the mark."
Braised duck  n internal organs n pig's ear is good ..must try
Service & Food was so good. Friendly servers and I would want to take my guests there for a good meal worth the amount paid for.
Great open outdoor hawker near east coast seaside. A good variety of local food.
"The best place for satay, bbq chix wings and teh tarikkk.. Was here twice this week.. Awesomely awesome.. "
Good venue for bbq stingray etc with halal and non halal options.
The hawker centre is way too small for the crowd it attracts resulting in an unpleasant experience with so many people (especially so during the pandemic). Food selection are also quite limited due to the repetitiveness of the food stalls.
Lots of nice food around. One of the very crowded food center especially during weekend. A must stop if we visit East Coast Park. 
Money of your choice..good for family outing.
I found very good satay and chilli crab
Crowded as usual but stil managed to find seat in d day..nite usually packed..food ok2 some good some not so..
Always nice to makan here
Very nice place to bring my children there.
Best for seafood varieties!
Love the place and Bah Kuh teh
"Han Jia Bak Kut Teh Pork Leg- the braised pig trotter is very Good. There is some other ingredients in the black sauce that make it nice and thick. Koon at Boon Lay is good. But this is definitely better. Will eat from Han Jia, whenever I am some where in the east."
"10am on a Sunday with ECP bustling and only 10% of the stalls were open.
Out of the 1st 5 drink stalls visited, none of them offered coffee/hot drinks (at 10am!?!?!).
Only one near the back (Aloha Beach Club) had kopi."
Very nice food
"Great variety of street food. Sate, fish, meat, Indonesian, Chinese and Malaysia food. Chilled beer and soft drinks, fresh juice. Open air seating, sea breeze."
Sugarcane and hawker food~
"Support the local hawker, their perseverance and service is impeccable"
"If you are in Singapore, and you are in a very bad situation, or depressed, sad and wanna quit in life. Come to East Coast and relax."
"Satay stick is 
Ice lemon tea is 
Hokkien Mee is 
My belly is "
"Many people waiting for table, else is normal as other hawkers"
All country food this is place available. Lots of sit place . Toilet speciality available . Very clean
"East Coast Lagoon Village
Airy hawker near the lagoon area of East Coast Park, popular with park goers and bikers. Known for its grilled goods, there are several satay grillers around. We like the Wanton Mee from Hwa Kee

The Damage (no drinks): S$ 10-20 for two

~~TRY:
// Carrot Cake ~ Lagoon CC 01-40
// Wanton Mee ~ Hwa Kee 01-45

Follow us at IG: eatsmorefun"
"Still great place for food but due to safe distancing need to be early to get seats. Carpark as usually need time to get a lot, wish they can increase lots for those who come for beach activities."
Long queue for very nice duck rice and duck porridge. Yummy! Worth to wait!
A little pricy but it's worth.
Functional hawker center with an attached beach
A varity of local food available with affordable price. Good location near sea.
Nice food center.
Local food. A little pricey for the same kind of food you get at the heartland hawker centers. There's no other choice of local food nearby.
"Plenty of food choices, wonderful ambience,  don't miss chicken satays n seebass fry"
A lot of varieties to choose
So many food to choose 
Very crowded. Good food.
"Wife loves the live prawn from BBQ seafood and also the stingray. She bugs me to bring her here every week. Compared to other full scale Chinese restaurants , this is about half price. I guess that means 3-4x the value...."
Hawker center along the coast. Great to grab a bite when cycling!
"Best food, best atmosphere. Sea breeze sunset nice company.."
"A popular haunt for hawker food aficionados, this place has lots of choices. Plenty of seating (now limited by anti-pandemic meadures). Tried the Siam Thai Kitchen today. Nothing special about the padthai was kailan vege but the springroll was crispy, tasty & highly recommended."
Many varieties of food available great place with family
Nice place for our cycling break in the evening.. best sugarcane juice & fried oyster & carrot cake.
Nothing special about this place Food could be better and Better crowd control could be enforced. Many flies and mosquitoes
Went to Dapao during phase 2 HA. Most stalls still closed.
So many satay stores to choose from! The wantan noodle is also awesome
Nice place to exercise n get great local food. slightly more expensive vs heartland hawkers but seaview worth it
. Shop that has the best Satay is handsdown ...SIXTY . Old school boss/ great friendly senior guys penganging the satay . (Old Haron is now second best to me) The Mutton & Chix satay is best so far in that order. The pengang Stingray is the A1 and largest size for $12 in ECfC. Highly reccomended . Boss's name is Din good Singaporean old school guy  .
Beautiful place to eat enjoy
Wide range of local foods
A popular eatery place when people visited ECP.
"With the current covid situation, this place lacks choices as most shops are closed, also probably being a first day of the week."
The place is still the same as the foods are still nice because the same vendors are still selling there.
Nothing for vegetarian
Will be better when covid restrictions are over. Can't sit and eat now.
"Great place for dine in and takeaways. Halal stalls available.

ECP is famous for its satay, BBQ Chicken Wings and the seafood stalls. Mostly reasonably priced."
A great place to stop over for an ice cold coconut drink and enjoy all the nice local food...
"I have tried the carrot cakes, hokkien mee, and oyster omelettes from various stalls and none of them are worth revisiting. The only food worth mentioning is the satay. I can safely say that I will not be going out of the way to come back here."
"Went in the morning and most of the stalls were closed, except for hand few."
"Lai Xin Jia Po Hen Jiu Liao,Dan Shi Huan Shi Ge Yi Duan Shi Jian Hui Guo Qu Kan Kan De. "
Nice dining by the beach. Always crowded though when dining-in is allowed
Breezy walk along the beach. Lovely start to the weekend. Must try the teh halia (ginger tea) & bergedia (mashed potatoes nuggets). Yummy!
It's a relatively large hawker centre. Can be confusing to find back your seats so know which store you are seated near.
Sometime the Abang sell the chicken is burn abit but his satay nice
"Mutton, chicken, and beef tripe and beef lung satay is great. Chompang chicken wing is also amazing!"
Haron Satay was definitely recommended. Meat is big but cost $0.80 cents now.
The duck rice is a must try.
Yucksss..careful when choose the stall..
always crowded. but a lot of options. nice place.
Variety of food to choose from. 1st time there ordered satay. Tender and tasty but can be less sweeten.
Always crowded. Nice place to chill out with friends and family
A good old standby with most every dish you need for a classic hawker fix. Nightmare for plant-based folks - but I was just here for the beer!
Relaxed and eat satay at hawker center near the beach
"Better during covid. Cleaner, less crowd."
extra stonks
"Used to be a nice place to enjoy the food and relax. Changed, now this place feels like newton food centre, filled with those arrogant stall workers."
Too many satay touts
"Die die must try Rahim Satay...used to sell at lau pa sat..the hidden gem..my number 1 go to satay with thick gravy,soft kambing and side dish got pineapple..yum yum"
Nice hawker food here
"Nice ambience for a out of a box romantic night. Though food prices are pricey, they taste good!"
Food here is good. But you need to get from the right stores. Mostly people come here cos they were at the beach and this is the only hawker nearby.
"Must try the prawn noodles if here, many choices of food, satay bee hoon , rojak, bbq wings, satay.. (:"
Waton mee... Always
"Wide variety of authentic Singaporean food, available at affordable prices. Nice for a quick bite or full meal. Known for satay and seafood options such as sambal stingray. Clean and tidy, many seating options available, friendly hawkers, and located conveniently in the centre of East Coast Park."
"Zhe Li Fei Chang Duo Mei Shi,Er Qie Tong Yang Lei Xing Shi Wu Ye You Bu Tong Dang Kou Bu Tong Kou Wei. Fei Chang Gua He Ju Hui. Mei Ci Qu Chi Du Fei Chang Man Zu "
The food & atmosphere is great. Conveniently located next to parking facility.
Gerek place to makan & drink
Love the food here especially the carrot cake and duck rice
The satay shop nearest to the beach - one of the best satay I've tasted in SG
One of my favourite place to buy food. Always something there for me
The waiting time is getting from bad to worse. After an hour or more no mood to eat .
Nice view. New Design FC and Delicious Satay.
"it's Monday  mostly off ,still have good foods with lesser crowd"
"Most stalls starts business at 4.30 pm.
The foods here was delicious! Local delicate, u name it, they have it.
Famous bbq chicken wings, wanton noodles, zi cha, fried Hokkien noodles, not to forget is the satay stalls.
Should make times to come here for dinner, then go to the beach for short walk."
"Just beside the seaside, food court Clean and food selling with cheaper price, so many BBQ seafood stalls and drinks stall.."
Good fried oyster
Amazing place for duck rice! Old school taste and worth it
Haron satay serve the best satay but expect the long waiting time
Overhyped. Dirty
A chill evening with Beer and Sambal Stingray.
This is a nice food centre in a lovely location in East Coast Park. Definitely worth a stop if you're hungry for something and in that area. It's also good as a meeting place if you need somewhere to meet in that area
"Yummy fried oyster egg (beside wanton mee stall) 
Finally managed to catch duck porridge, saw shutter down halfway at 4.30pm "
Can find many nice sea food here.
"The food is decent, some stalls nice even. Just that it is usually pricier than elsewhere, for the exact same food. Or at least where I know.

The place is really for the expats/professionals/basically higher SES folks living around the area. Hence my star ratings."
Pork leg best
"Lots of delish food here. Usually very crowded but due to the pamdemic and ban of dine-in, crowds are still manageable. Please support the drink stalls too if you're buying food back; love the sugar cane drinks!"
"Generally good food but very very crowded so you have to queue for almost every stall which i find not worth the wait. And when it's raining, a lot of the tables do not have sheltered walkways to the stalls or other parts of the food village."
Nice and relax
"The place is ""the king of Hawker"" for me! Lol why?

I have not seen so many satay stall and they grilled it in front the store! The Chinese food there as well is plenty!

During this pandemic, their business is not really good. So do go down and support local F&B!"
Hen Da Shi Ge. Duo Yang Hua De Shi Wu
Got our Large sugarcane here with lemon at $3.70 each.
"Craving for grilled food? Look no further. Come by the East Coast Lagoon Food Centre and you'll not only get great grills, but free balmy massages by the evening sea breeze."
Satay at its best. Recommended
"Some stall is okay, some is not. But overall are good"
Good variety food! Go early to avoid the crowd!
"Love this place for the hawker food such as wanton noodle, duck rice, bak ku teh soup, beef noodle soup , satay etc."
"Love the Fried Hokkien Mee, Chicken/Mutton Satay, Wanton Mee, BBQ Chicken Wings, BBQ Stingray, Gong Gong, Cockles and Coconut Juice! Tell me what are your favourites? Support local! :D"
Good place to be.. alot of food options and separate halal section..
Good food.
Not a fan of the new seats but the place is alot cleaner and more breezy!
"Busy as always even with the tightened restrictions, still lotsa peeps doing takeaways!"
Chao Ji Fang Song Xin Qing De Hao Di Fang!
"This is place for foodies this is heaven!!!in the east!

Variety here is fantastic.
Chinese to western to Muslim food here all have under one roof.

Cater to lunch crowd Mainly for dinner and supper.

Overall prices are reasonable not too pricey and you will not have a hole in the pocket afterwards.

Most importantly open from afternoon till late night for supper as well.

If you are hungry or craving for some good food come down already :)"
"Honestly, not the best hawker centres that I've been to. Only Easties seem to defend the hawker centre this much, but I was honestly not impressed.

The only stall here that's worth my time really is the Hwa Kee wanton noodles. The other food options, I'm very sure 1) there are more touristy touting behaviours than other hawkers, 2) there are better equivalent stalls elsewhere in Singapore, and 3) they're all much more conveniently located than Lagoon.

If you're visiting ECP and want some hawker fare after, sure this works. The seafood, the sugar cane juice, the satay, the chicken wings, the oyster omelettes, etc., all are good but not great.

But for the very fact that they're servicing more locals than foreigners, yet getting such quality for the prices paid, there's no real need for me to return here anymore unless friends want to come."
Wanton noodles is great
"Food village with wide selection of nice dishes such as seafood, satay, chicken wings..."
"I used to dine here occasionally. Just went there to order take away. Despite of the current covid heightened alert, there were still a lot of people queueing for take away. I guess we must all be craving the food there as always :)"
"I like to come here with my family. After dinner can walk to the beach. The food here is nice, but sometimes too crowded already."
"Best place to chill after makan beside the beach but adoii no wind most of the time. See beach pe must got wind kan ? Kan?  makan also sodap.  Price wise boleh lah..
Location wise ok la cause car park is near... so go lah try, bring your family ke, gf ke bf ke but no scandal, cause got cctv. Ok la I'm hungry again.. nak pergi makan!"
definitely a good place to visit and explore so many choices of foods . I had difficulty to choose the food because all the shop have so many delicious choices of food. And the price is affordable and the location is pretty good you can enjoy sea sight while having your food. My most favourite dish is satay and Chili crab with mantou a must try 
"Food is good but a bit pricier than other hawkers, I supposed for its location and view. But it's a nice evening of food/beer/chatting, and close with a nice walk at the park. (When it is not super busy or raining)"
Nice place to stop when riding East coast trail. Only take away these days during Covid lockdown
"Mei Wei Shi Wu Zhong Duo, Ling Ren Yan Hua Liao Luan , Bu Zhi He Cong Xuan Ze,

Support local during these hard times!!
Ke Zai Gai Shan Jiao Che Lu Fen Kai Xing Ren Qu Guo Hui Yi Wai Fa Sheng Zou Lu Ren Guo He Ta Jiao Che Ge Fang Du An Quan
"Good place for food and leisure, especially with kids"
Nice food but a bit pricey.
With CB2.0 it was not so crowded which I think it wld be on normal Sunday.  Not all stalls opened but enough to be satisfied.  Not sure what the recent reno was abt cos didn't notice much improvement except for new fancy XL fan that was 'upside down' as in not hung from ceiling cos was open air so was held up by a trunk like a tree !  See for yourselves and enjoy your makan cos still lots of satay and BBQ seafood + oyster omelette and hokkien fried mee etc.
nice local foods
A decent spread of all the local favourites. But a hot place on weeknights and weekends.
Big open air hawker centre with a huge variety.
Nice hot stone herb lala wine soup and chilli crab 
One of the  best braised pig trotters in Singapore.
Very tasty Singapore local food.
"Variety of food, my favorite stop after cycling at the beach"
Excellent food but seemed quite expensive.
Morning breakfast with delicious duck porridge and fried carrot cake. Must try!
"Definitely a must-visit place when visiting Singapore. The food selection there is tremendous and awesome!!!  There's beef noodles (gu bak kuey teow), satay bee hoon, BBQ stingray (*slurp*), oh-luak, Malay satay, etc! My fav dishes are all in 1 single location.

Already, I'm hungry again!"
lovely place to eat while cycle break
"Always enjoyed eating here. Satays, bbq stingray, braised pork trotters, ...and so many more. Good food, prices reasonable"
Class of it's own. Duckling rice and Char Siu.
Food is good but a lot of repetition. More variety would be good.
"Very crowded on a weekend. Took about 10-15mins to find a table for 6 pax (this was during Phase 3). We had multiple dishes to share (each ard $18 per pax). Stingray, Fried rice, sugarcane, oyster ommelette, cheese fries, sambal kang kong etc. Quite cooling depending on which table you manage to get. Parking is super troublesome here (do not recommend to drive here during peak timing)."
Great place to hang out and relax.
Wide selection of seafood but the price can definitely be better
Save together  only five a table
"Great food in great location, rare to see combinations like these at other beaches in Singapore."
Refreshing to visit once in a while.
Many good foods and nice sea breeze
Great satay and chicken wings.
Fresh and delicious seafood. First time back since its renovation and it does not disappoint! 
Madness sitting weekends
Very crowded everytime.
A good food market with a variety of local hawker foods for a break along the ECP route/path.
Nice food especially the black pepper crab.
"Good views, breezy vibes and great selection of foods"
Very crowded at peak times! Good selection of local food and beach fare!
"East Coast Lagoon is like the staple for all east siders, or perhaps all Singaporeans. Good selection of food, great service and also very clean."
"Di Dian Hao,Ting Che Chang Jiu Zai Pang Bian,You Xie Tan Wei Ying Ye Zhi Shen Ye,Hai Xian Shao Kao You Zheng Shi Dian Tan Wei,Ling Wai Yi Bian You Zheng Pai Ma Lai Can Tan Fan,You Kao Sha Ye,Ji Chi,Hai Xian Shao Kao,Ma Lai Mian/Fan,Xuan Zuo Wei Yao Xiao Xin,Bu Yao Kao Jin Mai Sha Die De Di Fang,Bu Ran Yan Wu Ke Neng Hui Sui Feng Xiang Piao Xiang Ni De Wei Zhi,Ru Guo Yao Chi De Shu Fu,Bu Yao Zai Zhou Mo Qu. "
"Local food on a beach. Great place for a quick bite or a heavy dinner with beers. Satay, popiah, delicious chicken wings, seafood you name it. Recently some light renovation was done."
Lovely to spend a hot evening with cold beer and good food
"Not really a place for lunch. Many stalls not opened for lunch. Besides being beside the beach, I think there are better for options in other food centers."
Cool Breeze and enjoying nature view ;)
Huge hawker center with fewer seats?
Lot of food to eat.
nice satay
After renovate d places have more shelter seat and very comfy.stall vendor majority is friendly.
"One of best choice for dining along east coast area. The upgrade renovation took place for several months and finally now it is reopened! However despite of cleaner tables and chairs and floor marble tiles, there's no major upgrade for stores or ambience in this region. Meanwhile I notice a slight price increase in some of stores not sure if this is general. Like a large sugar cane drink will be $4.8 and a standard size fried fish soup is $12. Maybe its only the shops I ran into but still this is one of best place to chill after a long walk or exercise along the coast."
Harun satay..a must try there.
Foods yummy enjoy
Little bit expensive for all items.
Always love the chicken wings here + plain rice
Always like old school hawker. No reno pls.
"Food there is nice.  After the renovation,  still as packed as before during the weekends and weekend eve.  But parking for cars and bikes really big headache as its lots still not enough.... Always.  "
"Quiet during the weekdays, crowded during weekends! But food is still yummyyy"
Soon Kee egg oyster best. Big big n creamy oyster
"Nice place for satays, bbq wings and oyster omelettes. Personally, I like the wanton noodles. Great place for dinner and a walk by the coast."
"Visit here during weekday will be great especially after 9pm. You will get seat easily but no so much stall is open. If you are here I will recommend you guy try lagoon popiah, their stall also selling fried carrot cake. Their popiah really nice and full of ingredients like crab meat stick, Turpin, carrot, vege and peanut. For the chicken wing, I will recommend Zhong Bang chicken wing. Their chicken wing is fresh and juice."
Food is great. Cheaper than Newton circles. And after a feast you can take a scroll at the beach. Plenty of parking space if you drive. Visit during weekends if you hate the waiting during weekends or peak hours.
Many choices of local food
Very nice place to have a gathering there.
"Heaven of satayy lover,fresh seafood lover!"
"the foods are awesome, delicious & service are very good but at times are too crowded...seats are not enough to accommodate people"
"Food is good, as is always the case for this place. Queues are expected, seats are not guaranteed and may take some time to find 1. Allocate extra time if dining here."
Good food near the beach!
"Quintessential Singaporean hawker experience, near the beach side too. So sensory, love it"
"going here on a weekday noon is a no-no. Stall owners keep touting, giving stress to the customers. The sugar cane juice here is very nice. Lots of variety of food to choose from."
Very good enjoyed the food and sugarcane juice as well
Nice place.for.exercise
"This place is packed on the weekend. So many stalls to choose from. It was hard to find a seat. But come here if you want to experience true Singapore hawker night life~!

Saw only one ATM but it was out of cash. Luckily some stalls accept Grabpay and other QR payments."
A lot of seafood and Satay. Very reasonable price.
Always very crowded during the weekends. So much about social distancing...
Love the Hokkien Mee. Must try!!!
Great dining
"Lovely place for local food and near the beach for people living in the east.
Bak ku teh and pigs trotter, duck rice, beef noodles have been around and famous on top of the usual satay stores chicken wings and seafood...
Can be a little warm and hot for lunch for people in formal shirt and pants....
Perfect spot for dinner or supper where you can talk a short stroll after dinner around the beach or even walk to the jetty (about 15-20min walk)with nice view and sea breeze."
"Come with my friend for dinner, seafood BBQ was quite nice and sugarcane juice also very good"
"Food was great,prices reasonable,nice ambience can walk along the beach with loved one or family after a full stomach but inconvenience for people with no people with no transport if only there is a shuttle bus or buses going in and out then it would be great."
Nice satay. Love the Jumbo cup of sugarcane juice. Bbq chicken is a must try especially from Ahmad Spring stall.
"Great variety of quality foods at reasonable price, look forward to next visit."
Almost every row of stalls are selling the same food.
"I dont like to specifically rate all but gotta shoutout to eastern red seafood #01-37 right at the end corner they are just amazing! Even tho i only order gong gong and their amazing chicken tomyum soup every fri (occasionally ill order the sambal stingray cooked longer to make it extra crispy!) with my fiance the gong gong is just sweet and fresh steamed to perfection, easy to peel from the shell and that creamy tomyum soup tho i wish for it to be abit more sour. Even gave me their namecard for me to order in advance since im always there late! Thank u boss ah hock and sis jolin!"
"If it's good enough for Edmund Chen, it's good enough for me!"
Great place for leisure and bonding with friends or colleagues.
Hard to get a table so come down early...
Bak kut teh and duck rice is good
too crowded and food & beverage price there consider expensive compare to other food centre. The amount of money spent there was equally to restaurant price
Lack table and a bit hot
"OMG! No doubt the best place to get your local delights. And if u can get a table closer to the beach area, you get great view with a beautiful view. What more can u ask for!

Word of caution: place gets mad crowded in evenings best time to go over is after 1pm on weekends and PH. But do avoid during rainy season. Limited sheltered seats."
Place too crowded and small... Its bad during rainy day. Foods wise ok... ok....
"East Coast Lagoon Food village probably has the best location as it's literally next to sea. Nice breeze to ""fan"" us as we eat the local hawker food. Although many of the stalls are duplicates, selling very similar dishes, especially seafood dishes. But why only 3 stars ?
Following the recent renovation, I was disappointed to see minimal changes to the place. One significant feature are the new ""umbrellas"" giving shade to customers from our hot weather. However, the designer has forgotten that there're are also many raining days in Singapore. When we went yesterday, it rained pretty hard in the late afternoon, but the new umbrella shades didn't help to keep us from getting wet. These are the most impractical & useless umbrella shades. As we say, good to see but not good to eat. I think the designer has never eaten outdoor. Everyone sitting under the umbrellas has to stand up to avoid getting wet. Really such a waste of public funds !!!!
East Coast Lagoon Food village has a good local foods, and lovely sea breeze, but don't ever go there when you check the weather forecast before going, and it shows that there'll be rain on that day."

All time favourite 
"Food sold here are expensive, portions are small and food tastes average.  I would only come here is I'm only at east coast park. This is just one of the tourist trap spot in Singapore. If you are looking for more authentic food please head to other hawkers instead."
"Still love the braised duck here, second best for me. The best is still Ser Kee Braised Duck at Albert Street Food Centre"
"Dong Hai An Gong Yuan Xiao Fan Zhong Xin,Hen Duo Dong Xi Chi Xiao Ye De Hao Di Fang,Chi Wan Xiao Ye Zai Chui Hai Feng San Bu. "
Not that crowded on a weekday during the pandemic period..But you will need to double check ur orders regardless from the halal seafood store or halal satay..As it either wrong order or missing order..
"This hawker centre for tourist that will pay a cup of sugarcane drink $2.50, foods cost expensive."
There are a lot seafood u can taste.
Parking problem. Alot of people during the weekends. Long W at the popular good stores.
Shi Wu Gui
"Wide variety. But found that the Malay Satay and Chicken wing stalls are getting worse in terms of taste, quality and value for money. Many other Satay stalls elsewhere in Singapore are better."
"Haron satay taste so good, but the queue is fantastic too..."
"Looking for satays,tis is te place,,from non halal to halal food is all here,always crowded "
"If you looking for a dinner following by a stroll around the beach, you should come here. Many satay stalls, bbq chicken wings or seafood hawker style, both HALAL or non-HALAL. I particularly like the coconut drinks. Perfect for the warm weather."
"Hawker center with a pretty beach view right beside a long jogging/cycling track and picnic site!  For some reason, you can find many stalls selling BBQ stuff, satay, seafoods and wantan-mee.  I would suggest visiting around 5.30pm - 6.30pm before the crowd to get a table, get a large glass of sugarcane juice if you are not a drinker.  The price for the food and beverage here is slightly higher than the typical hawker center, but generally affordable compare to most similar establishment."
Nice and cheap local food
Food is average but price is getting more expensive. Stall sellers are very friendly.
They have all kind of nice foods n drinks.  Go after 5pm and all stalls is open.
"What can I say... Always crowded, crampy, dirty, can never find a parking space, lots of negatives I can say abt this food center... But... The sea breeze is always so pleasant, the crowds are always full of energy, fun and full of joy and the food, many of which are great tasting! BBQ chicken wings, oster omelette, chilli peppers crabs, satays and many many more! Star, star, star star!!"
Very stuffy with so many people and not so clean. Almost every stall selling the same thing. Satay satay satay...
Walk around  the seaside and have lunch
Nice foods and very good space
Not many stalls open for lunch during weekdays.
Nice place to chills after long day at work. Lots of varities to choose for food. Recommended satay. Superb + juicy!
Good lace for local food. Good value. Need to get there early to get a table though!
Pretty good food but waiting times for tables can get very long and pricing can get abit touristy
"Zhou Mo Fei Chang Duo Ren,Dai Jia Ren Qu Chi Shao Bu Liao 300Kuai. Yi Ge Ren Qu Chi De Hua Ji Ben Shi Mei You Wei Zuo. "
OK Ren Chao Duo
More options and better food quality than newton
Wide variety of hawker fare...be prepared to get seats. Lorong 29 Charcoal fried hokkien mee is a must try.
"It's open after the centre had been fully clean n some slight renovation work

As usual a nice place to hang out"
Crowded and many standing around waiting for tables. Humid but good to be out facing the sea especially when the sun starts to set
"i really enjoy the fried oyster and satays that they have there, good food "
"Generally, the food here is NOT fantastic. Many satay stalls and I would rate them as 5/10 taste-wise.  We ate another dish, the seafood fried rice.  It was PATHETIC, sad to say (Malay stall).
The only nice thing about this place is its location....by the beach.
Conclusion: Don't expect too much if you're going there for your meals"
"One of the best and most popular hawker centres in Singapore. It has stalls selling almost all the famous hawker foods especially satay, BBQ chicken wings, BBQ stingray and sugarcane juice. They are all nice and cheap. Recently renovated, the tables, seats and toilet are clean and comfortable. Most surprisingly despite its location in a park, there's no bird infestation problem which is so common in most other hawker centres."
"Very nice place to eat, seats may be limited depending on day and time
Prices are relatively okay and food choices are plenty

Top recommendation to go with family and friends if you prefer something less expensive and exclusive compared to other seafood restaurants in the area"
I like to eat there every weekend.. Love this place.
Over rated. Expensive food
East Coast Service Rdcar park F
Newly upgraded East Coast Lagoon Hawker Centre with the brightly lit and very clean seating area...very impressive!!
Relaxed ! Multiple choices of food ! Seafood at it's best !
"Very crowded on weekends. Sheltered Seats were full when I visited, but there are quite a number empty seats with no shelter. May be good if the developer can switch them to sheltered seats as well."
"great food albeit a little on the pricey side, and what's not to like with it being situated at East coast!"
"Ample parking however it do get crowded on weekends night so try to be there early for my dinner.

After renovation, this is still recommended by NOC FoodKing Aiken Livestream March 2021 :) Hwa Kee Wanton Noodle with Char Siew Cha Shao Yun Tun Mian Stall45 is tasty n generous with the portion of meat at $5 (only thing I dont like is the styrofoam plate lor)
Haron 55 grilled juicy Chicken Wings, rem to dip the tangy chilli sauce. Sedap :)
Song Kee fried oyster Ci Jian stall15 is the yummy moist version
I tried the curry puff too
Sugar Cane juice definitely thrist-quenching on our sunny island

Heard StingRay Forever super good from Aiken n BKT n Lagoon Carrot cake so these will be my next try there soon

Follow insta ju.rine"
Eat here after going to the beach. Good variety.
Favorite place for great rojak
Good place to have your dinner here with friends after exercise
"Its has been renovated recently, its look cleaner however, it still super crowded.. so difficult to get a table... and need to clean our own table after others."
Great place to taste a variety of local dishes. Must eat here!
My favorite place for BBQ chicken wings at East Coast Park.
Wow! A wide variety of food!
"Many nice local food stores here. Can get very crowded on Friday and Saturday nights, so be prepared to wait 30 minutes for a seat. It's a local food paradise. I recommend you to try satays, sugar cane drink, BBQ seafood and fried oyster egg."
Very very crowded on weekends. Avoid unless you are willing to eat after 9pm. Cleaner will only clean tables if a vendor approach them. Can't blame them cos the place is sprawling.
"The place was recently renovated.  An improvement of layout and seats. Most hawkers are the same. Some have left. My favourite are fried hokkien me, Satay fried oyster, bakktu teh etc...."
"So much food to choose from. Had chicken wings, oyster omelette, satay and fried rice. All was good! Pricier than your usual coffee shop but tastes really good."
Average n popular food with averagely higher prices....
Great place to hang out and have a delicious meal!
"Stopped over for isotonic drinks after a cycling trip. Heard the lontong is very nice but only available in the morning of weekends. For weekdays, it's later in the day."
Nice result after the recent renovations. Looks more cleaner. One of our favourite places to go and take friends abroad especially when can't travel to Malaysia. Go for stall Stingray Forever BBQ Sambal stingray!
"Food recommended but, cleaners have to buck up. Yes, they may work by sector to clean tables but when other are busy clean and when approached by diners, they aren't helpful. Thanks anyway to cleaner auntie whom saw what's happening and help."
"Too crowded on weekends, don't get seat to sit."
Its very hot in the afternoon
So much choices and chose 4. Nice WTM and HKM
Nice place by the park facing the sea. Nice local food at cheap prices. Try not to go on weekends if time permits. It's way too crowded on weekends and stalls sold out earlier.
Great selection of excellent hawker fare! Love the Oyster Omelette and Chicken Wings!
Lack of vegetarian options
Great place to chill
Best hawker ctr in Singapore
Great food great ambience
"Not much difference after renovation
Good thing is most of the good stalls are still in their same location.
Hope they continue to stay"
"I ordered kopi siew dai from an Indian stall, but the kopi has no kopi taste and it's very sweet... :("
"One of the oldest food centre in Singapore that were built on top of the sea reclaimation land. Recently they undergoned a major upgrades and has opened for businesses. A very nice place to enjoy varieties of hawkers' food whilst enjoying the sea view. A good place to relax after your activities at the stretch of East Coast Beaches. One of my favourite food will be their satay. Anyway, have no preference though as it will be one of the stopover whenever I am within the area."
"Usual eating place after the activity in East Coast park, various popular food are really good, such as the fried oyster, hokkien mee and more. Be prepared to queue though as this place is quite crowded"
"Not bad place, really crowded and you might even wait up till 1hr for your food to be ready, but generally a nice place to eat and chill with friends"
Haron's Satay is the best
Want eat... just got to wait.. charcoal fried hokkien mee.
"Amazing food. Just after it's renovation, it's back stronger than ever! Special mention to Haron's satay. It's made fresh and super smokey outside the stall, they are thicker than the typical and are much more succulent. Best satay in sg for myself"
Still best satay around
One word for satay! Superb!
"Ok ok, the food not so delicious but the ambient very good.."
OK lah not bad
"Not much different after 3 months renovation
Nice environment by the beach
Varieties of food available
To me
The main attraction is satay

Easily 6 stalls selling satay "
The pig trotter is very nice and worth the price which is also reasonably priced.
Place is clean and brighter after renovation. Food is still on the slightly higher end as compared to neighborhood stores. Still a place to go to to find locally Singapore food.
Great food nice ambience by the sea.varieties of dishes to choose from.
Lots of different stalls and food to eat if you don't mind to spend a bit.
Food is definitely awesome..  just that it's too crowded during the weekend. Plan your day well.
Nice place for eating
More spacious now.
"Not cheap, very busy, not enough car parking spaces. Otherwise good location and decent selection of food."
The food is pretty decent for those popular foodstalls. The prices are somewhat expensive(>= $5) as compared to other hawker centres. Massively crowded during the weekend nights. Some of the cleaners have attitude problems and will attempt to dirty customers' clothing when cleaning the tables.
Nice and cheap.. Just take the small size if u wish to order more than 3 dishes..
The same tasty food is still there.
"Too crowded and very hard to find a table to sit. Food is so so only, price is a little bit over medium range."
"Delicious food there.Some are worth the queues.

Need to come early (before 5pm) if you want to avoid crowds.Would be very hard to find tables/seats if you come during peak hours.Long queue for certain food stalls.

Food there are mostly overpriced at $6 for a plate of Fried Hokkien Mee when you can get it for $4 at normal hawkers.Some of the food has quite an amount of MSG,very thirsty afterwards.

Many satay stores there,so don't advise sitting near them unless you don't mind the strong charcoal smell."
Good hawker food but pricier.  Sunday evening is super crowded.
Mostly changes to the dining tables and more accessible to wheelchair users (i.e. ramps) after the recent renovation. Some places are not well sheltered. But food is very nice and delicious as usual.
"The Saturday night crowd was intense and overwhelming. We had to wait for close to an hour before getting a table,  and then wait more than an hour for our food to arrive. We reached at 8.15pm but only ended our dinner at 11pm. And the food was only passable.

I would suggest going at a less crowded time, don't think it's worth the fight against other diners during peak hours."
craving for some satay this is the place
very yummy! new renovations are damn good! hard to find seats tho
"Always fun place to come.  Great vibe, great food."
Excellent stingray and popiah
Good food. Reasonably priced. Way better than Newton Food Centre. Watch out for weekend and evening crowd. Waiting to secure a table can be a challenge during peak hours.
For waiting was more than 1hr
"Place is newly renovated. Overly priced food with sub standard food.
Will give it a miss even if I'm hungry.
Do not recommend anyone who is hungry to head here for any food, with the same price, you might be better off eating at macdonald or even a restaurant."
Renovation completed. Fully open for biz !
Delicious lagoon carrot cake 
"Good choice of food and can take a stroll along the coast right afterwards. Only thing is, the location makes it a bit commercialised so you might not get the best quality or value for what you pay. Recommended regardless."
Food is delicious come again place
Good place for eating food. pretty crowded at night I don't know about morning.
"After renovated the place is clean & ventilation is good. But very hard to find a table here. Plenty of choices, we were order stall number22, food is delicious ~"
Hard to find seating .alway crowded
"One of the popular hawker centers in Singapore. Located next to East Coast Park Lagoon, with large carpark space, so very convenient for those visiting East Coast Park. Many good food stalls here so you will be spoiled with choices. Must try includes BBQ chicken wings, satays, braised duck rice, BBQ seafood etc. A bit warm during lunchtime but nice experience for dinner under alfresco ambient ."
"Expect long waits on busy nights. Long wait for tables to be available and long waits for food to be served from popular stall. Went on a Saturday night 7:30p. car park was full and waited to get a spot. Found a table at about 8:30pm ordered food, food served  at about 9:30pm."
Checkout Haron Satay!!!! Awesum satay babat and mutton!! Best bbq chicken wing!!! The ambience and the smell of bbq meats and variety of food to taste in the food village!  
Clean place
Opah Satay is still the best. Never a fan of Haron. No offense. Cockles was awesomely fresh.
my go to for beer and good food
Nice breezy place with lots of food options
"Lovely seaside hawker centre reopen after renovation and upgrading, so many popular food stalls with abundance of mouthwatering foods to choose from!"
Lots of Delicious & Affordable Food choices
"Will come here because it is near the beach. Lovely place to be outdoors.

Food quality has significantly dropped. Use of one time use cutlery and plates should have been reduced after the renovation works.

No significant changes done in the renovation as far as I can tell. Maybe the floorings? Or the roof? But no improvements to dining experience."
A good place for relaxing
Great food!
Nothing much to shout about. Just feels cleaner after their renovation.
"Hen Xi Huan Zhe Li,Dong Hai An Zui Da De Shi Ge. Chi Fan Bi Jiao Fang Bian. "
Too crowded and very expensive...some muslim stall there have very rude workers.
Had a sugarcane juice during pitstop while cycling. Prices have increased due to Chinese New Year. Found some new stalls since the recent renovation.
Always crowded...
Place is cleaner after the renovation. however they replaced the benches with individual seats which are more impractical
"Lots of local choices, but hard to find a seat during peak hours. If you're visiting this CNY period, some store queues can go up to 2 hours."
"Good place """" 2day was crowded"
Super packed! But place is clean and food is good!
"Very crowded during holidays n weekends
Food should be good. Did not find a place to seat. Should visit during off peak."
Eat satay with family of 6pax. More spaces. Satay was a bit expensive...very little meat on every stick.
Must visiting place in Singapore. Great place to eat and relax and cycling
"Always nice to come here for a feast. Come early though, hard to get seats and also long waiting times for food. We had satay, sambal stingray and also chilli crab. The satay came in half an hour, the seafood came almost 2 hours later. Overall a nice dinner."
The best place to enjoy..really I was happy
Awesome Haron satay and BBQ chicken
1 of the best satay in singapore
"A place where great memories are made in my life, 40yrs of families, parents, kids, grandkids, seafood, satay plus the taste of the natural environment the sea breeze, the sea, the sand and the sun"
Too crowded but tasty
One of the best Hawker Center in town. Recommend to go with Seafood and Satay. Excellent quality and taste. Just freshly renovated.
"We ordered from 3 stalls and the food wasn't enjoyable. The satay was served half raw, BBQ chicken wings was cold and the fried oysters had more starch than other ingredients.

Granted they just opened and it was very crowded, the hawkers had 3 months to mentally prepare themselves for a brilliant reopening. Sadly the only thing we enjoyed was the cold beer."
Love the atmosphere and food here!
Beside beach
Local fares in breezy al fresco fashion
"Can happily spend one day here with family, especially with kids."
"I had the most sedap delectable plate of pineapple fried rice my mouth has ever had the privilege to encounter here.
Pork floss, chunky pineapples, prawn, cashew, raisins...
Very Gao Wei, intense & rich & full which suits my tastes."
The ham and sausage was very bitter.
Not open. Renovations until February 2021.
"The food was great and the area offers a variety of food choices. The chicken satay in that place is very good that it kind of reminds me a lot of my home towns cooking. Many locals would just forget about how far the trip is towards that area, as long as they could experience the blissful feeling the foods there bring. Apart from this you can also choose to dine out and do picnic provided that you discipline yourselves and clear rubbishes after doing so."
"Always a nice place to go, but too many people during meal time... Sadly the place is close for major upgrading since 1 Nov."
It is currently closed until 2021
Nice food but poor sitting design by the gov
"Delicious satay and BBQ chicken wings, washed down with ice cold sweet sugar cane juice! Got to savour this before the place is closed for major renovations!"
Good hanging spot for local hawker food but too bad it is under renovation now till feb 2021
One of the best rojak... Satay is not the best but okay. Sugarcane juice is a must
"Awesome hawker at East Coast Park.

Closed for Renovation until Feb 2021"
Decent/good food hampered slightly by layout.
"BBQ Chix, Satay, Gong-gong & Jumbo Sugarcane Juice wz Lemon... Never fail me every time..."
"Really love the view, best place to hangout with your friends and family"
Crowded after 7pm always.. Need to build more tables
"Honestly, I think this hawker is overrated......... It's massively crowded and dark, I'm not sure why people enjoy coming here so much. If you come during peak periods the only way to get a seat is to camp at someone else's table (do expect people to camp at yours too). The food is average but I guess it still delivers a pretty authentic hawker experience and is a good starting/end point if you want to cycle or walk along ECP!! Recommend to come earlier around 5pm to avoid the crazy dinner crowd."
Superb food...gd environment...
Last days before they closed for market retrofitting.. delicious food worth sharing with friends..
Nice place to hang out with friends. Alot of local delights but too bad that it's under renovation for the time being.
The food was below average
Hard to get sheltered seat when come raining at that compound dining in weekend.
"Getting a table & parking is not easy especially Fridays and on weekends. Prepare to wait around half an hour or more. We paid $10 for a plate of fried prawn noodles - hokkien hae mee. A typical portion would cost $5 elsewhere & $7 for a beef kway teow soup. Food Prices are much higher here than most popular hawker centres, probably the most expensive. You pay for the ambience I suppose  being next to the beach and cool sea breeze."
Nice.. good place for seafood
super crowded as they are closing for renovations soon. great food tho
"Very nice food closed for renovation till Feb
Little smoky
Veryyyyy hard to find seat.very"
Beef satay and kambing soup were delicious!
Next to beach
Sad going close for renovation. Best duck rice Best braise duck and Best orh luak there.
"Well cooked, taste abit on sweeter side if u like braised pig trotter, the rest of the dishes is not bad too, can try the set meal."
Renovation soon.
Best chicken wings n fried oyster.
Great atmosphere and nice hawker variety
Nice food but difficult to get seats during peak hours.
Me & my family came here to have our seafood & satay dinner..the satay was freaking good..u won't regret 
It will be closed from 2 Nov 2020 to 1 Feb 2021 for repairs and redecoration works.
Nice place for family dinner with affordable prices.
Always here to eat and relax or to just tabao food. Can be very packed during the weekend though and parking can be challenging. Also do check out Stingray Forever BBQ seafood! 
Good place for Friday dinner in budget.
Relax place
Good place to rest and to have lunch
Nice food. Just a bit hard to find a table.
Variety of choices n its awesome
Public toilet can be improved...hope the upcoming reno can solve it
Ambience and food is good.  Unfortunately not enough sitting and air circulation is bad.
"Nice place to visit, but the food there are so so"
Its all closed only few shops open ...don't waste your time guys ...
must visit this food centre before it vloses for renovation
Crowded. All food stalls open for business.
Great food and fresh air! the hawkers there are really friendly too!
"Great selection of hawker, local food though slightly expensive. Cleanliness needs some attention though."
nice place gonna close soon thou
Closing for renovation from 02Nov2020 onwards. Upgrading work will take more than 3 months.
Good place to have street food. Have variety of selections.
"The best sea side hawker center in Singapore. All must come and savour the food there. FYI,they will be having revamp and upgrading projects from November, onwards!"
A food centre full of local delicacies. Very crowded during weekend.
"Nice food with affordable prices , while enjoying the sea breeze."
Simply nice place that must be visited monthly. Kudos 
Very difficult to find seats on weekends. Not baby friendly as not seats and bright enough lighting.
To crame...
Mei Shi Tian Tang
Gd food and place but too crowd
"It is nice place to have good foods and seafoods near beach.
And also you can walk along the beach before or after eat foods."
Alots of food u can find here especially satay lovers
"When come to eating seafood in Sg, it's always 'Stingray Forever BBQ Seafood' in my mind. Affordable, delicious taste, great services. Foreigners, Local & Most of the Muslim ordered their favourite Menu over there too. Their Black Pepper Crabs, Cod Fish, Cheesy/Garlic's King Prawn was my all time favourite. & Sugarcane lemon juice Big Size is a must to go along. Highly addicted to their Cooks!!!"
Very nice place to have sea food un singapore style BBQ with sambal and many more.
The food is nice but finding a table on weekend is abit hard
Nice foods
"Food court having a cross section of local hawker food  found in singapore ,, popular with locals and tourist. Prices are reasonable . Very near the sea ,  the east coast  . Have a stroll after dinner and visit the nearby bedok jetty."
"Nice place to chill with satay, chicken wings and beer!"
"Many stall to choose from, Chinese, Malay, Indian, Western food is available. However it will close for renovation from 2Nov2020 to 1Feb2021."
Nice place for sambal seafood on banana leaves
Food was great. Their svs incld peeling bbq prawn for u
super good duck rice
"Food is authentic very singapore favour, coming here is a good choice. Just that it is almost impossible to eat when its raining here. Most of the seats is outdoor with a umbrella. Operate till around 12 ish, so recommend last order is 1145pm-12am."
A place I used to go be Covid-19. My recent visit make me sad. It is so quiet and non active. Hope that vaccine can be out soon where lives and activities can carry on.
Nice local food by the beach.
over crowded. no safe distancing measures in place. over priced dishes. different stalls charge very different prices for the same dish.
"Loved it - good food, beer and sea with chilled vibe... I don't need much more! :)"
The fried mee & mutton satays very nice. Keep it up!
"As with hawkers on spore there are lot of stalls to chose from but the main menus are seafood, satay and bbq chicken wing
Can be crowded and you will need to wait if you come on weekends"
The rojak there is really good
Great place to get great food at great prices!
"Actually i DONT like hawker center, because in my mind ""Hawker center"" is very dirty place but reality hits me up I like the food over here, price is affordable and food is nice.
Especially the Wanton Mee, I like the most. Although the Char Siew I dont really like, but the Noodle and sauce are very tasty!"
"From the stall BBQ Seafood Kitchen was very fresh, tender and the sambal has a good kick to it!

Other must try -
Song Kee Oyster and Harron Satay.

Very crowded, be early to get a seat!"
Lots of food to choose.. best plc to dine in and take away..
nothing open
Great food. There is a Thai food store and the food are amazing. Must try.
BBQ food bagus
"Food here is still good, but it has slowly been getting expensive these past few years. For example, a cup of plain tea(no sugar or milk) was more than $2.50.
I hope it does not become like Newton Circus in town, when the locals were avoiding it due to high costs to trick the foreign tourists & rich expats. Better off eating at the heartland HDB food centres where the prices are reasonable.
Apart from that, due to its popularity, it gets crowded during dinners & weekends. We came here at 5:30pm on a Friday night & it was already 3 quarters full."
Good food and windy place to chill out!
"Good seafood, satay n near the sea ambience"
Wide variety of good food. Reasonable price. My go to place when I head to the beach.
Yummy duck rice. Cold sugar cane juice to cool down after a hot cycling trip.
Excellent food!
"Nice Satay and cozy place.
Expected long Queue on Friday night."
Really good food but there is so much crowd. Hard to find a place to eat.
Good food and buzz
Ate satay. So nice and nicely priced as .70 cent per stick.
After eat can walk along the beach or rent bicycle.
"The Thai fish was spicy, sour and delicious."

"Several good food stalls there. Such as the char kwey teow, long queue duck rice. Will advise visiting on evening time to avoid afternoon heat. Dbs atm available as well. Plentiful of car park slots."
Food fair nice
The food is great! Better than the well known standalone stalls you see circulating on the webs 
Wonderful place to enjoy a little seafood and seabreeze
"If ur seafood lover , must visit place . Try pepper crab ."
"Crowded and parking can be a problem, especially on weekends. Some good stalls like the chicken wings, popiah, carrot cake and beef noodle soup."
Food is tasty & aunty is really cool
Can get quite crowded but vegetarian food available upon request. Vegetarian pad thai and fried rice available at the Thai stall
"This place used to be a lot better.
Sambal stingray and sotong were good, not too spicy, not too fishy and satay was ok, but the otah and the chicken wings were a big disappointment: wings were undercooked and the otah texture was bad, especially for a $1.5 a piece...
And now that the seeview is blocked by a fence due to covid, this place is really not worth it. Similar satay/bbq wings/seafood hawkers inland are better options, with better tasting food, less crowded and cheaper.
If you really want to be by seaside, satay by the bay would be a better choice, at least i have not been disappointed by the food over there yet.
Having said that there are many stalls serving bbq wings and maybe i was unlucky, so i will try others and amend this review if i find good ones."
Too packed
Awesome food experience.. Had great food at different outlets!! Getting table is the challenge generally!! More difficult now due to the social distancing measures.
Excellent - best hawker centre by the sea in Singapore. If you're coming on a Friday or Saturday evening from 530pm by car please please park by the seafood centre carpark and walk the 200m. Traffic bottlenecks for the adjacent carpark are brutal.
"No idea what the hype about this place is.
Chicken wing had to wait 1 hour and the taste was meh...
Satay was rushed and undercooked. Better to just go satay by the bay.
The place is crowded with people that are oblivious to the fact that you too are waiting for seat and will be playing musical chairs with you. Bring your game on as the folks here aren't going to be nice.
Unless there is a zombie apocalypse and this place was the last place to get decent food. Am going to give it a miss.
Oh did I tell you the massive wait just to enter the carpark? You're better off just eating McDonald's as the stress you get is equivalent to the damage you do by just being there."
Pricey as compared to other food centres. But the food is not too bad
the food is nice
Good food everywhere.  Slight price difference but overall plenty to choose from and varieties of food... Good place to chill out. Beware during Ghost Month you may experience food finishing faster than usual.
best place for local delights!!!
Local favourites galore and tastes all locked in the dish! can taste the seafood and the meats well marinated and nicely BBQed! Yummy!
too many tourists tho
A weekend gateway to enjoy beach with various food options from Satey to Sea foods.
"Great selection of food, with a few stores that sell fantastic food."
Han Bak kit teah
Nice atmosphere but really dirty tables
Like seafood
"Nice atmosphere, windy sea breeze..."
Super crowded and chaotic but good food
Great place to go if you're craving for BBQ chicken wings
Better then chomp chomp
Just the number of options!
"It is definitely worth spending your dollars and cents here for both the delicious local cuisine and also for the sea breeze.

for those new to the lion city you have to try the satay, a traditional food which was introduced when the Indonesians migrated to Singapore in the early years. In fact most of the Javanese early immigrants introduced a lot of food including Mee Rebus. The range of seafood cooked in spicy thai or chinese local manner is also popular including the infamous crustaceans dish - Singapore chilli crab.

for myself Sugar Cane juice with a wedge of lemon is a must every visit to this hawker centre."
A lot of Power Food in this Area..
Come to stall 38 for delicious BBQ Stingray
"It's a pity you have to walk this far up the ECP to find a good choice of food at reasonable prices...something to do with protecting the established businesses...but worth the journey. Get there early on a Friday evening, you may have a job to find a table."
"Dong Xi Hao Chi,Chi Wan Huan Ke Yi Qu Hai Bian Chui Chui Feng,Xiang Shou"
There's a stall selling only oyster egg / fried oyster its super yummy
Touristy mediocre food.
Lots of variety to try.
Like The  Satay
Ok. Food quality got standards. Price acceptable
"Great selection for someone with GD..

Good Kai Lan ($6) and samba string ray ($10) from 37

Good Satay and not so good chicken wings from 18"
Too crowded. Food is over rated
Nice place near East coast beach to enjoy your evening. Lot of good food options .
Great food with great variety but very crowded hard to find seats at night
Nice open area and interesting
Expensive and crowded
"A nice place to have hawker food with family and friends. They have a good variety of food. We ordered BBQ Sambal Stingray at Stall 16 for 7 people and it costs SG$20. We also ordered the same dish fm I think Stall 25 (it is beside the Western Food stall) and it tastes just as good. BBQ Sambal Stingray comes in 3 standard prices - $12, $15, $20. After your meal, you can stroll along the beach and enjoy the sea breeze. BBQ Chicken Wings prices are between $1.40-$1.50 each and the minimum order is 3pcs."
Good choices
Nice place and good food
Food getting bad to worse at exhorbiting prices
One of my favourite hokkien mee stall! Always consistent n the .. yums
Food is nice more choice to select and near the sea.
It was very so crowded holidays long weekend good Satay n seafood.
It's as if COVID did not exist. Packed with so many people just like a normal weekend
Seems like a messy place. Has good food stalls selling great food
Best place to stop over for local food and drinks on East Cost.
"Great place other than certain areas are quite smoky from the bbq meat skewers. Great environment in the evening with sea breeze, try to find a seat closer to the seaside area to get more wind. Toilets much cleaner than 10 years ago and no more token entry fee"
"Good food here but quite pricey!
If you want to eat by the beach, it's a lovely place to go to...but we, Singaporeans, know that if you want good local food and cheap too, there are hawker centres around Singapore that sell these food too and just as delicious or even better!
So you decide the location you want to be in...to just grab a meal or go for a date etc...the choice is yours!"
"A great aray of local delicacies, especially if your looking for seafood"
Nice ambience
Good spread of locals food. In front of the seaside
rating are partially low due to close shops . ok ok la
Just a #simple story sharing session... Good place to try everything!!!!
Good food for good price. Can go walk at the beach after meal.
Overall wide variety but overpriced and mediocre
always love fast food they taste so good stop by on the way back from cycling normally 
"Food is great here. Wide selection of stalls. Worth mentioning are satay, juices, traditional Singapore fare, clam bee hoon, traditional BBQ chicken wings, carrot cake.
Great provided you can find a table to dine-in. It is impossible to immediately get a seating during dinner times. Be prepared to wait a long time like vultures. Or takeaway, but that would become a food delivery experience and missing out on the hawker ambience."
Go early for dinner. Reach full capacity by 6.00pm
One of the best food villages with a view of the ocean. Good vibe with variety of F&B options. Definitely worth a visit 
Different kinds of food.
Worth the visit. Price reasonable for it's quality and quantity.
Not easy to find a seat
"Great food, esp satay and hokkien mee. The stretch of beach around it is less populated and much cleaner than the McDonalds area."
"Great hawker, can be INSANELY busy on weekends"

Good hangout place but there is no option for Indian food . I hope soon they get some Indian cuisines ...I 'm sure the response will be great
"Too many people, difficult to dine in on week end"
Good place for dinner but very packed on Friday night and very cooling due to seaside
All the best food in 1 place 
"Some great food stalls here but a bit lack in variety, all sells about the same"
So expensive now
"Delicious seafood, but crowded on a sat evening."
Very crowded on weekend evenings. Need to wait for table to be available after earlier occupants finished their food.
"Love the food here. Always wonderful to be able to share many dishes together with the family. The satay from Haron Satay (#55) was excellent, as was the Macpherson beef kway teow. Come early if not the crowds will start forming from 530pm"
"Outstanding, good to visit with family/friends"

Ambience is the main attraction of this place. Food is so-so and overpriced if I'm being completely honest.
Good food....

Good food.
The seafood there never dissapoints everytime i go. Super delicious and very friendly service
One of last few existing iconic foodie places in Singapore.. awesome haunt located by the sea and truly serving local authentic delights..esp the BBQ seafood and chicken wings to be chugged down with a mug of ice cold Tiger beer..Bliss!

Still open during this covid period and still serving awesome seafood and satay
Food is good from Haron satay but thanks to covid there is a massive jam to enter the carpark as they blocked off half the carpark lots

Great food
It's a must go place for tourist who want to savour local cuisine!

The braised duck rice is great
"Nice view, good foods!"
Nice place
"Delicious, affordably priced food. Hard to get seats during meal times, seats can get wet and filthy when it rains. Be sure to bring lots of wet tissues and dry tissues with you."

Nice place for Satay and Seafood. Also try the Soup Tulang. Very good 
Good for food with families by the beach.  Weekend can be crowded with limited seating. You may have to wait for patrons to finish their feast.
"Good, affordable local foods"
Almost similar to Newton Circus but prices are definitely cheaper. Good variety of foods
A cooling place to chill out
Best Satay in Singapore
Lovely food and environment
Nice place to enjoy the food while having wind from the sea to cool you
Crazy busy and food quality has dropped a little since my last visit
This place is always packed in the weekends. Lots of BBQ stuff ....it almost reminds me of Newton circus ... Muslim food was fantastic there. Great place for family and friends.
Food is expensive
"Thich hop cho nhom ban be,  va gia dinh "
Satisfiying your satay needs
Great inexpensive food
Lots of choices to eat. Afternoon is best. More seats available and beautiful weather if no rain.
Rarely come here but the satay and chicken wings were good!
"Good for family gatherings, only if you love outdoor dining with BBQ. If not, do not consider. I recommend this place because of its good parking space and atmosphere. Makes you feel the kampung vibe. Food is awesome anyway because of the variety."
"Excellent Food to eat here, bring your family & friends , will enjoy the foods & sea view "
"HAWKER CENTRE PARADISE.
REALLY GREAT FOOD"
Another great place to get halal satay and barbecued chicken wings. Oasis Seafood has an outlet here. Fabulousness!
Nice seafood & you need hunt for seats especially during the weekend.
Lots of great fast hawker stalls...huge bathrooms and plenty of tables
Great food especially satay try stall 55  for good food ... especially if halal is a requirement.   Ssuggest about 15 sticks per adult and a rice cake each
Love this place!
Good food wth open concept dining experience cheap n good
Good selection of food from the stalls.
"Fried Oyster is the best! A must when we visit this Food Village. Come off peak, around 5:30pm to avoid the perpetual long queues."
Much varity to eat
"The food serves here is on average. Whether is mee goreng, satay, stingray, oyster omelette etc. To be honest, if you can get a seat facing the sea during, it would be nice but chances are quite zero if you turn up after 6.30pm, even on a weekday."
"Uncle Good service and nice food
Of cos still have nice satay"
Friendly Good Variety Nice location by the beach
"Varieties of foods to choose,  yet during peak periods such as weekends & public holidays always trouble to find a parking lot, even if we can get one which is far away from the foods stalls."
"A must visit Hawker centre if youre nearby! Especially must try are the satays, chicken wings and sugarcane juice."
One of my favourite place to chill
"Nice food at heart landers prices. Good crowd in evenings. Food varieties similar to Newton Food Centre, but cheaper.
The ambience is filled with oil fumes. After the meal, expect your entire body smells like cooked food. For hygiene reasons, when I reach home, I'll have a thorough shower & put my clothes into washer ASAP."
"Nice food, nice view by the beach"
For relaxing
"Love the ambience...reminds me a bit of satay club eons ago.
Will always head here for bbq stingray cravings from Musa Ikan Bakar & the spoilt for choices on the satay stalls."
Lieu anime et populaire pour du food street de qualite et peu cher. Proche de la promenade du front de mer pour une ballade avant ou apres le repas. Je recommande
"Yummy hawker food with great choices! Must try are Haron satay, black pepper crab and sugarcane juice! A good place to hangout with friends during evenings."
Should try the satay..after 30 years the taste is still delicious
Variety of seafood available with toilet nearby.
Very good food
"Too many disposables used. The satay, mee kuah and sugar cane juice were nice. Pretty much all the sugar cane juice are from $2.30."
"Good atmosphere for hawker centre next to the sea. Good seafood but a bit pricey. Has other good stall such as duck Porridge, Otah, Prawn noodles, Satay, Laksa, Curry Puff."
Perfect location on the weekend. Very affordable for Singapore standard. Large selection of different food and well organized. Very nice view out to the sea and easy to reach by taxi. Large parking area available as well.
Good but limited shelter and seats
Xo xo yummy BBQ set. Enjoy with beach vibes & delicious foods.Best recreation for taking break.
"It was the best place to have satay in Singapore. The view was straight to the beach so it was very nice to chill there. You can order from different counters with different kind of food and their special dish - satay. I ordered scallops, beef satay and coconut water. Everything was so fresh and tasted really good. Sauce was very good and I thought spicy sauce fit satay so well. Coconut water was not sweet but it tasted fresh. It felt really like summer!"

"Expensive place to dine out like Newton Circle.
Beef noodle over priced like all stores there.
Go to Berseh food centre.
Lower ground, beef noodles reasonably priced and much tastier. Check out this place they have lots of variety too."
Take a nice walk along the beach and come here for dinner!
Best place to relax but Sitting tables not clean on the food court
Satay stick getting shorter
Best satay in the island but the place tends to be very crowded over the weekend.
Tried the fried oyster (Ci Dan). Above average. Long queue.
Good Wan tow mee & cheap bbq seafood next door.
"Lively, lots of seafood, gud satay. Cater seats for big family, ample parking"
"Iam going here was closed, all food, not my luck"
Its food paradise... 
Tried Stingray Forever and Song Kee Fried Oyster. Recommended to try :)
Nice coach
A place to go for some delicious hawker food and enjoy a nice walk along the beach after meals
"Look out for stall recommendations before ordering! Some stalls are significantly better than others and deserve more patronage, such as stall 41 for drinks (friendly couple with good service and decent prices) over Heng Heng Coffee House (with poor grumpy service and they don't even sell Kopi C for a coffee house hahaha what a joke)"
Its a nice place to be with your love ones to have meals together. And its right beside the beach. The food are quite good too.. try it yourself to get the same experience..
Nice street food
Local food options that can never go wrong!
Food variety
"Eating out for under $10 pp, next to the beach is a great find in Singapore"
Experience the food stall near the beach is exciting.
Lots of hawker stalls all serving satay for around SGD7 for 10 pieces. Drinks of all minds available. Plenty of seating available. Nice stopping point on bike ride/walk.
Love to patronise this place for superlicious Satay Yunos 
Good food and the price is reasonable.
Nice seaside Hawker centre with lots of good choices.
Good hawker with plenty of options though many closed on weekends. Great spot for lunch after biking around East Coast Park
"Foooooooooood! Sambal stingray, cockles, coconut juice, sugarcane juice, oyster omelette"
Good food!
"Super good food! But very difficult to find seats, especially during dinner time."
Lovely place for dinner
Very dirty flooring. Place needs more frequent general cleaning.
Great food
Very bad taste
place is not bad. food is ok. price is so so. but try to avoid during weekends. hard to find parking and table. you eat there maybe 1 hr but you spend another hr looking for parking n table
Everything is good 100- 100.. Chinese soop is vet testy..
Too many birds flying in the area
Very good place many good food
Local food and drinks cheap and good. Best place is the fresh juice at the bacl of the hawker and you can't leave without having a curry puff front the back off the hawker too.
Nice place
"I wish Malaysia can learn something about this place. Clean and very vibrant and smoky. Let's not talk about the price, it's their currency."
Too messy and dirty toilets... Needs improvement
Lot of options to try from Satays to Laksa to sea food to tandoori..
Yume  food
"Amazing experience. The hawker street food has tremendous variety and a constant buzz of energy. Overlooking the ECP, this is a must visit for foodies and vacationers alike"
So many food selection. Good price.
A lovely resort with wonderful hospitality 
Great spot to round out the bicycle trip with delicious food and drink.
Wide spread of halal seafood
Lovely place
Cheap and good. Most of the shops are selling @ reasonable prices
"One of the most popular and frequently visited seafood restaurants(stalls) in Singapore. Suitable for inviting foreign friends over and have a scrumptious dinner here. The seats are always occupied so give yourself some time to locate a suitable seat. There are the halal sections too at the other side of the food village. Facilities like hand washing basins and washrooms are conveniently provided too. Food are pricey comparatively to other places but it is worth a try. You may also spend some time strolling at the lakeside after dinner, which will give you a pleasant and relaxing feeling before you head back home."
Most Satay stores are good...try Stingray seafood..its very good and not expensive
"Two words: Overpriced, No Taste"
Near the side fresh air
Some interesting local food fares/stalls. Very crowded in the evenings esp weekends
Good place to enjoy Singapore hawker food but can be very crowded
Clean and near the beach
Good supper place for late night hawker food!
Ren Tai Duo
This is a cool place to hang out with friends for food.

"We were brought here by our local Singapore friends, they rated it highly. We tried many dishes and it was all very delicious! I had some satay skewers, oyster omelette, bak ku teh, popiah and many more but I forgot the name. There is a beach there so we went for a walk after dinner to soak up the sea breeze. I would recommend to go early to grab a table as it was super busy. There are hand washing and toilet facilities there"
"Duck porridge is good, meat is tender n the lady is generous with the sauce. Always long queue during lunch time. Price average! Thai food and Bak kut teh are nice too."
Awesome pork satay
Nice open place for Satay by the sea
Very cheap food
Good variety of Asian food with a good view of the beach. It gets quite crowded in the evenings of Saturday and Sunday so be sure to be there before 6:30pm to get a seat and/or carpark lot
Lots of choices for food for u to choose
Nice view and good local food
My Favorit Food Place in Singapore!

Nice local food place
"Enjoy the breeze and seafood, satay, bbq chicken wings"
Workers and vendors there were friendly. Food tasted excellent.
Hawker centre on the beach. Large range of stalls with just about every local food imaginable. Very busy on weekend evenings so plan your visit. Scout for a table then get one person to stay and hold it. If you are lucky there are a few tables with water views.
Superb seafoods 
Another icon eating place to be. Always refreshing by the beach front.
"A bit pricey but if you're there , your there for an experience"
Beautiful and comfy
Foodie paradise
Excellent Seafood. One of the best places for foodies
Super Food-Court mit einer grossen & internationalen Auswahl an Gerichten. Uberdachte Sitzplatze sind in grosser Anzahl vorhanden.
Used to take morning refreshment drink during fitness activities in ECP. Very nice location with affordable price.
Nice food and scenery
"Food was dope, cleaniness was okay except for the floor"
Variety of food. Many competitive stalls with cheaper price and quality food.
Great hawker center for the beach and cheap beers.
decent food.. walk 1 round to check out the stalls first.. go there earlier on weekends as its very crowded.
Awesome place ... Tasty foods ... But less no of tables for eating on the spot ...
"Great food and variety of local specialties. My foreign friends love it here. Its super busy at nights though so it's hard to find parking and get a seat! Takes up to 1 hour! Verdict: go here only when you have some time and patience, since lines are a little long and tables are hard to get for bigger groups (4 and above)"
Nice satay.
Nice place but food is expensive and taste average only.
A place for good n reasonable pricing food
"Bu Cuo,Xuan Ze Hen Duo. "
Nice place for food and chilling by the beach.
Great place with many different cuisines to choose from

Awesome spread of hawker food to satisfy hungry stomach after day at the beach.
"Seasides hawkers. Food ok. Hot, not so clean environment. Transport not so convenient."
great food
Nice vibe and atmosphere! Plenty of kedai that suits Malay/Indonesian taste!
"A great place to have dinner with family and friends. But as in most outdoor hawker centres, it's really hot. There's lots of satay stalls and great seafood and many variety of food. May want to go early, around 4-5pm, dont bother going at 6 onwards, the carpark will be full and probably no seats neither. Don't bother going in the morning as most stalls arent even open. But evening time is where the crowd is. Great place great food but just hot and crowded."
Fast service but parking space is a battleground!!!
"grilled chicken wings very nice, ordered twice, must try "
"Always come here over the weekend to have rojak and fresh coconut drink!

The place always be crowded, good to buy out the foods and having it at the beach side."
"Food is great if you know which stalls to hit. Overly crowded on weekends,  could do with the option of having collapsible tables and chairs made readily available."
Camping hub & great facilities
Too crowded n no space on weekends
"We just came here yesterday,,,we just walking from tara merah to eastcoast lagoon"
Good place to have satay and seafood for dinner.
Good food. Always packed. Great ambience for a night out with family
"Overall fantastic place near the beach.
Food are good.
Personally prices is little high."
Really good for me cheap and best food
Good spot to have some food after running/cycling at ECP
Food is awesome as always.. but its a bit hard to find seats on weekends
Excelente calidad
"Expensive food, but good vibe. Hard to find seats at evening timing. Food you can find are mostly seafood, satay all those."
Enjoy all the sinful and tasty Singaporean food altogether in one place. Location is next to the sea with strong sea breeze to augment your dining experience. Do dress casually. No reservations. Visit during weekdays to avoid the crowd. Cost is pretty affordable. Parking is easy to find. Best to come in a group so as to taste a little bit of everything.
Great place to enjoy the local flavour of satay!!
Relax chill eat by the sea
Very nice location to chill and eat some nice food right next to the water. Possibility for leisure activities like bicycling or even trying out windsurfing
"Best seafood and crab.
Go on the left side when you enter from the car Park !"
Very friendly people in here
Excellent  Duck rice
"I love that its one of those rare places i can buy big bottles of Baron at very affordable prices. Foodwise is really super subjective. Just try! Its very affordable and local anyway. With the sea breeze on your face and food and beer in the belly, I am super forgiving."
Open air concept might not be suitable for rainy season...
My favorite to week and
Great ambience and
Best place for supper craving at night!
"Ke Yi You Duo Zhong Xuan Ze,Xiang Xiang Gang De Food court, Dan Zhe Li Ke Yi Xuan Zai Lu Tian De Di Fang Shi,Fu Jin Jing Guan Hen Duo,Duo Lu Hua Ji Jin Hai Bian,Shi Yi Ge Hen Zi You Zi Zai De Di Fang. "
Lost its nostalgic feelings. Food was just so so
Wide variety of food but not necessarily the cleanest due to sand.
"I like the variety of food available to everyone.
Even choices of fresh seafood.
If you are in the mood for
Satay, chicken wings as well.
Or noodles, rice.
You name it, it's all there"
Nice food.. a lot of varieties to choose.. only the parking lots was always full
Used to frequent this place regularly while growing up. Loved the satay bee hoon then. The standard has dropped since the original ched passed away. It is still one of the better ones though. Pity. Place is still a good foodie place especially if you know the stalls. Still worth going for the late night suppers that i used to come here for.
Good place to try local favourites along the coast! Highly recommended!!!

Cheap place to chill out
"Wonderful place for food. Was there this morning at around 9AM plus for a break. Was surprised that there is a Malay stall already opened for business. Tried the Lontong. Was good. They also have Mee Siam, Mee Soto and Nasi Lemak at that hour at that location consider very good already. This place comes alive from noon till late night."
Have various type of food and delicious
Awesome food but lack of cleanliness
Good place for cyclists to chill before or after rides along TMCR / ECP.
"Nice food, nice view"
Varity of foods
Crabs are the best at East Coast Lagoon. Just love every sea food special they make. Die Die must try.
Chope Chope is rampant... Stop it
"Good place to spend your time with your loved ones. The food is good, place is clean and people are friendly there. There are alot of varieties of food and drinks for you to choose. Not to mention they got alot of Halal certified eateries here. As the place is near to the beach, u can literally feel the sea breeze blowing toward you. A good place to visit when u need to have some short getaway from the busy city."
It was raining so didn't have a gd experience.
Good hawker centre with good local food. It's just beside the beach
The usual satay place and sugar cane juice
Having a big cup of sugar cane juice with lemon on a hot day while strolling or sitting by the beach is so blissful.
A place with good foods. Check out the weather before you go.
More variety of foods
"Best pig trotter in singapore. Large, juicy, meaty"
Only hawker centre that is a stone throw away from the beach. Where else can you have a cheap meal with a million dollar view!
Good environment.  Day time not many stores open.
Tasty all kind of delicious foods
It was nice. Lots of people want to feed you. Also very affordable/ cheap! Yummy satay
Lack of seats on peak period. Not enough light when dining late
Good food by the sea. Haron Satay recommended.
Good food and a nice breeze but a fair bit more expensive than other places.
Very crowd on weekends.
The food is nice 
Popular not the cheapest hawker center but good food and atmosphere
My first choice place to eat bbq seafood in Singapore. Prices still make sense here unlike at Newton Food Centre.
"Drinks are more expensive than food centre, almost twice the price."
"A must visit!! Wide variety of good food although a little more pricey than other usual hawker centers. However, location is in the middle of East Coast Park which makes it one of a kind."
"I like the outdoor atmosphere, but it gets quite hot if you are there for lunch"
Best! Love the satay here! 
Food paradise
Cool dining by the sea. Went for lunch so added bonus - no crowd - had chicken rice from Leng Heng. Yummy. Good sized portion. Boss is a friendly Teochew.

Nice place
Its a classic hawker center.. with good food and good atmosphere..
Love the stays stall..
quality reduced
Meal is nice..  Weekend can be crowded but gathering night meal will be fine
Got really good sting ray and butter garlic prawn from one of the stalls!
Alot of stalls and foods to choose from. But weekend is always full. Do come early.
A must go upon landing in Singapore
Favorite place for seafood and local delight
"There's plenty of stalls there but they pretty much sell similar dishes. Other than that, some stalls have overpriced food. All in all, the food there is great. You could also have a nice walk by the seaside after your meals."
Good place to bring your visitor friends.. localize hawker food
Great ambient to spend ur most valueble time while having a dinner with your family & friends.
Awesome selection or food and drinks
"One of the local hot spot for BBQ chicken wing, stingray, shell like (lala / Gong Gong etc) satay and such...always crowded during dinner time"
Excellent food all around and there are so many stalls to choose your dishes from. Really good place for Sea food lovers. Price is nominal and the variety and taste is excellent. Highly recommended!
Lots of nice local foods.
"Food is soooo good! You do get approached by personal from the shops, which is not so nice. But definetely would go back for the food and the view!"
Need to increase seating capacity
"The view was amazing , although  you need to walk a lot it's really worth it."
Top Essen ein muss wenn man in Singapur ist
For the lovers of satay and seafood.....
"My regular food place.  This food centre have a wide variety of good and tasty cooked foods. Remember to ask the price before ordering when there is no price menu especially seafoods and kitchen prepared foods. Some stalls pricing not decent,  you can order the same food on different days and price difference can be $20.00. Just be cautious when you are here."
Chao Di Dao De Nan Yang Mei Shi
"1 of the best Nasi Lemak in Singapore, at least at the West side. What's there not to like.."
I have visited this place with my lecture and frnds.  Good place to eat.  Nice Ambience.  Near to the beach.  Lot of eateries around.

"Be sure to get the seats near the beach, there is a great musician performer who takes song requests! He sings and plays the guitar with his percussionist friend on weekends! Great atmosphere to go with great food for a great family time!"
Amazing food available..
Lots of varieties...but dont like the tauntings
"Ambient, food, sand and sea"
Pricey food
"One of e Best place to bring guests from overseas. Dis place sells all e local favourites from satay to chi char. Strongly recommend e boneless duck rice, e grilled stingrays, chilli crabs n an all time local favourite is e fried egg oyster."
"Rats and roaches accompanying you for your meal, especially at night, is a norm and must be expected.

Sit too near the satay area, and walk away smelling of skewered meat and BBQ chicken. Price wise, reasonable for the location.

Expect to wait during peak hours, and don't feel shy to 'chope' seats with your tissue and/or umbrella for the full Singaporean experience."
Lots of choices of food
"Fantastic food, seafood, satay, fried chicken and beer. How can u go wrong. Choose the right shops though"
Food court by the beach.  Cheap beers and food yet you can really find a very tasty food here.
Got the good that I love to eat with my family and friends
Some place too dark
Love the satay!!
Is a nice place to have dinner with family n friends That is alots of nice food have a good time over there n after dinner can go for a walk at the beach
"Majority of the food are Halal you will find a lot of bbq grilled beef, mutton and chickens. Chicken wing is the most sold food but to my recommendation try fried egg oyster from Song Kee its tasty and much affordable. You may have to walk around for a while to find empty sit."
nice place to chillex
"Great satay , seafood and Chicken wings"
Cheap and nice seafood!
"Delicious Bak Kut Teh, Pig Trotter "
Good food options.
"The place is recommended for a delicious seafood restaurant and a good vibe. Located near the east coast and free, you can have a relaxing time here. Foods are varied, and if you want to taste original Singaporean food such as Oyster Scrambled Egg, you can find them here. The dining place also spacious, and you can feel the ambience of Singaporean life. Away from the buzzing life at the centre of the city, this place could be one of your destinations while you are in Singapore. However, you need a rented vehicle, Grab, or private car to reach this place. No public transportation is available."
"The seafood stall near to the beach , second and third last stall , offer very delicious * wok hey* hor fun(kway teow), ..fresh red grouper chilli fish..,2 salted crabs, broccoli with scallops, deep fried seafood cake.fried lala and chili cuttlefish..cost than $200 for nine of us. Best of it ..SErvuce is no. 1 ..( mo ta teng)"
Great food..Its open from12pm  till 3am
"Great place, lovely food"
Nice food... hygiene not as good thought
Decided to come East Coast Park for dinner as the team has sudden craving for local food. This is the only hawker center we love to come because the price is generally not overpriced. We ordered our favourite food from randam stalls and mostly taste good except for the satay taste alittle weird. Overall we love the food here and will definitely be back soon.
nice seafoods

Good place for food but is always crowded
"Good food.. But the place, well they should make up the place"
Abit dirty but have very nice food there are also a lot of halal food.
There is something for everyone in terms of food and drink. Make sure you get a seat close to the beach to enjoy a nice seaview and breeze.
Good place to have lunch and the environment is clean.

A nice place to chill with frens and family
Great hawker centre. Lots of variety. The Thai food is awesome. There are lots of fish options too. There's live music at the front on Friday nights.

Is a good place for meal either breakfast lunch or dinner. Also many varieties of food whether is local western n etc. Proce is reasonable...
Nice food but pushy drink stall owner
There's several different food and beverage shops here.
Cheap and delicious
"A better newton hawker centre by the seaside. With enough parking nearby and a lot of seating, the usual hawker favourites are more enjoyable with the sea breeze. Opens all day and late into the night -  best for a weekend with the family. Grilled prawns, hokkien mee and satay, yum"
Great place to replenish after a day at ecp. Place operates till late.
"Always a fave, good prices good food!"
nice choice f foods
Lots of iconic hawker food here
"Great place for lunch, tea break or dinner...u can find good varieties of food ranging from Indian food, Malay and Chinese...enjoyed very much the rojak...there r many stalls here that r highly recommended..the duck rice stall, char kway tiao, sotong mee, bbq fish..and many more...will be back there to try..in addition, after eating we can stroll down to the beach for a walk...great place and yummy food"
Great experience
Sea breeze and good hawker food
Lovely food and drinks
Ok. Not bad. Especially the  duck rice n Bak just tea.
"Location is good, for all. Specially for people going to the beach. Located at ECP(East Coast Beach) this place brings delicious cuisines u der one roof. Well technically it's not one but the bunch all together feels so. Must try - cereal prawns, bbq sting ray and a sugarcane juice. "
nice food... quite warm...
"Spacious, well located and with a large variety of food, it is a favourite with locals and foreigners alike. Large carpark is conveniently located nearby but you might still have to wait for a lot on Saturday evenings"
Enjoy place
The fried oyster egg and duck rice is a must have! tastiest local food!
"Good food here, recommend the oyster egg and duck rice, they allow dogs at the tables near the edges of the hawker centre"
"Reasonable price with tasty food. if you don't have vehicle, just take 10 mins walk from bus station"
Good food. Cleanliness is ok
Crowded but good food
"Great atmosphere, next to the beach!!"
Hen Duo Ge Di Xiao Chi
"Halal area is not clean.
Alot of house flys and smelly..food is not bad."
My stall no 21
good local food
"Sells delicious satay, mee goreng mamak and grilled chicken at an affordable price. There is many more to eat..."
Awesome atmosphere for local delicacies! Satay and BBQ stingray for the night!
A lot of good food but the place too dim for dinning.
Food for every taste and wide variety of bottled beer and cocktails. Delicious
Nice food and good view sit besides the sea side
Too clouded
Really lot type of yami food ...
Good place to eat variety of satay and nice view at east coast park.
Great food variety in a great location for a local experience
"Nice open air Hawker centre in Singapore. We had the roast duck (find the shop with the long cue) which was very delicious. The other stalls of carrot cake , fried quay teow was just average . We have sugar cane and coconut drinks which was no.1."
Best of Singapore food. Great value for money.
"You can find all kinds of food here, except Indian. I can't find any. Plus the food is good and cheap here"
good cheap food
Many nice foodies here.... especially reasonable pricing seafood
Good tasty food
Great satay!
"Although it was a bit far away, it's worth going."
Foods here no longer that good as compare to years ago. Prices still reasonable compare to Newton foods Centre
good place for spent a weekend
Delicious and yummy food!
Convinient to get to ample parking things to do after dinner...
"Fantastic satay, varieties"
Good variety. Make sense if you are at the East coast park.
"Love the satay, rojak and coconut"
Good food!
Came at about 5+ pm. Crowded but not packed. Crowd should be building up to 6 - 8 pm. Packed trotters and some sides and chow.
Absolutely loved this place. Great place to have dinner at the various foodstalls. You can have your pick of western or asian food served hot and fast to your table! Many drinks available too from gassy drinks to fruit juices and hot beverages. Carpark aplenty. Just hope that it doesnt rain whike you are having your meals as it's an ooen concept unless you are sitted in a hut as not all provide the hut as cover from the rain. Toilet is nearby and there is also an ATM if you are short of cash.
"Lots of good food here. Came here after work on a Friday with my family.

For bbq chicken wings, we preferred Ah Hwee (juicy with crispy skin and better after taste) compared to Chong Pang Huat's (coated with honey hence sweeter, moist and soft).
Eastern Red Seafood's sambal sweet potato leaves and stingray were great (requested for reduced salt as not having rice and it came out just nice).
The rojak was better on a previous visit (sauce slightly watery this round), century egg with pickled ginger (super yummy) with tau ka pop is ok.
Mixed carrot cake with prawns (preferred the white version as the black is too sweet for me) and popiah is yummy - from Lagoon Carrot Cake.
The sihum ordered from the stall next to Haron was overcooked...
Lastly the mutton satay from Haron was flavourful (and huge!) but slightly overcooked hence a bit tough this round as compared to my previous visit. 30 sticks with 2 ketupats for $22. Still a great dish and will order again."
"Awesome food. Stall 54(Rahim Satay) is the one you should look out for delicious and lots of variety of satay including prawn, duck and turkey. Seafood wise, i would recommend stall 56 or 51!"
"Had awesome satay 2 stalls after Sixty seafood on the right. The highllights tho is the seafood (bbq stingray and cereal prawns) from the Halal chinese stall along the drink stall where there's an olf uncle slightly bald, very nice chap who seems like the boss of the stall both mentioned satay and seafood stall is near the Aloha Sea Sports."
"One of the best locales in Singapore to try out popular local favorites like satay, oyster omelette, bbq sea food."
less people after 9pm
Nice food selections
Not bad la
Great local food for a beach park afternoon
Nice place to enjoy hawker food and take a stroll along the beach when done.
The best hawker
Nice hawker centre with a wide selection of food but most are average stuff.. very few are really good. Night time.. Better with cool breeze and the occasional buskers.
You cannot beat the atmosphere eating satay and watching the crowd here.
Satay haron 55 the best
"For those who love to try a variety of sea food, you won't be disappointed with thus place. A must try especially if you are a tourist"
"This is a good place with many food options. Not all the stalls are open even in peak hours, so there is a possibility of disappointment in food choices"
Becoming to be alike with Newton hawker center.
"The stalls closer to the main park connector road are nicer in my opinion, most stalls provide great service and superb food!"
"Like this place, come everytime we get to Singapore. Oyster and egg from Soon Kee must get"
Hard to find seats but the food are still the best and drinks are cheap.
Awesome place for food with the family!
I love this place. Lovely place with various food. Try to be there from evening to onwards. Specifically try to visit on weekends.
Go for Harun satay! The best.
"Perfect for unwind,stress relief,."
Delicious food but too many people
Good options.
There's heaps of choices for food
Food is delicious an the place is not crowded at around 4pm
"Nice place to hangout after biking. Get your nice cold sugar cane, seat near the beach and reflect about life lol"
Barely any vegetarian options
Nice place for families gathering
Good food with nice ambience of the sea.
Its a food paradise!!
There is no Indian n malay food hope they will be open
The seller is quite aggressive. So remember to act as if you are on a phone call when passing by them
Best satay
"Delicious and fresh food, with affordable price! Need to be there earlier to have your seat, and parking space. Better to visit on Monday to Thursday, avoid weekend!"
Very tasty food.
Not Good. Food not nice. Environment dirty
A nice relaxing place with sea view. Go in the evening is better as most of the stores are not opened. Explore a bit as some stores the prices of food is expensive.
Love the food from stall 38
Wow super nice food
Beach front dining with great local food at an affordable price.
"Good food, varieties, reasonable prices & good services"
Some of the best satay and bbq wings in singapore
"The whole place is messy but it supposes to be that way, there's lots of different ""restaurants"" to choose between and the prices are okay"
Sufficient smoking tables
Get spoilt for choices!
"Good choice of food here. A little like Newton Circle Food Centre. A few satay stalls, oyster omelette, Hokkien prawn noodle...etc. As it is an open area, it is hard to keep the place sparkling clean like most eating place in Singapore."
Go on weekdays best.Weekend is super crowded had to fight seats with many people
"Tbh i only come here for two things, Adam Spring chicken and satay. This is the best place to indulge and counter it with some nice cold sugar cane with lemon"
"East Coast Lagoon Food Village is the best eating place in Singapore.
1. Cheap & delicious seafood & other local foods. The price is a bit cheaper than the Newton food center. But this east coast is more popular among locals although there are also tourists visiting here.
2. The vibes are good & positive because it is near to the beach.
3. It is crowded but compares to Newton food center it is bigger. You have to wait to be seated as there are limited seats on certain days.
4. Quite far if you staying North & West side of Singapore, but near Changi airport so recommended for tourists.
5. You can bring food here & do picknicking if you want. You can sit at the seaside just behind the East Coast Lagoon Food Village."
Geylang 29 Charcoal Fried Hokkien Mee. Shiok and Nice noodle smell good. Sotong and Pork belly also very nice. Keep it up.
Great selection of local food. Down on the beach. Hot in the day....
Pang Xie Zhen De Hen Hao Chi Wo
No good.....noting to eat after 12 midnite.
"Cool hawker center in east coast, but its little bit expensive for seafood"
"It's the only eatery around aside from restaurants. Mostly lots of seafood, and other local fares, but variety not great since many stalls sell similar fare.The usual drink stalls but no more local deserts like ice kachang, ice jelly etc! Public toilet here was rather disgusting."
Family dinner...food are awsome and delicious. Satay...seafood..indian and chinese stall open till late night
"You can find lots of good food here! Sambal stingray, Bak Kut Teh, Duck rice is the popular choice in this area."
Food was amazing. Me and my family love going there and enjoy the food and breeze
Bustling hawker centre with a lot of local delights. Perfect for dinner after spending time at East Coast Park. The smell of roast chicken wings and satay sticks is bound to drive you hungry. Enjoy the cheap food and drinks here.
"You Hen Duo Hen Duo,Hao Chi Hao Wan De Di Fang. "
Good choices
Good local delights
Enjoy the ocean breeze while enjoying the great company with good food and beer.
Very clean food centre
"Huat huat seafood stingray is tasty. The sambal has a nice dried shrimp taste but not over powering, and the most plus is, the sambal is not sweet!! #yaye  uncle is friendly and this is his family business. We will try and review his chilli crab next visit"
"Great variety of food, if you want to experience the ""Zi Char"" category of local Singaporean food. But the seats can be a challenge during peak hours."
Good food and friendly atmosphere
"Good place, good food, little bit expensive for me, hard to find smoking corner"
Love this place and the foods
good bbq food
Very hot and difficult to get sitting
This is great place to know what the locals eat.  The food were delicious.  I loved they way they served the Coconut water.  They opened a coconut right in front of you when you ordered it.  It was an amazing tastes of FRESH cold coconut water.  Love this place.
Should try the Beef Kuay Teow which opens in the evening  only
Good variety of local food. Especially satay!
Most shops closed on weekend
"Bu Cuo De Shi Wu Jie Ge Ye Bu Shi Hen Ang Gui,Gua He Xiu Xian"
Hao Duo satayDang Wei 
Cheap seafood
Great place to enjoy local dishes
"I really love this place.. it is THE most Singaporean seafood food court experience that you can have. Being zero to beach, you can enjoy the sands and the water before/after your meal. There's also a sea sports center near it, if you want to do stand-up paddling or something liddat (as they'd say)!"
Generally clean
Very nice place to eat with family. Mostly focused on satay and seafood.
My favorite place to have a beer by the sea in Singapore.
Tonnes of stalls here but mostly selling the same stuffs. Near beach side breeze if you're still outside . Always here for the duck rice.
Nice food and atmosphere
Great experience. Good food at fair prices and plenty of seating. Bring your own napkins.
"Barbeque and seafood lovers place.  Satay, Barbeque chicken wings, cockles and other local dishes. Breezy on some occasions nice dining place for family and frens to catch up after a walk or run along the beach. Enjoy..."
one of the best in Singapore
love this place. Little ore expensive than some hawker centres but great to be on the water and high quality food
"Must Trys. Haron Satay. Han Jia Bak Kut Teh and Braised Pork Knuckle. Zichar stores, many to try from."
"A nice place with beers, Satay and variety of seafood. The place has a beach facing... located just by the beach."
Good place to come at night for dinner. Brings back the memories of many years ago when I was still a kid.
A veritable delight of food: we tried the famed Haron Satay this time round. Tender meat slices paired with a lightly crunchy peanut sauce. We thought it was great. Sugar Cane Juice with lemon in it was thirsr-quenching.
nice place!
Favourite place for satay
"Always love having BBQ stingray and all the delicious hawker food here. BBQ crabs, satay bee hoon, Hokkien Mee. Big area lots of seats but get ready for a skillful hunt for parking space especially on weekends"
It was great but not clean.
Sea breeze
Good enough
Local but authentic food
One of the local favorite hawker centers
Disappointed many stalls weren't open for lunch but a great venue anyway. Good facilities and view.
Most stalls were closed. Not much food choices
Street food
Good food but got problem looking for a sit and parking during weekend.
One of the best place for satay.
Best hawker in singapore. By far
Alots of option for food and snack during our cycling trip in ECP!
Nice seafood
"Delicious food, come during non-peak so that you can get seats."
Salted vegetable with duck soup steamy and hot .... very good
Lovely seafood stalls
"Great food at the beach, great prices"
"Very good food place, i recommended that place. Everytime i have on Singapore, visited here."
Great food. Awesome place near the place. Good place to visit if you like to eat street food
"This place is fabulous.

This is the CLEANEST outdoor food court / hawker center I have even been to, anywhere in the world.

The food here is restaurant quality, and the service is speedy.

Lastly, the prices are reasonable for a touristy spot.

A must visit when in Singapore!"
Foods good and very windy location.
Too hot maybe can install more fans
"Good food includes;
Satay (most store are good),
Beef noodles, simple and nice.
Seafood grill and zhe char style (check price before commits) go for the 1 with a Queue.
Chicken wings are all time favorite, but try the whole spring chicken which probably end up cheaper than having a mountain of wings. And the feel of tearing it apart also contributes to your satisfaction.
Go with a nice beer to cool off the spicy satay sauces and chicken wings chili sauce that's running down your throat. Non alcoholic go for the whole coconut, try to get those whoke green ones and not the pre opened type. Those are very artificial in its taste.
Sugarcane are favorite beverage there too.
Down side is the Q and individual stall have different systems. 5 star for standardisation of ordering and hassle free of Queuing and paying."
Hao Yuan De Di Fang  Yi Ban You Ke Nan Yi Dao Da.....
Awesome lunch with seaview
"I love to come to this place, enjoying the sea and makan makan."
Many choices of food with reasonable price. Super crowded and hard to get sit in dinner time around 6:30pm to 9pm. U need to wait for someone else table to get sit.
Good ambience and great food pick.
"Paddle boarding, Laser dinghy hire and windsurf hire available on sea front. Local street food kiosks close by."
There are available Young coconut and sugar juice
I can't really think of what to eat as there arent as much variety as before... This place is too commercialized due to tourists...
Great food
"Satay is so delicious, everything is so delicious , so many good food here ,  but here is so crowded "
All the prices are marked a bit higher than usual. Still good seafood and the HUGE drinks are a plus :)
Good food at reasonable price
Variety of foods to choose from and such a relaxing place to have dinner with loved ones.
Although price is 1-3 dollars higher than food courts. The ambiance is worth the price.
Good vibess
Love the satay with tiger beer
"Good food, but lots of people on weekends..nice area to walk at night

Came with a friend here and wound up eating some pretty good food actually.. however was best to find a seat first. Being we came on a weekend at night tons of people here however pretty nice area if you seat more at the end of the areas.. highly recommend."
Lots of nice local seafood mostly same variety provided by different stalls but the food is cheap. You can stroll by the beach after your dinner
It's one of those nice dinner places in the east if you're craving good chinese food or satay. The best part about eating here is that you can have a stroll along ECP afterwards. It's still pretty hard to come by public transport but it's still worth a walk
Great place to have lunch or dinner. Close to the beach. All kinds of foods and drink are available at a reasonable price. seating outdoors but mostly in shade. I had good food there tho seafood portion is very small. Recommended. Would prefer if they not use foam as a plate.
Another one of those late night places to get local delights. Excellent!!
"Nice place,  nice food "
Always here for braised duck and satay from Haron Satay. Both excellent.
"Need to try more dishes here, but had a good start with BBQ chicken wings.."
Lots of nice foods just have to find the right stall.
Foods are great many foods to choose.
Food is ok. Can try the duck rice.
Crowded and dirty. Food not that great either.
The tables were not that clean. And food was so-so.
"Too many food inside here, confuse to pick your choise... and crowded... averages is agood food, and good place for hangout"
Its a huge food court on the beach - The food is average
Very few vegetarian options but great for sea food lovers.
"This my regular area where I was
married life as my parent-in-law
use to parked his fishing boat nearby as we lived near village once near siglap telecom centre"
Nice place to eat and chills out. Do try the sting Ray with samba. Do go early if possible because it hard to get a seats there on weekends
"Awesome! Tasty food next to the lagoon, the beach, and a bike rental shop."
Best Fried Osyter at Song Kee.. Always Long Queue
Good place to eat sea food and refreshing brevareges
Dine by the beach 
Good local food. A good place to unwind on a weekend with family and friends
Nice satay and popiah by the beach. Other food are so so. There is variety. Always order coconut juice from there.
Lots of food and lots of varieties.
"The stall holders and their workers do not listen to the instructions of patrons. All they do is take food order and ask for table number. Request like extra bowl of gravy or extra lemon in drinks were not adhered to. Happened many times. When asked can send the extra bowl of gravy, they nod with ok. But never came back."
Great memories start here
The Crabs was delicious. Bbq Stingray much to be desired... rest of menu not tried yet.  So far 1-1 scoreline @Half Time
"Four of us went for the hot favourites this time, on a Thursday: Haron Satay: try babat satay if you dare - it's beef stomach satay and delicious: Lagoon Chicken Curry Puff - spicy! For my money, the best curry puff of this type in Singapore; Song Kee Oyster: quite a wait, even on Thursday night - if you really like chili, ask the ""chef"" to fry the oyster omelette with chili; Hwa Heng Noodles: sweeter sauce than at most wanton mee stalls in SG. The char siew is great and the noodles aee just right: al dente. Get a table as close to the beach as you can - we did."
Various of Hawker food
Seafood galore
Awww great place
One of my best place.
Too many people  hard to get a table.
crowded during weekend. hard to find parking lot and table....nice local foods.
"super packed on sundays dinner timings. food, hygiene and pricing is depends on individual. for me it's room for improvements as the tables looked cleaned but actually not cleaned"
Great choice of local cuisine
"Delicious food, great service, loved it!"
Crowded but good and inexpensive food. Ideal for gathering with family or friends after the sun goes down

Too many satay stores to choose from. Seating is limited due to alot having large group dinner.
Food is OK but pricier then other normal hawker centre. Except that you get to dine and drink nearer to the beach!
"The place is perfect for a local experience with a ton of options for seafood and satay. On a Sunday night it can get very crowded, and finding a table might take a while. But the food is served to you and the drinks as well so just sit back and enjoy the delicacies."
Recommend the satay here. Great place to unwind ur day
Rame dan bersih
Great food

Great hawker food
Good sea food.  Not a cheap place.
Must try the chicken wing next to sugar cane store. LONG QUEUE but worth it!!!! Best
Too crowded. Hardly find a place to sit especially during dinner time.
Great for family dining
My usual dinner place with lots of tasty food..
"Satat is gd at the Malay shop wher the staffs where orange tee shirt...
Chicken wings are the best at stall 14"
Great array of food! Nice place to go for the night winds too!
"Big array of food....go for bbq chicken wing, fried oyster....but becareful with bbq seafood stalls.....prepare to pay premium and super small portion"
A huge array of seafood and satay. And chicken wings. And beer. And basically anything else you want. Come at night and enjoy the buzz of local hawker cuisine.
a little disappointed that food quality of most stalls that i used to frequent has dropped
Awesome foodcourt
Good food specially chilli crab
Open air food centre with many local food varities
whole stretch of halal store selling satay. satay lover would literally go crazy over here. i'll say it's the most authentic and reasonable place to have satay here. Coming over during night time we can see the life and hustling of vendors and diners. definitely one of the best place in singapore to have food. and you can enjoy the beach breeze
Good foods at reasonable price
Over priced . Captive market. Dicerna of hawker centres beat itt.
Clean hawker centre. Best place for satay and chicken wings
"Excellent food choices..satay,wanton Mee, Mee goreng,keow teo, katupat, chicken rice,  sting Ray"
Great food at reasonable prices
plenty of large restaurants to choose from.. nice walk along the bay area after dining
So many delicious food for you and me  ..

Nice sinful food at premium price.though
Very tasty food. Great ambiance especially at night with the cooling ocean winds.

Nice Satay
"Delicious local dishes at affordable prices. Airy and with decent number of table n seats. Moreover, it's just a stone throw away from the beautiful beaches"

Love the Ikan Bakar!! And satay !!
"Night time for the seafood , satay , chicken wings , oyster egg , wan tan noodle and ChilLax"
Very wide selection of Asian food. The price is okay and the ambiance is perfect. Will be coming back here soon.
Great place to eat.
Good and cheap food
Try the stingray menus. It was great
Food choices vary .
Great option for a lunch stop in East coast park. Curry puffs are a must try!
Excellent outdoors food hall on the beach. Great selections of foods and drinks. Typical Singapore hawker center on the water.
Lots of variety can satisfy what ever you are craving for
Wonderful food
Crowded and hard to find a table during the dinner peak period around 7pm. Good range of local food.
Not value for money. Super crowded and the food quality is average.
Always here for satay and seafood. Parking can be difficult
Great experience but wouldn't recommend a Saturday evening.. Absolutely crammed and really hard to get a table.. BBQ stingray is sensational and worth the wait
Fantastic seafood at a fantastic price!
"If you want a good satay, just go to this place."
Great outdoor food. More local than Newton
A little on the pricey side but the food is amazing so it's worth. Atmosphere is great too!
Too overcrowding at peak time for dinner and car parking problem. Hard to get there unless you have own transportation. Worst case if rain comes by follow up with gust of winds.
Nice local food with reasonable price
"Wide variety of good food, drinks and desserts. Comfortable environment but has it's fair share of flies and mosquitoes. Great place to chill and have a meal."
Most of the local food can be found here. Parking will be difficult during Friday and weekend night.

"Reminder, it doesnt open so early in the morning."
Good to eat and walk
Nice place for family to walk and gathering
"Taste of the food are very standard,  price is not cheap comparing to the quality, but they decorate the place well, you can walk to the beach after eating"
Very good place for eating all kind of foods
Had satay and hokkien mee. Yummy! Many satay stalls to choose from. I prefer the Malay satay stalls - their beef sticks are good! Gets crowded though so you have to split up to look for seats. Live music in the part near the jogging pathway. Give him a tip!
Food very nice
"Well known places among many for local delights. The only downside is that it's very crowded, so it may take while to find a seat."
"Overall price $50 excluding sugar cane drinks, for 4 pax I would say it's pretty decent cheap & fulfilling meal. Sting ray is a definitely must order dish when you're there, pork rib is definitely worth spending, hardly could find such fresh and tender pork & sting ray, as of etc basically overall very satisfied. (Blue Color Signboard Seafood Chinese Stall At The End Corner) It's called *BBQ SEAFOOD KITCHEN* If I'm not mistaken, especially the Aunty very kind & friendly enough to cook the lady finger with fried sambal upon our request ""It's Off The Menu"". Appreciate It! I've tried other dishes on the menus too. Won't Be Disappointed, Can Thank Me Later!"
Good foods
"Satay and Barbecued Chicken Wings is nice, food stall people is friendly. Awesome food and place."
Great vibes!
"I love this Hawker centre.
This is the my best one ;-)"
If u got nothing to do go to the beach for a stroll ....when hungry catch some local food like noodles ...chicken rice n Satay.
"Ate satay at Ahmad Spring. Very good satay and sauce. Very good service, polite and friendly"
Great place
Very nice scenary with yammy food to eat
Go there for the best satay at Haron satay
Good food good environment

Best Satay club
The best chicken rice in Singapore!
Can't find healthy food
"Great food, absolutely wonderful ambience. Nice place to eat some of Singapore's famous hawker fare."
"Food is nice, but very hot"
Feng Fu Duo Yang Hua Xuan Ze De Mei Shi Zhong Xin!Kan Zhu Ren Chao Gen Zhu Pai Dui Huo Kan Zhao Pai You De Jiang Jiu Bu Hui Cuo Liao ~
Place is dirty. A lot of house fly.
"My favourite hawker centre in Singapore. Always a crowd whenever I go, especially during Friday and weekend evenings, so usually have to wait a bit to get a free table. The fried oyster from Song Kee Fried Oyster (01-15) and chicken wings from Ah Hwee (01-14) are some of the must haves. The seafood and satay are great too."
Great variety.  Very nice food stall people.  They try to draw you in to look at the menu but aren't pushy if you move on.
Now cleaner than last time. Food still good.
100% Amstel Radler. Made with from HEINIKEN's recipe 
Great chilli crab
Food is very nice and good ambiance of east coast beach
satisfying
wow food fantastic and with good Singaporian friends
Great food
"Fried Hokken prawn made was a bit too salty,but generally good taste with reasonable price comparing eating in the city area.
Other than that,the popiah eating here was really tasty! The best in Singapore as for now.
Really recommendable.
I'm sure this has become one of my must-eat food when I drop by this food center."
Food not bad
Lots of food but needs a bit of cleaning up.
Visit before peak hours to get good food and also the breeze.
The kway teow goreng is so dull and salty. I cant have peace eating here coz so many aunties selling tissue and keychain etc. Lots of caterpillar crawling around coz its after rain.
"Great place, Great food, can be really packed  over weekends."
Lots of food
"Good variety of food, quality is great too"
"There are a variety of different kinds of food to choose from, and there must be one that will satisfy you."
"Convenient food oasis at affordable prices, right by the sea"
A variety of food stalls are available. Seating area is better than other Hawker Centres. Opens from 5pm till midnight. And also the street music performers are there.
Pricey. Can only recommend the teh tarik at this food stall. Absolutely good! Some of the best I've tasted in SG thus far! (Big teh tarik fan here!)
Lots of seafood stall to choose from
Lots of different choices for you to choose from
Food n drinks expensive by hawker food std
Not so much your regular hawker centre mix but rather a focus on bbq and satay which is great if you are just by the beach. Not the place to order chye peng!
Good braised duck
Good place
"Only heaty food like satay, grilled fish etc. The normal hawker food is not sold there."
Many choices of local seafoods & can drink beer ... 
Lovely hawker center by the beach. They have a huge selection of good quality local fare. I especially enjoy the porridge/congee shop.
"What can I say? A MUST visit to try our local delicacies. From the Satay, Popiah, Carrot cake, to the Chicken Wings, Rojak and Oyster omelette! This place is also a frequent visit by the locals too."
Good food. Especially the chilli crab... Yummy!!!
If you are talking about hawker centre or food court this is the best Singapore have. Amazing food and great ambience.
Most of the food sold at the location is very good
"Beef noodles, satay, seafood, sugar came drinks, etc etc. Lots to eat.

Omg it's so hot out here in the afternoon. Please try to come earlier or after 5pm."
Fantastic street food!
A foodie heaven !
Satay and lala top notch
A large variety of food with reasonable pricing and service (totally not expected)
IF you do not mind the afternoon heat and the humidity this is a great place to chill and to have a good meal. The pig trotters and teh terik always make my day.
A good place to rent and ride bicycle
Uncountable number of choices
Great stingray!
Can get really crowded during weekends or holidays but the best satay n wings for my cravings
This is the full of tasty food place in Singapore....
Good & affordable food by the beach
Lots of options for local food. Do beware of touting though.
"More of a evening and night eating place , weekdays not many stores opened, weekends quite bustling.
Humid and hot here in April .."
Crowded on weekends..
Good satay place! Affordable pricing
Many choices.
Not really good taste but oke lah
Delightful
Nice place... A lot of eastern and western food
Packed during night time
"Lots of nice shop service a traditional Asian street food with self serving and economic price
Grab a wipe tissue to clean hands after eating "
Too crowded specially on weekends took us more than half an hours to get the table.  The food was okay.
"Good food.. but if you go during noon time, please prepare to bear the heat..."
"Great food, cheap prices, nice ambiance. Very close to the Wakeboard Park and the Xtreme skatepark, and there's a beach across the walking path, and great for biking or rollerblading along the beach."
The satay here are incomparable! Nice and will keep coming back!!
Best remembrance outing with wife long time ago...was done today...
Food paradise by the beach
"Been to this place probably over a hundred times. I have been coming here since I was a kid. Definitely a good place for anybody craving for seafood, coconut juice or satay as this is what this place specializes in. Whilst some may say this place is often crowded and unhygienic due to food often leaving the tables stained caused by the huge waves of crowds in contrast to the lack of cleaners around which is understandable, but nonetheless it is without a doubt one of the best places to get some proper local satays and seafood cuisine. And just to add some assurance, I have never had a bad stomach from eating here. Ever."
Many good foods
Super Place for Chinese food
"This is one of the place that I love to go with my friend, not only the food is good, also you can sit and enjoy the sunset and the breeze from the ocean... very relaxing."
Amazing atmosphere and great food! Definitely worth a visit and try the fried oysters!
Great food
Very convenient and welcoming place for family time at ECP
Unbelievably good food. A must visit. The chilli crab is heavenly
"Coconut drink, seafood , satay, chinese food, Malay Food, Beer, cold can drink, you name it they have it. East coast is a nice beach, while East Coast Lagoon food centre is affordable nice beach stop by to fill up your stomach with Good Food. For local taste and affordable price you may come here"
Awesome location by the water.  Very busy on weekends.  Best satay in Singapore at Haron 30 IMHO!
Good place for supper after 12!!!
Lots of food near the beach
Mc is worth trying and a leasure place
"A lot of variety of food here with a beautiful setting overlooking the ocean.

I've heard the best chilli mud crab is from here. Check it out"
Good bbq stuff.
My favorite hawker. At the beach and no tourist rip off prices
Best satay in SG.
Nice place.
Place to chill & have some Satays 
"Rather crowded on weekends and can be hard to find seats. Jumbo size sugar cane drinks is a must on a hot afternoon! Many options of seafood, satay and bbq chicken wings. Recommend the boiled blood clams (si ham)! Food quality is average hawker food but location beats all.

Carpark is almost always crowded on weekend. There is a nearby bicycle rental shop.  Not baby friendly."
Great food. Good place for friends gathering.
waiting for chair more than half hour
The food and drinks there are so tasty! The spread is great! Though the place is often very crowded and usually some time is needed to find a table to seat at and to queue and order food and drinks.
Arrived nothing is opened. Only functions at night. Day time empty. Sucks
"Food is tasty and have a lot of options including sate, ayam bakar, kari puff, Chinese food n etc. I do love to drink again the sugar cane drink for 3$. It's large n worthy."
"Nice atmosphere, good food but need to go earlier to chope seats; if not will be too crowded."
"Alot of food very nice, but no baby chair"
Good selection of quality food. Just watch for the crowd during peak hours.
Love the chilli crab!!!!

Its really crowded on weekend nights
"Yummy satay in casual settings.
The beach view makes dining here a relaxing one"
"Excellent cycling session, and pleasant view with local foods"
Awesome food. Never a let down. Try their sambal sting ray with a bottle of cold beer. After a few miles of run or biking this is the place to be to energize.
"Lovely place, nice beach"
"Hen Gua He Zuo Xia Lai He Peng You Liao Tian De Di Fang,
Kao Ji Chi Pei Gan Zhe,Zai Lai Yi Xie Ben Di Hai Xian Liao Li,
Chi Bao Ke Yi San San Bu. "
Nice local food. Many nice stalls and variety. Good for all occasions.
"A local favourite with good food, just next to the beach and reasonable price compared to some tourist hawkers centre in town. Sells beer and bottled imported beer as well if you explore all the drinks stall. There are Chinese food, Muslim food, Thai food and Indian food as well. Highly recommended to go in the evening when the sun goes down as it us alfresco"
Good food but very crowded
Heaps of local varieties. Wish I hv a bigger stomach
Too crowded. Seat turnover slow
"After so many years it still feels good coming to this place, thou I believe food can be better giving at that price range."
"What else can I say? Great food all the time. Only con is I wouldn't recommend to drive there during peak period as parking lots is always in low supply. If you don't mind walking a little bit, there are always more parking lots further up from this location."
"Come here during the evening for the local food experience and enjoy a stroll at East Coast Park. I recommend trying BBQ sting ray, BBQ chicken wings, satay and fried carrot cake. For drinks, do get a cup of Sugar Cane so that you can fully emerse yourself into local culture. Additionally, this is one of the scenes in Crazy Rich Asian."
Nice bbq chicken from ah wee
Large selection of hawkers fare
"Wish there was a greater variety of food here, especially on weekdays when most of the stalls are closed. But it's a great place for a hearty meal nonetheless."
Choice of food with awesome beach view
"Good sea foods, yummy satay, good sea view, reasonable beer price. Just if you don't have own transport, make sure your hand phone to look for Grab."
A variety of food with reasonable price. Sea view is amazing during Sunset.
Great food great ambience!
"Standard hawker food, do try those stalls with long queues, as this means that they are nice. Han Jia Bak Kut Teh is  a must try for their braised fatty pig trotters. Can have a leisurely stroll along the beach before and after your meal."
"It's very crowded place with so-so food. Need to run around for over 30' just for looking for a table, real nightmare, will not visit next time."
"Decent and Quality Food! But finding a table is the only pain, avoid weekend evenings."
many food to eatand relax
Great family friendly place to go and spend the day.
"This is a great place to bring family for beach activities and meals. If you love outdoor dining, you must visit this place. Parking during weekends can be a bit challenging."
A good hangout place with great food selection.
Very crowded but good place for nights. Lots of options for food and beverages
always visit this place for duck rice and thai food during lunch hours. at night will be the salted vegetable duck soup. super yummy
Good place to eat almost everything delicious in SG.
Enjoy the beach with the food . Got many food centres to choose from.. Try Satay for sure.
"So many type of food There, like as Indin Muslim, Korean,  Japanese,  Thai, Malaysians food Available."
"First timer here after many times visiting SG.
The options is a lot and tasty. Tried at the Halal one started with sea food and it is awesome!
Will be back again to find other food!
Absolutely recommended food in here to try!"
Nice spot to rest and cool down
Highly recommended
A nice place for a good meal by the beach.
"Average food, average price for the location.  Very smoky due to many satay sellers"
average food quality
"Zhe Bian Shao Kao Yu,Rou He Yang Rou Du Hao Chi"
"I can see the attempts at trying to replicate the old Satay Club in Padang. Unfortunately, it falls short, in my opinion. The food my family and I ate was nothing compared to the former, not to mention the expensive prices.
I thought the long wait was worth it, but it wasn't.
Anyways, this is simply my opinion and experience. Others may feel otherwise and they surely are welcome to them.
Fortunately for me, the family outing was saved by the after-dinner walk along the beach."
Many choice there. Too much to mention
Only one stall can eat... Is the pig trotter
"Quite spacious, with hawker foods and seafood.. near the beach. But closes quite early."
I visited this place around 1 p.m. Just few restaurants were open at that time. I think you had better visit  at night. 'Sugar cane juice ' was good try to drink. They charged 3 and half dollars. It was good  for us since we never been drank this kind of juice.
Very seafood restaurant to entertain both local and foreign visitors
"My family favourite place to get our seafood fix. Nice ambience near the beach, easy washing point nearby. Night time no birds and bugs. 100% will bring foreign friends."
"No good when it rains, the seats are ALL WET. NO COVER. NO LINK FROM STALLS to our seats. The management gives a deaf ear to this issue for number of years.??? This is also a TOURIST ATTRACTION place!!!"
No shelter to shower area..
Run of the mill hawker center.
Good casual food near the beach
It's a wow place. Great food all around but the best being Satay. Good price and tasty.
"Foods good, notably satay. ATM access. Teh comes in large serving portions. Lots of seating in and around the area. Decent spot for pogo. 4 star, 2 different places didn't get the correct order."
bright and breezy place this sat morning.
Quite touristy and busy place. Prices higher than in other hawkers but the seaview makes up for it
Very busy so need to be aware that you may have to wait for table (but worth it!)
"It's a nice place to have a meal with friends. Food quality is good, and the place is well-kept and clean. Price is pretty ok. However it seems like there're many stalls selling the same things... and although there're many stalls, there isn't really a wide variety of local hawker food..."
Good ambience...good food. Has maintained high standard for the last 40 years. Hope it always maintain the same in the next 40 years
Good place to grab a bite or a drink
Great place to hang out in week nights and weekends. The breeze is always goood and there's a wide selection of loval food to choose from.

"Good street music
Fresh air
Good beer

Food is not so safe, box using recycled plastic- no good for environment and health

Very crowded can not have table and take lot of time to order food or drinks"
"Good food, but mostly at night"
Great place to to visit with family and friends
Lots of great local food to try.
Casual seaside hawker
Best Carrot Cake.
Wide range of local Singapore food.
"Lots of satay stores, but they're all about the same. Might wanna ask to try the sauce first though, some of them have different tasting sauces, so that might tip the scales for you."
"On the first day of CNY 2019, I and my family's we went for dinner. We had choose the OCEAN MUSLIM SEAFOOSEAFOOD'S to full our empty stomach. Unfortunately, after the foods were served and after we kick start consuming the food, we begun to realised that the taste was so damn horrible......

Nevertheless, my family's were so  unfortunated today and rest assured that we will not gonna patronise the seafood stall again."
Recommended for family bonding but required patience as always full house
Very busy and food is nice. Easy to find
"Lots of seafood, great view of the sea. Only vegetarians have difficulty finding food here. Minimal touting, which is something to be grateful for. Relatively accessible as well for people with mobility issues."
Wanton mee is good
"the satay thooo, eat babat and beef"
Nice local food! Satay is a must!
"this place has always been my favorite hawker centre. best ambient, no disappointment in food so far and the best tau pok cuttlefish stall is here. great place to hang out on weekend especially at night. never fail to bring my foreigner friends to come here instead of newton circle"
"Satay is good..Musa  seafood  bbq stingray ,kangkong and sambal sotong is ."
Superb food. pricey but it's a tourist place. Great  seating atmosphere for small groups.
Great place to visit again...  Recommended
Seating problem

Nice location with many choice of food
nice place and good food
Still have lots of local food
"Various shops selling the same kind of seafood and food varieties. Choose wisely, some taste the best some just so so...."
"Satay and good choice of  local food. Vegetarians have no choice, maybe some of the stalls may customise for you. Good location to catch up with friends. Difficult to find place to sit during weekdays"
Very dirty
"This is one of the most visited beaches in the Singapore. Good place to host a party, family visit, get together. Nicely maintained and lots of options to do. Verity of options for food lovers. Mc'd, sea food restaurants, hawker center and more. We usually go with my kids she love this beach and enjoyed a lot."
Cosy place but a bit on the high side of the price
One of the best place to eat in Singapore.  variety of good food.  A lot of local and foreigner come here.  Some more it's near to the beach. I love this place.
Nice food and excellent view by the waterfront.
"Shi Wu Hao Chi,Wan Feng Xu Xu,Chi Wan Huan Ke Yi Qu Hai Tan San Bu"
Is one of my favorites hawkers. Food view. Awesome .
The quality of food has dropped significantly catering more to foreigners and tourists. The service level was quite appalling.
Best experience......affordable price...good food
"This is a popular place on weekends because of the number of beach goers. Can be very pack and hard to find seats. Food prices are reasonable and affordable. Just that quality isn't that great. Just ok.
Nice place to hang out with friends and family."
Food prices more for tourist
"East Coast Hawker Centre, this should be a Singapore heritage. My suggestion on food;
1. Satay, there are many stalls that sell satay, but only 1 Chinese stall that sell pork satay.
2. The Wan Tan mee is unique here.
3. The duck rice, my favourite is their porridge.
4. The fried / BBQ seafood is also a must try. Stingray is my choice.
5. There's this Rojak stall here that uses charcoal to grill the tau-pok and yew-tiao. Don't mix up with other stalls.
6. For some reasons unknown to me, I must drink sugarcane juice when I am here.
7. There is also a awesome Beer Garden with a solo guitarist, if the weather is cooling then it's perfectly."
Really great selection of food. Can get busy
Nice food and beach
"must try the Zuo Ji duck rice, is too good to miss, enter through the main entrance and the stall can be located in the right wing of the food village"
Family gathering area 
"Huge hawker food Centre by the beach where both locals and tourists go (more locals come here). Everything is cheap and cooked fresh, made to order. Very hard to find a table since it's really packed, especially around dinner time. If you're a tourist/ visitor, how the locals (our friends) do it is you just find a table that's about to finish, then stand around/near it, don't have to rush them but this is how you'd get the table. Everyone is friendly and they wouldn't mind you standing around. Tables are cleaned by staff at the centre at soon as people leave. This is where you'd get the best hawker food in Singapore."
Very less restaurents. Only stall i like n always go is thai style restaurent
Fair pricing
"The cheapest place to dine on the East Coast Park. You will be spoiled by the selection of barbeque in the evening as the market really comes alive. Main stay item to order would be the satay and the BBQ chicken wings.

When the sun is bright in the sky, the few stalls that is open dish out some of the best food in the area. To name, the braised Pork leg and the duck rice is a must try.. everything else is optional"
"Has many good seafood stalls with the local special chilli crab, quite expensive just like other seafood restaurants"
Good quality affordable seafood available hawker centre inside east coast park
Nice view of the sea. I drank a coconut and ate satay. Mutton (to me) is the most tender..
"Great hawka market! Many locals. Can take quite some time to get a table, so start scouting early or simply ask some locals if you can join them at their table. Generally clean. Follow the crowds, they know what's good. Restrooms available but very high turnover, so don't expect much."
Bbq chicken the best
Mee rebos satay stall 50.. awesomeness
Excellent sea food. Will go again
Expensive hawker food
Good and cheap place to stop whilst cycling. Friendly juice bar guy.
Satay were really good...ordered chinese food.HORRIBLE....NOT worth. Satay was the best
The best place for outdoor eateries
Lot of food selection and refreshing drinks after a good run or walk in ECP
Nice place with beach views
"lots of good food eg satay, bbq wings. open concept ie no aircon. the carpark beside is quite full during weekends."
Loads of Satay stall. Many choices of food to choose from.
"The location is nice, but food is a bit overpriced."
Food kakis heaven
Relaxing parks along the coast line with big food court ...
The Malay satay is fabulous
"Food was okay, crowded and a bit pricey."
"All the great Singapore food to curb your craving. Prices are competitive and ensure you asked for the price to your meal prior to ordering.
With the location beside the beach, you could take a stroll after your hearty meal. Downside to East Coast Lagoon Food Village is the convenience for patrons to get to."
"Perfect place for a large number of outlets to choose from....but nearly the same eatables available across most of the same types of outlets. Nevertheless, a very good experience trying local delicacies.

We got so engrossed in eating that we forgot to click several pics of what we ate!!"
This is an amazing place for seafood lovers and a very affordable one at that
East coast  food was very good and satisfaction
"Enjoying the chicken barbecue,satay, Soto ayam, mutton chop and coconut drink."
Nice satay
It has some of the best satay stores
I've always look forward eating here as the food here especially the satay is super delicious. 
Variety of food
Lots of seafood of course... great place... our second home
"One of the best food centre. Many nice food like satay beehoon, or luak, satay, barbeque chicken wings n many more."
Good for families
most of the food stalls open after noon
Food are good. Affordable. Great for family gathering. But very crowded on Saturday night. Waiting time for table 1hr. Waiting time for food 1hr.
"Went around mid day.  Hardly and stalls open. Those that were opened offered similar food so not much of a choice.
Food is mediocre in taste.
Restrooms are disgusting. Only use the restroom if you really have no choice"
"A few nice food stalls, e.g. duck rice. Many more stalls on nights and weekends. But parking lots are limited, esp during popular or peak times."
"Always'a good choice - try Popiah, duck rice, chicken rixe and the chicken wing stall. Great taste and food."
"Too crowded and some food are over-hyped, some maybe tastes good but mostly not that delicious IMHO."
Satay and BBQ wings are a must! And wash them down with sugarcane juice.
"Great, chill place to go on weekday afternoons, though most shops are closed. Lots of parking, near the sea"
Good place for foodies
"There is a wide selection of food here, you can enjoy a huge variety of barbeque meat too. Highly recommended"
Many food choices available. Toilets can be dirty at times. There is a share-bike parking area nearby which makes it quite convenient.
Difficult to get a table. Smelly drainage needs to be settled.
"Went there yesterday night, but the place was disgusting. Half eaten food on the ground, tables not cleared properly, rubbish all around the place. Saw a stall cleaning their utensils on top the drainage cover. The smell there was horrible."
Great variety of tasty food. Don't forget to get the ice cream from the Uncle situated outside the entrance most nights
Food was average. U gotto buy from the right stalls for exceptionally great food. However I think it has a great mix of variety. Food for all from young children. We spent like $120 on ala-cartes for 8 adults and 4 kids. Carpark was full but with slight patience we soon got a spot. I do not mind going back there to try out other stalls after spending time at the beach again. But I may take away again as I prefer to be Zen when I have my food.
"The pork n chic satay was good. Not forgetting chongpang bbq chic wings...tasted fantasic! Though it was crowded even at near 9pm,, still a nice n worthly place to visit after cycling."
Very good food after nice evening at beach
THE place to have exotic sea food
Don't buy coconuts from Heng Heng. Diluted with water. Dishonest.
A lot good food  . .
This place is getting worst
Where you can find varities of food. (Satay)
"Very nice fish porridge  n chicken salads , carrot cake,  satay"
No vegetarian options
Best pepper crab n satay ever !
Great place worth a visit.
"Rather pricey hawker food, for the more well heeled folks."
"A lot of halal and non halal food options available. Plenty of drink stalls selling mostly the same things like sugar cane juice and coconut water. A lot of seafood options too and satay stalls too. Bbq stingray with sambal and prawns cooked in different ways.
Open air sitting as well as with covered seating available.
Good place to hang out with family and friends and right next to the beach.
A lot of parking spaces nearby too."
Sibei nice
"Great food Chilli Crab, Pepper crab, bbq Chilli Stingray amazing!"
"Good hawker fare, but come prepared with cash as they are unlikely to accept other forms of payment. Toilet facilities are present but may not be comfortable"
Awesome food
Great food at affordable prices
East coast hawker center
Nice place to enjoy
"Very delicious food, should try the satte"
Expensive and not that good
Lots of food
"Plenty of choice of food, esp seafood & satay at reasonable price"
Choose the right stall and you will love yr food.
Mr Fatman sell tasty satay and BBQ chix
"Only hawker centre by the lagoon, very popular with local, a mixed of Muslims and Chinese offerings, satay. Seafood, grill, famous wanton mee and many more. Good place to relax and enjoy beers with friends and family, open alfresco if not raining.. cheers"
"We ordered more than we can eat, all tasted good. Chili crab, shells, stingray, satay.....didn't have capacity to eat oyster omelet and laksa, will come back next time."
Yummiest food
Tried Gong Gong truly taste like just out from the sea...need more rinsing
Good and scenic place to hang out. Food prices are reasonable
"Food here is great, fresh and affordable."
"Many food stalls to choose, but wks end need to wait several times. Go on wks day much better."
"the satay, chicken wings, rojak, duck rice, wantan noodle tasted good as they were served when I was there 20 years ago."
The food is really bad. Newton is still the best
Good place to get all the local favourites at one go.
"Had satay at Harun Satay Stall...well marinated, juicy and tasty peanut sauce! Drop by if u guys around that area..."
Very nice view
Good place to eat nearer to the sea
Highly recommended! #01-56 & #01-54 please show them these pictures and order!

"Seafood, satay, beef beenhoon and so much more"
"Good place to grab food and drinks, especially nice to grab seats facing the sea."
Great food
Good variety of hawker food. Standards vary though.
Love this place. Good food and ambience
Cool place to chill and enjoy the sunset with drinks and food
Alright place to go... Once a while
Lots of good food for dinner
"Must Go Place for Dinner. Near east coast beach and perfect place for friends , families to hangout. Recommended Oyster Omelette, Black Pepper Crab, bbq chicken wing , grilled stingray and other seafood"
Many varieties of seafood and satay. Good Taste Reasonable Prices
Local food galore
Nice selection of food and drink stalls but gets very busy.
From good food to good view and good atmosphere to experience local delights
I went there because I was hungry in the middle of playing
Just go for a walk and enjoy the views
Bath can be taken. Clean; varieties of food in McDonalds and food court; playground for kids; jogging track; water skiing available. Connected through public transport.
"The foods just okay, but the place is really pretty and great time for family or groups"
Nice food.
Pretty good place to eat Seafood and Satay
"Love the atmosphere here, always full, always queue( especially the famous stalls), many choices of different cultures of food you can try anything a bit, very energetic. Good food and it also at the East coast, after or before eating, you can walk or bicycling around. It's the longest beach area in Singapore."
High kee seafood have nice chilli crab n salted egg chicken..sambal lala recommended too for those love spicy
"Avoid going in the day as some stalls may not be open. My go to place for BBQ chicken wings and sambal stingray! Great variety of food, huge seating area and bring cash not card. There's an atm machine nearby if you run out of cash."
"A good hangout place at the beach. East coast of Singapore. Nice breeze. Just that a bit expensive. Go early on weekends otherwise, will not get a seat."
"One of my favourite hawker centres. Lots of stalls there. My favourites are the beef noodles, wanton mee, satay beehoon, fried carrot cake and Haron's satay."

"Foods are good and tasteful , Coconut Water is my favourite"
Eat n eat n eat
Best affordable prices for seafood and local food.
Nice food to eat at night with friends
"Where hawkers food are sold besides the beach, prices are moderately higher than other hawkers. Hot beverages are overpriced.."
One of favourite destination for seafood lovers...
Break time
"Beautiful and enjoyable after a sumptous seafood dinner -satay crab, barbecued prawns."
"Cheap good environment,many food to choose from"
Delicious coconuts served here
"Had really great food here. Singapore classics: Black pepper crab, BBQ stingray with sambal, satay, prawn cake, sugar cane juice. Everything was really excellent. Minus one star because of all the touting, staff at some stalls target westerners pretty aggressively."
Lovely food and ambience
So delicious food and nice place
Best chicken wings and Chineses barbecue. Location is amazing right next to the beach. Malay food don't waste your time especially satay. Very bad quality.
Erg gezellig en heel veel lokale eten. Je zal geen spijt van hebben om hier te komen. Bon appetit!!
Still very nostalgic after all these years
Must visit and try the food
Good place for family
Nice and simple place for lunch.
The food is So GOOD !!! 
Forever Stingray! 
Relax Palace
Our local friend took us here. And we had nice food with cheap price and really enjoy the night seaside view.
"East Coast Lagoon Food Village situated near to the seaside and along East Coast Park Service Road houses a variety of food store ranging from noodles to seafood to satay, just to name a few. Food pricing are rather reasonable but some seafood menu don't come cheap but if you are all about food than you will definitely be spoiled for choice for the amount of food option you have. On normal days waiting time aren't as long so an average of 10 to 15mins is all it takes but prepared to wait alittle longer in weekend especially during dinner time. However, it's unfortunate that not all seating areas are sheltered. There's ATM machines so you don't have to worry if you run out of cash. All in all, it's a good dining place on a weekend because after a meal, a nice walk by the beach would be a great choice."
Its hard to know which shops is good unless u have recommendations
"Crowded place on a weekend or dinner hours, extremely hard to find seats with large groups"
A variety of food there.
Must try: Fried oyster nearest to main entrance. Probably one of the best in Singapore!
awesome place..
No Singapore without hawker centers. I hope they look stay the way they are. Also in prime locations like this one...
"Good Place to have dinner, lot of varities of sea food"
Extra large cup of sugar cane juice for just $3! Very good value for money! Great for hanging out after cycling or a run
A bit far and parking sometimes busy if you are dtinking but good place for satay and hawker style seafood. I like that it's next to the beach. Nice to do if you are a tourist visiting in SG. Good way to try cheap local food. Bring your own tissues
Affordable price to have an authentic singapore meal by the beach
"I like this place, plenty of very local food and local.people, there are not so many tourist and price of the food is reasonable, said it a price foe local people. This place is just along the beach, nice view and ambience."
Delicious foods varieties from seafood satays n many more.Enjoy the tranquility if the beaches.
"If you are there ,satay at stall 59 named Banana.sg is a must try. Delicious"
Favorite food all at one location
Just another hawker centre. The addition star is for its proximity to the beach.
Very good place for vist and spend less
Crowded on a fri night.bought seafood from the most bright halal chinese stall but turns out food so2 only. Not worth it esp the fish;so small but pay for large. Satay and bbq wings are good. Would try other stalls next time.
Nice food court. Was there in the evening good food.
Lots of nice food here but very crowded on weekends
Satay is good but ketupat is using plastic wrap instead of coconut leaf. Not sure good for health or not
Good selection of local food and quite reasonably priced. Being beside the beach also gives some refreshing views and feels.
Various foods available delicious
Lovely lovely satay!
Nice place to spending time with ur love one....
Long time no visit and it is still very crowded especially on weekends
Good food but needs more seating
I did a cycling in East - Coast Park
Finally they have the return trays announcement.
Each of the Satay stalls is a must try..
So this is a huge food court with lot of food stalls. It is just next to the beach! It gets crowdy in the evening. I wouldn't suggest going there in the morning because stalls hardly open up in the morning. I think mostly for lunch or dinner. It is a nice place with lot of covered seating option. Lot of multi-cuisines and very similar to Singapore food court concept. There is still stall which serves Popiah. I love Popiah in general but the Popiah they serve here is also quite good!
Long time no visit. Very popular in the weekend. Very  crowded.
"A paradise of local hawker flair. There's a wide variety of bbq food, such as stingray, chicken wings and satay. On top of that you can find tasty hawker flair such as cockles, fried prawn noodles, Song Kee oyster egg, fried rice, fried guotiao and fried carrot cakes. You can also choose to complement your dishes with a mug of beer, sugar cane drink or even a coconut.

If you want to eat healthier, there's also a famous duck porridge Zuo Ji Ya Zhou. Otherwise, you can easily find stalls that sell seafood or fish soup, coupled with rice."
"Attractive place becos of proximity to the beach. Always crowded, especially on weekends & holidays."
Great food but not much variety.
Great food. Fantastic choice.
amazing spot to hangout
"A huge variety of food and drink, and if you are lucky you can get a seat near the beach!"
A coozy and nice place to have foods and relax.
overpriced and so so quality food
A good place for excursion. The are curiously many seafood. Halal food is also available. I took a very nice bike ride along the beach. A bit messy if anything.
Awesome food paradise. You have a lot of seafood stalls which caters to all your needs. Lots of satay stall too by i recommend Harun Satay.
The food was nice at some stalls but some were very bad presented. Disturb by the hawkers there cos to me it is still feels like touting..
Bought satay. Delicious and nice. Great for outdoor family outing
Makan place
Nice bbq chickin.
Awesome food especially when to have dinner as the food is just to amazing
"A great place if you are looking for a good fill by the sea. This food centre offers a wide variety of local delights from satay, bbq chicken wings, fruit rojak, laksa and many more. On weekends will be extremely crowded. Lunch time here is best wearing shorts and tshirt as it will be humid. Price wise is slightly higher than normal hawker but worth it."
Always great food to discover here.  Great way to spend a Sunday lunch or afternoon by the sea with some local eats.  Definitely my favourite hawker market in Singapore.
"Only came here for the beef noodles and chicken wings. Very overpriced zichar and bbq dishes here, obviously meant to chop willing tourists."
Overcrowded
Nice food for tourist...alll varieties by d sea
Good place for cheap eats. Also food is good
Nice place to chill and get a nice seaview
"A very popular food joint amongst Singaporeans. Wide variety of food available with an emphasis on barbecued seafood and chicken wings. Satay, the sweet barbecued meat is also a popular choice."
"It's sad that d original *satay bee hoon*
has changed hand. Too many seafood stall. Toilet shld hv some1 to keep clean/supply at all time."
Good bra fish & satay
"Fantastic array of food choices, service crews were quick to clear tables to overcome the shortage of tables/ seats for customers"
"Great location against the beach, quite a few special eating places. Need a car to get there though, as public transport non existent"
Good but slightly overpriced food. Place can be a little dirty here and there.
"Ga o duoi tang ham,phai di bo hoi xa"
Very hard to find seat during dinner
Easy to find HALAL food here
Better seafood than the restaurants... Try Stingray sea food shop.. Won't regret
Great Lokal Foods
They could add more fans to cool the place down as the place is humid with all the smoke and hot air. Food wise is more to bbq and satay. Best if they could have abit of everything.
I love fooooooood!!!!!!!
Good selection of food. Getting a table can be tricky at peak hours on a weekend.
So me the taste of food is not that good but the environment was relax and good for having some beer at sunset
This is the only hawker center that faced the sea. Very popular place for a meal especially weekend when it can be very crowded. You'll need transport to get here as it is not near any train station. I think only 1 bus service the area on weekend and am not sure there is any on weekdays. You can get a great mixed of hawker food and zi char.
Good varieties besides the beach reasonable price
A lot of local seafood restaurant here
Satay is good.
Best BBQ Chicken Wings
Great food variety ang i love their sugar cane with lemon large
Many tasty foods but the surroundings a bit dirty. The satay stores are tasty here.
Perfect hangout place with water sports
Expensive and oily food.
"Open air with sheltered eating areas. Nice atmosphere and food such as satay, seafood bbq"
"A bit touristy and costy, yet still genuine and tasty place for seafood meal. Got it recommended by a local, turned out to be absolutely worth a drive outside the city centre."
One of the best food court for seafood and satay
Place to spend evening by the sea with local food and drinks.
Nice foods
Lots of choices of food
This has got to be one of the best makan places to satisfy your satay cravings. With a stall selling halal duck satay for those of you Muslim brothers and sisters who'd like to try it. It's my personal favourite.
Ah hwee chicken wings is delicious and the egg omelette next door is the best too
Nice food to be with friends and family gathering
"It is always great to be out of the flat to dine with the Sun, Sand & Sea. Makan quality, quantify and prices still acceptable. Polystyrene plates tend to fly off with the sea breeze."
Bra och billig mat och mycket att valja pa
Great food
Cozy place. Nice food.
The place is okay. There are plenty of varieties to choose from. Should have more sheltered sitting area for rainy days. One major downside is there are too much touting going on. Please just let people sit where they want and order where they want to.
Good food...
Visited during a rainy monday. Not many stalls open. Food nothing much to expect from but. Clean
"I love this place, the tulang merah is better than Beach Rd but some singaporean is not having a civic minded, after eat then sit and relax playing phone while another people is waiting them to get the table. Dont order sugarcane from that old chinese lady because her stall.its diluted sugarcan with extra sugar.yuckks"
The foods very nice.Nice place for gathering
The place is over rated. There is no playground for children. Food is ok ok only.
Vast selection of hawker food. But more expensive than regular food centers
Overall the place is good. Just that the toilet is very dirty.
"Good food, come before 5:30pm on weekends to avoid the crowds!"
Lots of food & drinks options. Reasonable pricing. Car parking available. Accessible by bus as well. Bus stop is just a stone's throw away. Beach front is also in front of the food village.
The variety of food there is amazing! Despite the wait for seats (yes it gets really crowded) it will be all worth it :)
"Place is by the seaside. Ambience great. However, if you are looking forward to eat good food, you will be disappointed. Food is served using disposable plates/bowls n utensils. Price is also higher than other places."
Great food court. Many choices
Overpriced and mediocre hawker food. Targetted at the tourist crowd.
Good place to chill
"Top food, worth a visit."
Happening place and hard to get a table. But lots of great options of delicious seafood and with great price. Opens till late. Suggest to go in a group.
Nice hawker location at the beach ..but must know the good stalls.
Lots of nice food here
Always good
Easy to find
"Excellent food court, nice ambience, great service and very good food. Very tasty satay "
"Beautiful and clean beach, lots of people on the weekend and Sunday. Food centre with wide variety of local food at reasonable prices. Well slightly higher than the food centre in the housing area of course. Great place for family and pet dog, also a great place for weekend fishing at the Bedok  jetty."
"Nice food, nice view"
Good local food and seafood
Food really awersome.. try it
Drink beer near the beach is really very enjoyable. Good food at affordable price.
Nice place for having food
The NEA officer is suck place is very dirty
"Good selection. Several famous stalls , such as oyster omelette, harun satay, beef noodle, braised duck rice. Also good selection of seafood stalls for sambal stingray and chilli crab. Enjoy!"
"Wet tables n chairs aft heavy rain, many tables not covered, afternoon will eat under hot sun, all hawkers charge local diners like tourists, low class menu sold at downtown Aircon food court prices, Not many choices, many stalls sell the same food, eg, bbq seafood, drinks stalls, satays, my suggestion, if u want to enjoy the sea breeze n sea front dinning, buy outside n eat there, wise choice so those blood sucking hawkers will suffer n drop prices"
"One of the nicest places for food - particularly seafood - in Singapore. It's an outdoor food court, but if you can get near the front there is lovely breeze coming in off the sea. A great location to watch the hundreds of ships waiting to unload or set sail with a new location."
Good variety. Reasonable prices. Pleasant area next to the beach. Ample pay parking.
"Nice place to have dinner especially Halal Satay, Chicken Wings abd Seafood by the beach"
Good food and view but always crowded
A chill place to have a beer and Singapore hawker food
Fried carrot cake and cha kue tiao  so...shiok!
"Food used to be better. Some stall vendors have left after the renovation. None the less, it can be very crowded during dinner times or the weekends."
Very crowded and lively place for bbq food! Ended up ordering takeaway food (:
"Lovely place, clean and enjoyable"
"Very good ""oluak"" ( oyster omlette)and Hokkien Mee. Also ""satay chelup""."
"Food quality and taste were less than impressive.  I had ordered seafood fried rice, some vegetables, and satay along with chendol to serve as a refreshing beverage. The satay sauce was watered down to the point that it didn't stick to the meat. Seafood fried rice was rather tasteless and the fragments of meat didn't even constitute to the value paid. Last but not least, the chendol had a large chunk of ice from shaved ice fuzzing together from storage. Next time, I'm bringing my own food."
Fantastic selections... Just dun go on Mondays when the popular ones are closed
"Price wise, it's definitely affordable. Lots of food choices to choose from. If you're craving for grilled  stingray with chilli, this definitely one of the reasons you should visit this particular hawker. If you're driving, there is ample parking space. However, the place tends to get very crowded on weekends especially during dinner time."
Wide variety of local and international food almost on the beach.
Love the place
"There are 2 other hawker centers like East Coast Lagoon in Singapore.

But in terms of atmosphere, vibes and Food, this is the place I go to.

My favorite fried oyster is right here!"
Aloha great venue for paddling
Quite nice food. Esp the curry puff and ah hui chicken wings
Fun local stop for seafood and all type of local dishes
Pale ...nothing much
"Great place for some decent hawker food in a nice setting, esp in the evenings when it is cooler. I like getting the BBQ pork noodles, satay, and beer and finding a seat facing the beach where you can get a nice breeze."
Nice place for meal and snacks
Good place for see foods and price is reasonable.
"I enjoy having dinner at this place, you can get all different kinds of food, but the place is mostly known for seafood.
Prices are slightly higher than other hawker centers, but still good prices.
The seating is outside, some areas have roof, but wouldn't go there if it's raining; best places are the front rows with beach view.
Some stalls would deliver food to your table so be prepared with the number when you order - it's printed on the table.
Friday and Saturday night very hard do find a seat after 6.
At lunch time only a few stalls are open, but you can enjoy the quiet."
Delicious food!!
Really love the Satay. 
"This place was fun. Many food court was there, you can order food and the store employee's will bring the food to your table. You have to let them know what your table number will be. Services are amazing, environment is amazing. Right after having lunch, went for a walk near the river."
Must try duck satay
"Good food, good ambience (facing sea) and close proximity to town and Marine Parade. Things need for improvement. Lighting in the evening (too dark, too cosy for a hawker center) Seats should be brighter and different colors. Bigger and strong ceiling fan (for those under the shed)"
Nice place with food and drinks but get ready to sweat
"Gets really crowded on weekends. But trumps in terms of variety of food. Beef noodles stall is great (near the ATM machine), duck rice is great, wanton noodles, and seafood and craft beers. Pricey vs neighbourhood coffeeshops though. But remains one of our favourite haunts."
Food is cheap. Taste is soso.
Good food wide variety hard parking
Good is good but price is expensive
Great place for local seafood
Difficult to find seats
superb place for Sea food lovers.
Needs a good clean
Very good food
Good place to have nice seafood and of course the all famous duck rice at east coast lagoon. But with good food you need to have good drinks too! There is a nice a nice and brand new smoothie shop called Vogue Sg at the hawker(stall no.23). Their durian and coconut smoothie was GOOD!
"The best seafood in town!!! So much to choose from at an affordable price too. We had satay as a starter, then had stingray, cockles, snails and a fried oyster omelette!!! All five of us left satisfied. "
"Lots of local food here by the beach. Some famous stall include Wan Ton noodle, Satay Bee Hoon, duck rice, etc."
Nice food & lot of people
Hawker  food wif sea view.. where to find?? Only at east coast
Nice place to get variety of local food
Kids enjoy the seafood and time there. It server great food with a reasonable price. Also a great walk around after meal.
Great local food at decent prices! Great for big gatherings or if  you and your friends feel like eating a lot!
Food a bit pricy due to its location
"For Muslim food lovers, satay is a necessity here and barbequed chicken wings..."
Good hawker food. You can try the cheok kee duck rice or the BBQ wings here
There's alot of seafood & satay shop here...if you are coming here for the halal food don't waste ur time coming here their standard have drop. And if you come on weekend be prepared to hunt for seats coz it can get super crowded.
Good food for a good price beside the beach. It is very difficult to get to by commute.
Lots of local food all under 1 roof.
"Great food. Stingray was delicious! Sugar cane drink is superb in a ginormous plastic cup. Pack w people on a sat night at almost 10pm.

A definite must try to bring foreign friends."
Super crowded
Very Good Experience...
"Extremely crowded during Friday and Saturday.
Not all stalls are good. Read specific reviews."
"Nice environment, food was reasonably nice with the price you paid for. Lots of variety."
"Lot of local foods, ample seating. However can be quite crowded during the weekend. Variety is better than Newton Circle Food center"
"East Coast is my favorite Hawker center in Singapore. I came with a couple of coworkers after work and we shared:

1) chili crab
2) beef and chicken sate
3) grilled stingray
4) calamari
5) chinese broccoli
6) carrot cake
7) teh Tarik (pulled milk tea)

The teh Tarik tea was not sweet and aerated really nicely through the hand pulling technique. This drink is usually way too sweet for my liking and good at the first sip but hard to finish. This version is best one of these I had while in Asia.

The Sate has a nice bbq flavor and were juicy and not dried out. Sate in Singapore and Indonesia is really a step above what I have had in other places. Eating the real thing almost makes me not enjoy them outside of south east Asia.

Singapore's iconic dish is the chili crab. The sauce is fantastic and pairs really well with the fried bread for dipping (analogous to curry and naan bread for Indian food). This dish is the only one that is expensive. Value for money isn't there like everything else but if you have never had it before you need to have it at least once.

Squid, carrot cake, and veggies were also very good but not extremely memorable."
Tons of satay and other local fares.
"Wings , beer , sunset and sea breeze. What else to ask for ?"
Satay and seafood by beachside at affordable price!
Reasonable food but good place to chill
Great atmosphere. Food are priced reasonably.
"Great selection of vendors selling a variety of food.  Not cheap but it is delicious.  It gets very busy, but that adds to the vibe.  Love the sambal stingrays, the grilled mantis shrimp and all the other local delicacies."
"Lots of good food... usually crowded.
Hot and stuffy."
very nice place to eat during weekdays.  Not on weekends - too crowded
Its a very fun to go with your family!Alot of food and a nuce beach ro swim in!
Enjoyed the time together with family. Spoilt for choice on local food.... Yummm
Can go cycling before or after food. Very nice chicken wing and satay from the stall Bedok chicken wing. Near the atm
Nice place for lunch. No crowd. Enjoy the good food and the seaside.
"Some hawkers are friendly, some stuck up. Need to choose sugar cane drink stall carefully as certain stalls add water. Seafood tastes generally good"
First time been there during  night.  A lot of stores selling satay and seafood
"Packed! Always packed. The food was nice there, probably one of the closest delicious hawker food in town. Some serving was big, so price is reasonable."
Very crowded place. But the view and sea breeze are amazing if you get the table near the beach. Chicken satay and grill stingray are delicious.
Wonderful bbq seafood but hard to find seats for big groups
Very goood food
"the place is still the same since it was opened years ago. unfortunately not a good remark. Even if they dont renovate ur update the place, at least the place shld be upkept the place. As why we always came here for, is the good food. Always good food here! "
good placed & good food
"Delicious food in budget, perfectly served."
Best Chilli crab in the Universe
Alot of verity. Halal food and non halal food.
Great place for an outdoor dinner or supper with family and friends. Thus is a satay haven for satay lover looking for satayfaction. There are wide varieties of food served and over the weekend it will be very crowded. Can have a nice stroll by the beach after meal. Wonderful experience.
"Xin Jia Po Zui Hao De Da Pai Dang Zhi Yi,Xuan Ze Duo,Chu Pin Hao,Jie Ge He Li,Zhi De Qian Qu Pin Shang. "
"Not enough seats.families, friends not just eating but also catching up with each other so need more time at their tables.pls provide more sitting areas so everybody can enjoy themself without having to hurry up eat and leave."
"One thing that I absolutely miss about being in the army was the proximity of my camp to East Coast Lagoon Food Village. Whenever I felt extremely motivated, I'd go for a run during my nights out and drop by there for a good cup of freshly made sugar cane juice. I would always add a slice of lemon as it makes the drink super refreshing. Whenever I'm there, my nose would be attacked by a myriad of tantalising aromas, as if they were fighting for my attention. I would be clueless, trying to trace and figure out which stall it was coming from. To help those like me out, here is a list of the must-tries so you'll know what to get the next time you're there."
"The place is organized with way too much plastic use! Even for people who are not taking away, they also give plastic utensils and disposable plates."
Wide variety of foods and drinks.
Lai Zhe Li Yong Can Zui Hao Zai Bang Wan 7pmZhi Qian Huo Zai 9.30 Zhi Hou
"most stalls open in the evening, nice place to have a beer or coconut drink to chill with some decent food"
Great place for an array of food
"A variety of food available but many stalls are selling the same kind of food. On the whole good variety and a good place to visit with overseas friends.
Recent visit and ordered the pig trotter. It is very good to go with rice.
Harom satay standard has gone down a little bit. Quite a portion of the satay is burnt and I got to remove them."
Wide variety of food!
"Good Hawker Centre where you can find several very good stalls serving Wanton Noodles, Fried Oysters, Satay and Seafood."
Pleasant ambience and a great mood lifter
Wide variety of food. The duck stall and Thai food stall are one of the many nice ones there.
Singapore East Coast Food Center Strong Recommendation
Nice hangout but a bit more pricey compared to hawker centre
Get the local experience. Great food at a reasonable price.
"Great ambient, great food, great company...  Awesome."
Great variety
love it here
Good foods
"Come there three times a week or more  as living at the Marine Parade Area
Great place good food options and cold beverages"
"Ren Chao Duo,Shi Wu Duo Yang Hua. "
Over priced
"If you are exploring East Coast Park, this is one of your only options for local food, however do take note that the prices aren't exactly the cheapest as this place caters quite abit to tourists. Dinner is the best option as most of the stalls are open for dinner then. Food here is good for sharing!"
"Nothing special, just a typical bunch of food stalls"
My personal vote for Best food hawker centre in Singapore.
"Loads of local food options, most stalls are open until late in the evening, be prepared to hunt around for seating!!"
"Satay and chicken wings were juicy and delightful, must try"
"They have one of the best curry puff,taupo juher,engchei juher n sambal bbq stingray."
Authentic local food with great local atmosphere.
Nice food! 
Local nice food
"Over-rated and expensive. Rubbish all around and local diners are too lazy to clear their own tables after eating. Though, the Thai green  chicken curry is excellent and must have half a small chicken in the curry for SGD$5.50. Other than that it's a rip-off place for expats and tourists."
"Nice BBQ Sting Ray , and Satay here. May have difficulty in finding carpark lot next to the hawkers center. Then have to search for Tables. The sugar cane juice is ex. $3 for half a cup of ice cube."
Kool place good foods.
"I would rate this food centre above Newton Circle food centre, for prices, choice, and scene."
"Guang Xian Bu Zu,You Qi Ting Che Chang"
Good makan place
Too much use of disposables and polystyrene.
Local food and plenty of variety
"Very busy, Good place to eat though seating is hard to find due to its popularity. Prices are slightly more expensive than a standard hawker centre. Most dishes will have seafood than meat. Which is good for me."
Many seafood served here
"Popular porridge stall 39, bbq seafood, satay and a string of others..."
Lots of good food stall
Amazing Singapore food. Must try satay
Bu Cuo. You Xu Duo Mei Shi. 
Good food available here
"Quite crowded and packed for food, great place to hang out with friends"
Cleaner now
The amazing place
Great food. Difficult to get seat. But food will makes u super thirsty after eating..
Due to hari raya holidays many halal shops are closed today. Hope it will back to operation soon
"Large hawker with lots of stalls, but unfortunately not next variety. Mostly satay and seafood. No Indian stalls, hardly any vegetarian choices etc. Disappointing."
This is still the best place for Singapore Street Food. The ambience is decidedly local - multiracial and multicultural.  Amazing. The food is worth the parking and queuing woes.  Freshest stingray from stall 16. No bones. Try it without sambal chili with garlic and freshly cut onions.  Satay next door is second only to its crispy perfectly seasoned BBQ chicken wings.  And the list goes on. Yeah. Go go go.
"local food delights. Ambience is unlike the many hawker centres dotting Singapore. This one is tailored for a more relaxed  rather than mass seating. Having said that, it does get awfully crowded during the regular peak hours (after office hours, weekends and public holidays). The Satays are quite good, though there are several stalls offering this fare and you should try a few to see which one suits you.
There are well located wash basins which is great to get clean up between using your hands for Chicken Wings and others.
OVerall a good place to meet friends. Take a stroll along the beach after dinner.
There is a sandcastle building area just 50 meters towards the sea. There is also Ski 360 just next to this lagoon hawker centre."
"Many stalls here, it is a very big place with many seats. Many stalls compete for customers as there are alot of the same items being sold but by different people."
One of the better wanton mee stall and porridge there.
Most stalls are closed in the afternoon.
It was quite ok but the cleanliness is quite bad
"Great selection, nice atmosphere. Avoid Saturday nights - it can ge super busy!"
Nice seafood
"Huan Jing Hao,Mei Shi Duo,Ke Zi You Xuan Ze,Huan You Mian Fei wifi"
Got delicious vegetarian food..!
Good place n good food.
"Inexpensive food, huge area for dining."
Nice and very pricy place for local food. Come early on weekends to get a table.
Amazing choice of zhi zhar/bbq seafood.
Nice seafood court. Good for some beers.
"The "" goo-bak"" (beef soup noddles)  at East Coast Lagoon Food Centre is very good n value for money."
Must visit in singapore
Scorching HOT
"A nice immersion to Singapore local food fare, fairly priced. Go for it!"
Good.  Food also delicious.
Way too crowded on a weekend
"Xin Jia Po Mei Shi Da Ji He,Xi Huan Da Pai Dang Gan Jue De,Yi Ding Xi Huan Zhe Li. "
"The open air and sea breeze are amazing. Many improptu business discussions, family sharing and just fellowship with one another... loved the seafood and the fresh sugarcane"
Weekend very crowded...
A good place to walk around and enjoy the sea view. Good place really.
Nice place for some nice food
"The seafood can be hit and miss dependent on which stall you choose and it is quite pricey independent of where you go. Can be very busy in the evenings in nice weather, especially weekends, you have to wait long times to get a table and we found people generally unwilling to share."
"There is a DBS cash withdrawal machine available. Options are grilled seafood, sugarcane juice. Open air concept and can get crowded between 7-830pm. Halal options available (facing the sea, on the right)"
This is the place where you can find the good ol' traditional foods of Singapore. Have been patronising this place since a young age.
Nice environment. A lot of food there but shortage of tables and seats.
"Good local food, but price a bit on the high side."
Foods ok. To much smoking to enjoy
Variety of local excellent foodies available.
Uncomfortable seating and bad value for the food from the zichar. Other stalls are ok.
"One of the great place to eat in the east. Needless to so much good food in one place.. avoid the peak hours so less 1 star for waiting for parking, waiting for table, waiting in line for food. Only remember to take pics for the first 2 plates lolz.. the rest is gone before i knew it.."
Great place to have food. Can get very crowded on weekends though
Awesome food options for sea food lovers
Great place for dinner after a day at the beach. Many good food here. The beef quey teow is a must try.
"Great food, reasonable price. Seafood is nice. Malay satay is fantastic"
finding a table is almost impossible
Just go.  Great place in a fantastic location
"Good range of seafood, not so crowded in the afternoon"
Was good... Now just a bad hawker centre
Food is excellent
I never expect this seafood village that you can enjoy the wind and the foods
Good food and a good place to hang out with friedns along east coast park
Best Sambal Stingray at Musa! My family and I have been going there for years
Long slow walk before we reach the village. It was a little crowded but the food was great
"always love visiting this place for some authentic and good local hawker food. there are however too many similar stalls I think it's all about your taste preferences. I tried a few staffs before and will always head back to the one I think is most suitable for my taste. for oyster omelette wise, I like to visit the hougang fried oyster more then the famous song kee fried oyster which has super long queue. I think the taste of that is average and don't worth the queue."
"Though it is a popular public hawker centre, it can be cleaner. NEA please act."
See my daughter play sand at the seaside
Very pleasant place
duck rice my favorite
Nice outings
It is the place to go for food when you are at the Lagoon or generally in the East Coast Park area. The food quality and taste is generally good but is priced higher than other open air food centres. Is it because they have to pay higher rentals of is it because their clientele is on weekends only?
"Great satay, ice cold beer and chicken wings!"
Food prices getting more ex
A nice and clean food court for both local and foreigner to relax and enjoy a good and decent meals and beer near the beach
Good place to enjoy good quality of seafood like chilly crab at very reasonable price
Good thai food available
"Food center with many varieties of food stalls available, just next to the Sea sides.."
Must try the chicken rice!
Impressive place and your must have during your Singapore visit. Go there in the evening and don't forget to visit the beach.
Wanton noodle is nice. Especially is the BBQ pork.
Great place for affordable food. The satay is good.
Variety of good food to choose from... Expect long que for some stalls...
"Satay, poh piah, hokkien prawn mee are yummmmms!! You may google find out which stall is popular and recommended."
Variety of food nice place to eat...
coolest place  East Coast hawked centre.
Great food great scnery
Quiet today
Not sufficient motorccycle parking.
Food quality had fallen
Mostly close during the day
Nice cool place to relax... drink & eat while enjoying the view of the east coast where ships are in anchorage.
"Satay, sugarcane juice must try"
For true Singapore local food and cuisine at rock bottom prices.
Not much nice food there for a hawker. Good for satay
Grear ambience
"Beautiful place in front of the sea
All types of food
Inexpensive"
Nice food place just next to the seaside. Recommended!
Good food and drinks
Delicious salted egg crab!
Good food but very crowded and dirty.
Amazing food court with delicious food
"Relatively cheap and good food, what's more with a sea view (not like you can see it after sunset)."
Place to have cold beer by the sea side with grilled chicken wings or satay. Music by buskers too
"Absolutely Love it! Unfortunately a wee off the beaten Track, but great affordable(!) food in a good local athmosphere! When it gets late its difficult to get a Cab/Uber/Grab to the city from Here, but def. worth the Trip!"
Revisited this when we had a birthday for an aunt. U need to be patient in getting a table and more strategic if u need to take over a pavillion of 4 tables if u hv a big group. Not all satays n chicken wings are created equal so scout around to look at the crowds. I prefer the stalls facing the lagoon. It can get warm so dress appropriately.
Best place for hawker food! Parking is ample. Come earlier so that you can get a seat as it can get pretty crowded during dinner time. Good place for satay!
"Think about it: warm sea breezes, good food, a big crowd, perspiration and body odor coupled with swaying trees and hips, a cocktail of gastronomic experiences found in a hyped-up hawker centre matched only by her pricing. You will want to try out the satay, BBQ seafood, and expensive coconuts plucked from disappearing coconut trees amidst deforestation and perennial construction work here in the city state. A place where Statism meets Capitalism in close proximity to a hawker by the sea. Welcome!"
Delicious local food
"Lots of good local food stalls at reasonable prices except difficult to find seatings and car parks on Friday, Saturday and Sunday evening for dinner."
As hawker centres go .pretty good selection. Seating is cool and not your average mass market seating. Can be warm during the day.
Lovely atmosphere. Nice ocean breeze
"Great place for some local delights. One of my favorite is store #01-24, like the steam fish . There is the favorite stall #1 satay. The wanton noodle with char siew taste wonderful, too. The duck rice and beef kway teow are something you should try. The popiah is delicious. BBQ chicken wings and satay bee hoon are great,too."
Good outdoor environment for food and drinks
"Eat,  drink and relax alomg the coast line"
casual dining
So many choices to choose from... all good.
"Fantastic oyster omelette, satay and satay bee hoon"
Good range
Huan Jing Hao
A lot of nice food
Fried rice quantity is too much. Not clean
I go for the satays by the water. There is lots of other food there but I always have stay and chicken wings which are both highly recommended
A lot of choices
The duck rice and Satay here are awesome!
Bbq food thou can be costly
Great place good value. Only problem is trying to find seating. If your organising an evening there best to go early
Limited options as many stalls serve similar dishes. Come here to dine by the beach. Otherwise there are better hawker centres to try.
Try the braised duck rice !
Lots of nice food . Go there for satay and stingray . Yum
"Just the food stall, I have some issue with their food.  See photo for the pork ribs.

The string Ray taste ok, chili is very spicy which is good.

The clam wine soup, taste ok too. Can smell the wine but.... cannot taste it much so I believe added too much water.  If you love clam, this is one full whole of clam for $15 which is quite big bowl enough for 2 pax but I had it alone .

The prawn egg, came out to be a surprise to us.  We taste it more like fish cake paste make it like a pancake and seriously the prawn portion is pathetic less  not worth the price. I suggest going next time to ask them to cook with full eggs omelette with full size prawn.  To me, taste is ok and it is crispy.

The pork ribs is a HUGE problem!! as see in photo, the fats like substance that don't taste like fats is disgusting.  Pork ribs suppose to be lean meat and still have eatable lean meat to eat but this dish has no meat at all. When confronted to the boss, she just said ""ok ok next time I inform chef"" that's all, m... I feel that boss should replace another place for us. It is not cheap though.  I did not pursue for replacement.

I hope I can encourage myself to dine in their stall again."
Nice food here and not too expensive
A good place to have food with the families. Variety of food choices. Next to the beach
"Streetfood heaven. Avoid 6pm - 7.30pm.. it gets crazy and the carpark can be chaotic. Chicken wings and satay are must haves. Grilled seafood the best around. Those tiger prawns+grilled stingray, whoa, best!  Bring cash, loads of it!"
Good place for family weekend outing.  A lot good local food.
"suitable for family of all size night out and dinner with wide varieties of mostly local food - seafood, satay, noodles..
Crowded on weekends and be prepared to wait for table.
A breezy stroll by the seaside complete the good family time.."
"Good variety of local food, price is ok. Partially sheltered so rain could be a problem otherwise a cosy place for a decent meal."
Awesome place
Great seafood affordable options
"Always love to have dinner with family here... Seafood, Satay, cockles, BBQ chicken wings... But always crowded & difficult to get a table"
"All kind of hawker food. Leng Heng zi char, wah ji wan tan mee, beef noodle, duck rice , rojak nearer to seaside and leng heng zi char all are good"
"Ahh, good food by the sea. Little hassle, lots of competitors to choose from. Rejuvenating."
Many varietues of food and drinks. Great for family gatherings and eating with friends. Rated 4 stars because the taste of the food isn't top notch but it's still delicious and great. It's still on top of the line but not perfect.
"CALM, one can enjoy the nature with only the sounds of water waves that makes us feel so relaxed."
Variety of food
"Excellent seaside area, for everyone."
"good foods and reasonable price.
will recommend to friends come to Singapore."
Good variety of food. But lack of seating
"My favourite feast here. Usual cockles, cereal prawns, satay, barbecue wings! Cheaper than Newton!"
"My friend took me there, to eat seafood and Chinese food..
Nice atmosphere, good food, but I think it's a bit pricey (not sure about this).."
Goes well with post camping coconut juice
"One of my favourite Hawker markets in Singapore. The variety of food is outstanding and the Oceanside location can't be beat. Come early because it gets busy as soon as the sun goes down. Come hungry because there is so much good food to eat.

Special things to try include the satay from the guys wearing the orange shirts. It's some of the best satay around. Also there is a stall specialising in bbq pork noodle which is famous and justifiably so. BBQ seafood is very popular and there are many good stalls to find sambal sotong, bbq stingray and grilled prawns. There's one stall that does really nice black pepper crayfish."
Lots of great food though can be hot and humid
"Pretty good seafood. But some stalls weren't open for lunch, probably because it was Sunday."
"Only open in the evening. Not sure about weekends. Alot Che Zhar (Hawker style Seafood) stalls. Favourite stalls are Fried Oyster Omelette, Wanton Noodle, Rojak and Chong Pang Satay and Barbeque Chicken Wings. Have not tried the Seafood Stalls before so no comments. Not a place that tou would specially go if u wamt really good food."
I like satay & bbq
"Love the local food, difficult to get seats though as it's always packed and free seating."
"Delicious local delicacies like BBQ wings, satay, oysters fried with egg, and not forgetting to complement these with a mug of iced-cold sugarcane!"
Lots of varieties of food. Different cuisines!
Nice food with lots of varieties. Good to bring families here
A clean and peaceful place....
Ok lar not bad
Cool place to chill out
Great local food
"Loved it , good blend of local and regional good"
Great place to have dinner at. Quite a number of delicious kind of seafood to taste.
"Giving it a 3 cos some of the regular shops standard of food has dropped-
The fried omelette oysters, nearer to the car park, mywife and I had a stomachache after that.

The fried hokkien mee a few (3?) shops to the left, was BAD, could not continue eating- no color no tase and noodles were hard.

The satay, also just 2 stalls to the left (Chinese satay and selling chicken wings)- meat was well, mushy and have definitely tasted better pork satay, in fact, the pork tasted like chicken, perhaps they mixed the meats?

Bad experience.  See pics for 'warnings'x"
"Great place for seafood., Like BBQ stingray with sambal, fried oysters.  Not forgetting the says here. Good stuff."
"Great and wide range of hawker local food and seafood. Especially my favorite satay and Chicken BBQ very delicious. Selective of fresh fruit juice drink,  sugar cane, watermelon,  coconut etc. Halal and non-halal food are also available here.   Priced reasonable and affordable. Good location for cycling, skateboarding and a walking distance to the beach. Place get crowded during weekends & public holidays .  Parking lot limited."
"Very wide variety of food. Like the satay a lot. Other good food stalls include the duck rice, chicken wing, and oyster omelette. Definitely a must go for anyone visiting Singapore. Picturesque views and a plethora of local delights to suit any palette."
Best seafood
"Variety of food choice, food is tasty.  very crowded. Difficult to get place to sit"
"a good place for gathering n have nice food like seafood ,malaria xiang guo n chicken wings n etc"

Good selection. Convenient for those near east coast. Parking so so. Typical parking shortage during busy times.
"Great food, good ambience but very crowded"
Good place to find food but they starts after 1pm onwards.
Nice place
Nice food but often too busy
"Great food in one location. The place to be for supper, a late night food jaunt and a makan sesh with friends.

Food:
Lots to choose from. We had the fried oyster omelette(orh luak), fried carrot cake, hokkien mee, sugar cane juice, and 2 popiahs.

SGD 4 - Fried oyster was delicious. Crispy where it needed to be, the eggs, soft and juicy oysters, and good, chewy rice flour mix.

SGD 4 - Fried carrot cake, just as good. Portion is slightly small for the price but all is forgiven by the generous serving of eggs. Nicely crisped on the outside, firm and well done on the inside.

SGD 4 - Hokkien Mee, just as good as well! Three prawns, Hokkien Mee was flavourful and delicious, seafood taste coated the noodles well. Chilli helped give it a nice tangy bite, and the fried pork lard was nice and crispy.

SGD 4.40 - Popiah. Disappointing. Ingredients weren't packed tightly, overpriced.

SGD 3 and 2.5 - Sugarcane juice. Ask for no ice if you can as they'll give you a fresh cup instead of a sweetened, diluted one.

Location:
Parking is hard. Try to come early.

Service:
Self serve. Try to find a seat before ordering.

Would I recommend?
Yes. Great place to visit, walk by the beach, and eat."
Love the satay and seafood
"Came to eat the pig trotters and bak kit teh. It's usually very crowded during weekends but weekday lunch is good time.

Meat is tender and easy to chew. The sauce is delicious and not very salty.

Highly recommended."
Good food and enviroment
Nice foods with sea view
Regular food.  More attractive as a beer drinking location with friends after work.
"Really nice place to eat dinner.. cheap and tasty food... Lot of options... Friday and weekend it's crowded, difficult to find place, but 'take away' food and eat sitting in beach sand.."
Classic hawkers centre! Very nostalgic
Nice and clean
Eat street
Good bbq seafood and satay if you know which stalls to patronise

Great variety of food and drinks available. Pricr-wise slightly higher than usual hawker centres. Can be very crowded during dinner time and on weekends.
Just enjoy the food.
great food
"Well I love the vibe of this place, be it a Tuesday night or a Saturday night (although tables are harder to come by on the weekends, but don't get me wrong you do eventually sit after a lot of wandering and asking for seats). I'm a vegetarian, so I was very worried during my first visit if I'd find anything that met that requirement. But then my boyfriend took me to Siam's Thai kitchen, which is about four stalls away on the left of the DBS atm (with the atm being on your left). The uncle there is so sweet and smiling that with each visit to the food court I found my feet automatically walking towards this stall and also, found myself drooling in anticipation of the yummy pineapple fried rice and mango salad (killer combination!). I'd recommend this place for the happy energy, for the lovely sea breeze and the interesting ppl watching! :)"
Food is good but have to wait.
"One of the sea front facing place in Singapore for cold beers and all most all the Singapore hawker foods. Cool, Good and Reasonable price to visit. Highly recommended!"

Many shops closed in the day.
No vegetarian food available.... lots of seafood here...
Sumptuous spread of food available
A hawker Centre that caters to those who are interested in barbecue food and the staff there are very polite and friendly.
More clean toilet please.
Place is relatively noisy and food is expensive compared to nearby food centres.Better to eat the MacDonald then here.
Good food and beach ambience. Always crowded.
Nice food. Good atmosphere
Satay paradise
"Only came here for the satay and nothing else. some are worth it, some are not."
"Food is adequate to good, but a little expensive. As it is a popular destination, the ambience is very unrelated. People are often waiting for u to finish your food so they can grab your seat."
"Used to eat here with family occasionally, usually it's packed especially at night and on the weekends."
"One of the best places for local food fare. Crowded but that's the right atmosphere, you want quiet go to a fancy restaurant. Try the sate and of course the barbecue wings!"
Good Place for Bonding n food!
You Ru Zai Hai Bian Xiang Shou Wan Can!

Amazing. Try fried rice with sour plum juice.
Price is on the high side
Delicious dinner after cycling session
Wide range of local food
it's super crowded during weekend. so many good food. Oyster omelette was my personal favorite here. can recommend to tourists as reasonable priced good quality hawker food.
"Enjoy a stunning example of Singapore's multicultural food culture set by the sea. If you feel guilty about indulging, go for a cycle or jog along the tranquil coast line."
Good food.. Good ambience..Value for money!!!
Great place for a cold beer and delicious local cuisine.
Must try ... BBQ fish fr Musa ijan bakar
Food prices increasing but not quality...
Good food...
Great place for eating
"Been going for nearly 25yrs to the East Coast Lagoon Hawkers, and never disappointed!"
"satay, chicken wings and beer!"
Nice to place..
Good variety of foods available. 3 bicycle rental shops along the whole east coast parkway
Vibrant hawked paradise
Sea side. A lot of food stalls available.
"The only place in singapore i know of selling satay during lunch. good food but most stalls are open late afternoon during weekdays. weekends are nightmare getting a place so visit before or after peak hours. loved their beef noodle soup, satay, fried kuay teow and carrot cakes and seafood and the list goes on..."
It was awesome
Good food. Can be quite pricey. Not much touting compared to newton circe
"Good, cheap food alongside the beach. Cannot get much better."
Cool easy place.
Plentiful food village. Great variety of cuisines and good quality.
Nice place
Alot of nice foods over there but too bad have to pay for parking charges which used to be free.
"The food is affordable, tastes good and has variety. The setting in a major park makes it a special location to have a memorable meal coupled with park activities."
Satay very naise
Nice place to rest after cycling
Very good option for sea food but not much for vegiterian
Several popular stalls to choose from. Serves both halal and non-halal food
Good food. Parking and ATM machine available nearby.
Wide spread of food. Parking full on weekends. Prices reasonable.
Best of local food and atmosphete
This place is hugeeeee... My favourite place to go for seafood and especially nice since on the beach.
Haven't been here in quite a long time and was surprised to see quite a lot of people on a weekday night. One of the more chill hawker centres in Singapore although a but harder to get to unless you drive or take a cab. Recommend you do a bit of research before going because many stalls sell the same food so important to go for the popular ones. I like the ATM machine conveniently located right in the hawker centre
"Love the seafood and satay sold here at hawker price. Meera indian stall,  Musa seafood and Satay stall 1 & 2 are my fav. Normally packed on weekends. Weekdays and wet nights have a little less patrons."
"Nice place to chill out in the afternoon, some stalls are good, alot of them touristy. Its right next to the beach, can take a leisure walk after food"
"It's a pity that some of the older stalls are no longer around.
Stay away during weekend as it's hard to find a seat."
Nice food but almost everyday full house.. Food reasonable price....
Great.. Beautiful scenery..
That's such a beautiful place to relax and there's beautiful foods just beside that's full ur stomach.
Tasty food 
Local muito legal para visitar e comer uma comida local e barata. La vc encontra de tudo da culinaria asiatica. Ainda da para aproveitar e curtir uma praia. Encontrei ate um caldo de cana para tomar.
Awesome AAA.. nice view.. but now the food so so only..
Great food with very nice ambience...
"Value for money Bak Kut Teh, $6 for three large ribs."
Plenty of food selection. Can be pretty crowded during weekend dinner period.
"Have been eating at this open-space food centre for years. There is a huge variety of stalls, both halal & non-halal are available here. However, this place typically opens from 5pm onwards till late at night. Some of my personal favourites are the rojak stall, beef noodle and the wanton noodle(cos they will give you the caramelized charred pieces if you ask). It's alot like Newton Circus,except That place is a rip-off at certain stalls. However, East Coast Food centre is also more expensive than regular food centres. For example, if you order a chicken and century egg congee, it will cost you $5 here. Regular food centres will probably cost you $3.50-4.
Still, East Coast Food Centre has some really nice Malay satay stalls. As a note of caution, do remind them to grill your satays abit longer. Sometimes, when there are many orders, the satays tend to become undercooked. Food poisoning is not what you come here for
Queues can get crazily long at the more popular stalls,especially during dinner time. You may have to wait up to 45min at a single stall at times!"
Many delicious food here
"Many satay stalls all at $0.70 per stick. The stingray, popiah and orh jian all pretty good. Need to select the right stall!"
Sedap food man
Good food at reasonable price depending on which stall you pick! You can't complain about the view since it's at East Coast Park!
very good ambience as you are right next to the beach. Finding a seat to sit is challenging to say the least. everything singaporean food in one place though not all shops are of the same quality. The satay's are yum while crab dish  are very meh
Lots of yummy food there and wide variety.
Expensive and food normal
Good place for great cheap food. Scenic beach view. But bloody crowded on weekends. Have to wait a long time to get a seat. Lights are not bright enough.
There are many stalls and food is excellent
Most stalls are not open in the day but the place will come alive at night. Many local delights to be savoured.
"Great location, cheapest beer with a view in Singapore!"
Hawkers there very cooperative. They assisted one another for food orders. Well done !!
Nice view of the turquoise water.
Bu Yao Xia Yu Shi Hen Hao De Di Fang. 
Great place to get some cheap beer and relax by the water.
Lotsa cuisines..tasty and clean
Great place that's relaxed though sometimes busy. Satay here the best in Singapore and the famous popiah is a must have.
There a really good beef noodle stall and you can't miss it cause it's the only one.
Nice and peaceful place to eat lunch
Lots of options for food..
Early morning breakfast after cycling... mee rebus mee siam gado gado.... are very nice.
"One of my favourite place for dinner. The definition of singapore food hawkers. You have everything you want here. Wanton mee, mee soto, barbeque wings, satay, seafood, fried hokkien mee, char kuey teow, fried rice. Everything you can think of! And the quality is pretty good here too!"
Nice hacker center at east coast park
Nice place to eat bbq
Good satay and mee goreng very lively reasonable prices
Good variety of offerings and food generally good.
Superb place
The best hawker centre in Singapore with a lot of choice of food. My favorite is Hwa Kee Mee Pok and Song kee Oyster. Expect long Q at peak hour but it is worth it. Other recomendation is Satay Harun.
"Best for satay, stingray and all others seafood."
classic sg
Enjoyed every minute with variety of food and shops
Wide variety of local food. Some are quite famous with long queue. Need to drive here. Not So convenient for those without car. Most seats are with shelter.
Place for good malay Satay. 
"Great range of Hawker food, specialising in seafood and satay. Very nice in the afternoon to watch the sunset, but it can be very difficult to get a table so prepare to wait!"
Lots of food to chose from. Price is ok but just to crowded on weekends. A must if you visit Singapore
Nice eating place bt the beach with variety of food with reasonable price
I love the BBQ fish. Sambal Petai.Best of all the Standalone Fried Osyter Stall.
Loads of varieties!! Worth battling week-end crowd for the tasty choices.
"Forget Lau Pa Sat, Newton Circus, Old Airport Road, this is the place to take out of town guests. You get your usual selection of hawker fare at reasonable prices with ice cubes in your beer but you're sitting on the beach! Can't do that with those other places."
Nice place to have satay and barbequed wings but not as tasty as I remembered. Can get very crowded on weekends but there's ample parking spaces around.
Best satay
All type of Singapore food is there. Reasonable price & delicious.
Lot choice of foods.  Great hot chili crabs
More to follow....
Had early breakfast at 9 am after a bicycle ride. Nice!!
"A place that you should go to if you are feeling hungry. Price is not expensive. My personal recommendation is to try ""Satay"" at one of the malay stall. The best satay is the one with the orange signboard called ""Haron Satay""."
Nice price
Good food but getting more expensive.
Cheap and tasty seafood here
Variety of seafood by the beach
Great atmosphere
"Great atmosphere, a really enjoyable night out!"
Delicious hawker food. Wide varieties too
Great food. Decent prices.
GREAT FOOD
It was alright. No more of that nostalgic feels.
Lots of touting. Pricey food
"Love this place. You can get local Singapore food fare here at great prices. Bbq seafood, satay, mee soto, mee rebus, etc and top it off with a refreshing glass of sugar cane. Awesome!"
One of my favourite places for a dinner date.
"Great food, lots of choices and very decent prices. The black pepper crab is to die for the BBQ chicken wings are awesome."
"Great food place, just a little stuffy environment with the BBQ satay and seafood"
Very close to beach
Never gets old. A timeless classic in the Singapore food scene.
"Good location, many typical Singaporean food outlets."
Lots of good food as long as you know which stores to order from. Avoid visiting on Monday as most stores are closed. It's hard to find seats during peak hours so don't be afraid to ask if you can share table.
A cheap place for nice food by the sea side.  Many food  choices. 2 of  the stalls selling  oyster omelette are one of the best around.
"Great food, too crowded"

Great food with local taste
"This place is full of good and affordable local food. Great place to have your meal after cycling in East Coast Park. However, seats are super hard to find during peak hours. Parking is also limited. Alot of the stalls sell similar stuffs, so if you are not picky with your food or too lazy to queue, you can simply buy from other stalls."

Don't go there in the afternoon. Less than 20% stores opened .

"This place is good for people that wanna avoid city area and enjoy the view of beach and tasted the local food of Singapore..

Price range 4-12 dollar"
"Nice mix of local fare. Most stalls opens relatively late into the evening. Only a handful of stalls during lunch time. If not, it would have been a 5 stars. Very busy during weekends and eve of public holidays."
The place is always crowded. Especially during the holiday. Seating are very limited and you may have to que and wait beside the table in order to get a sit. Luckily the food is good. Price is reasonable enough.
"So many stalls must try everything!  Watermelon juice is the best.  Must eat BBQ stingray, oyster omlette, grilled snapper ...."

Plenty of local hawker food to choose from. Good place to eat for both local and tourists. Take a walk along the beach after meal.
Variety food for every set of people
Best food stall 43. Try out guys
Lots of delicious foods
The concept is of a massive food court with amazing bbq and drink options by the beach. slightly overpriced I guess beacause  its a food court at ECP. Weekends get crowded where you might stuggle to find a place. Its in open so you must really hope the weather  is kind. I liked  spending my time there. Hot satay dripping in peanut sauce with  a chilled beer!
"Place for casual dining,  out door,  plenty food option to choose , in front of beach,  so good for children to play around too"
Great seafood
"Pork Leg Meat , one of the best that I have eaten..."

"My family love this food village. It is a must visit food centre. We love the Beef Kuay Teow soup, Grilled Stingrays, Pork Satays, Wanton Noodle, charcoal BBQ Chicken Wings and Teochew Braised Duck.
My personal favourite is the Beef Kuay Teow Soup, the soup is very flavorsome and the beef is tender. Chong Pang BBQ Chicken is very delicious too, not to be missed."

THE FOOD IS TO DIE FOR WORTH IT FOR THE TIME I WAITED FOR A SEAT
That have relatives food it good n very cheap
"Nice location, but the vendors are very pushy. Almost no choice for vegetarians (mainly 1 Thai place)"
Great place to hang out for late supper as the stalls are open until very late.
Nice food centre near the beach. Food is a bit overrated and tbe satay is expensive for what you get but not too bad to have something to eat aftet a day at the ECP beach.
"The chilli crab we ate here was quite fresh, tasty and reasonable. Quite crowded on weekends so better to go early to get a table to sit."

The food here is delicious and the place is  very clean 
its super good if you have friends around and you would like to enjoy the forest and sea for one day and barbecue.
"Simply the best food village in Singapore. Good food, good location and cheap beers !"

"Nice food, good environment. Suitable for family, kids and gathering"
great sting ray and big butter prawns
Good view food not bad also.. but long q for table to eat only...

Realy Good food and a nice view over the sea
Food quite costly nowadays
"Crowded on weekends after 5 pm. Located near the beach. Visitors will be spoiled for choices on the wide range of local good foods drinks. Foods are served on disposable wares, so it's convenient to take it to the beachside for an instant picnic."
I love the Satay & Rojak here.

Very popular hawker center with a lot of different types of food
"Food portion big, scene good."
Over priced poor quality food We left the Hokien Mee because the prawns (all two of them) we're not cooked. Satay was nice but terrible crispy baby squid and sambal stingray. Only gave two stars because beer was cold.
Great place to eat with the locals. Seafood delicious
Great food but beware when coming over weekends. Difficult to find parking
smelly and crowded
Love the fried rice and satay. At least once in a month to have the same.
Wow place so many good eats around.. hard to mention one..

"Had dinner there and all were nice as the food were served fast and hot. ( stingray, gonggong, fried oyster with egg, satays and cuttlefish with kang kong) Not as crowded as compared to long time ago. I like the fact that they renovated the place with washing tap and soap provided."
Reasonably priced yummy food
Serve one of the best hawker food in Singapore with seaside view. Location would be a problem for people without cars.
Lots of variety but can be crowded

Awesome duck rice.
Awesome! Best Hawker in Singapore
Can enjoy Chinese and foods and beverages
Halal food available.
The Singapore hawker food is found here. For some reason because of the proximity to the sea this place is great for conversations.
Not a clean and hygienic place to eat. Tables always not cleared. I won't come here again.

Many famous local foods you can find here
Very good food. Wide variety
EXTREMELY GOOD FOOD
Nothing exceptional
Many different varieties of food here. The place is huge
"A bit dingy but, houses a wide array of local hawker styled food. The main gripe is that food sold here are mostly served on disposable Styrofoam food ware that makes it very unappealing to dine on and also it is very unhealthy plating practice."
"Top of Singapore hawker centre,  along with few others in Singapore.  Very good selection of food,  Chinese,  Malay, Indian and western style. Come early for dinner,  particularly on weekends,  as this place tends to fill up very fast."
Must know which shop selling best satay
Great place for grilled seafood and other local delights.

Nice hawker foodies.
Trop cool plein de bouffe ideal pour manger le soir
"$7 for 10 satay, for me that is a steal. Good, freshly grilled meats served quickly with a nice bowl of peanut sauce and some fresh veggies. Honestly, that's all I needed and it was exactly what I got!"

"What a great place to eat!? I'm from Malaysia so my level of delicious Asian food are ... a bit higher than usual. This place has it! Go for the chicken wing, satay, o jian and so many more. When order coconut, go for the big green one, NOT the little white one. After a nice delicious local meal, you can go for a walk. Except the queue to order food is a bit crazy Long. So try to arrive earlier than dinner time."
Good standard  had drop as cpmare to last time.  As for the price is getting more expensive.
A nice outdoor food stall by the beach which has numerous local delights that is very popular among the locals.

Great food options. Weekends and Friday nights are the most crowded times.
Excellent to visit when holiday...
The satay is the highlight of this scenic location.
Good variety of authentic local Singaporean cuisine! Prices are about the same as other hawker centers in Singapore.
Food quality is average. Would not be travelling this far in future for the food that can be found in heartland areas
"This place gets packed during meal times. The food is unremarkable, price is much higher than other hawker centers. The layout of the place can be improved; too many dead end and unlevel pathways, preventing easy navigation. You can expect to wait 1 hour for a seat and another 1 hour of queue to get food."
Storrd Not open before 10am
So many seafood choices! Lots of satay stalls as well which is always fun. Went on a very busy day and still got fast service and found tables.

A variety of seafood
Smelly busuk
"Nice place for local seafood that's reasonably priced. Lots of stalls offering seafood like stingray, squid, fish and prawns, take your pick.
BBQ chicken wings here are good as well, many drink stalls to patronise.
Quite a number of satay stalls around here as well.

Decent place to have dinner after a long day of cycling or rollerblading.

Can get a bit warm at times due to the crowd and all the cooking going on. Finding a table might be a small challenge during peak hours, especially dinner time. Parking can also be a bit difficult, so arrive early. Best suited for medium sized groups of 5-10 people.

Pro-tip: Disembark at the parking lot and let the driver settle the parking. Find a table first before ordering, split up in order to maximise your chances of finding a table fast. The wait for the food is fairly short, so don't fret ordering first."
Loads of variety

"If you are a visitor to my beautiful country, please head down to this food sanctuary, where you get great local food at reasonable prices. Will be jammed packed on Sats and Suns but its worth.

"Feast at East Coast Lagoon Food Village

If you happen to be basking in the sun or participating in some recreational activities at East Coast Park, you might want to drop by East Coast Lagoon Food Village for a meal. Opened since 1977, this food centre features many long-standing hawker stalls. You will find that many of them are now run by 2nd generation hawkers. The curry fish head from Eastern Red Seafood stall and Popiah from Lagoon Carrot Cake stall are good for sharing. The curry is thick, with just the right amount of punch, while the popiah is generously filled. Every bite consists of a great combination of textures.

On rainy days, you can savour Bak Kut Teh and Pork Trotters from Han Jia Bak Kut Teh. The latter is so tender that its meat will melt in your mouth. Supper-goers can share a plate of satay. Remember to dip the succulent meats into their homemade satay sauce for that nutty oomph!"
"happy dining place, a must try place for dinner, Satay and Seafood. fairly priced and good quality seafood."

Satay at Lagoon Food Village is so good!
This is the place I tell any friends that are just visiting Singapore for a very short time to go to. It's not too far from the airport and the hawker centre has a great variety and is by the beach. There's a huge range of satay stalls and some do pork satay.
Satay and seafood is great
I love this place .. nice food ..
Most affordable place to eat compared to the restaurants over here.
Nice beach view
"This place is mainly for Singaporean, so it may not too clean. But the price and food is amazing. Just the location is not easy to get to here."
Chicken wing. Stall 14.  Beach bar. Jacky beer garden. Seafront music beer. Lots of good local food. Explore take time to come early like 4 pm plus for sea facing.
Good number of good food stalls. Can't go wrong with the beef noodles (soup) and char siew rice/noodles.
Cool. Very crowded at the night of the weekend
so many food stores here.  love it.
A good place to have meals when at the beach.
hard to find table on weekend
"Quiet a bit of options for food. However did not notice Indian food.  Can get nice chicken wings, sea food etc. Gets crowded on weekends."
Nice beach good food
I like this place because I love the food there
Great food!
Fine place
As Singaporean as it gets. If you like hawker food then this is the place to go!
"Unmissable!!! Especially Roxy laksa, THE best"
Great variety of local fares. Albeit pricey though
Pretty nice spot for a family outing
A lot of places to choose from close to water skiing
Serves local delights. Price is slighly on the high side. Else the food there is generally well worth paying for.
Amazing selection of halal food and quick service.
Lovely robust local food place. Reasonable price and quick service. Finding a seat for large group might be quite a challenge.
"Love the wings, rojak, chicken salad, cai tau kueh and orh lua among other great food. Check out the uncle selling craft beer"
Cheap food and drink at East Coast Park.
"A great place to go for a family, but it is very crowded on weekends - you will have to 'fight' for a seat. Also, be prepared for your clothes to smell like satay and chicken wings. Apart from that, the food is really delicious!"
Great food and nice view
Food too exp and the serving is small nt really nice
variety of food here
Good location by food is mediocre.
wide selection of local foods. seats got get limited during bad weather as most will get wet
Really great place to try out Singapore local dishes next to the seaside. 1 star less because its always smoky and stuffy with oil fumes.
"Hawker by the beach. Fairly good beer selection. German, Australian and even Czech beer there."
Sweet place overlooking the river. Very easily via a car or just simply cycle over. Have a drink and some seafood with friends!
Yummy ! Great food and drinks !
Good food man!
Best place for evening relaxing...  East coast beach Park
Lots of good food in a nice environment!
Great Food Street Vendors
Great variety of food. Nice place to come after cycling.
V osnovnom morskaya eda i eto ne superdeshevo. Kachestvo tak zhe na 4.
Foods are quite okay
Good place to chill n good BBQ
Varieties of delicious food but can be a problem getting seats when it's crowded during dinner time and weekends
"Local food by the beach for chilling, for refill, after a jog or walks.."
"Local food heaven, great to take for a walk after dinner with the loved!"
Nice hawker food
The place is pretty much like a huge hawker centre with plenty of cuisines. Many choices. But each stall opens and closes different times which is a setback
Good open air place to enjoy a variety of local food ... then go for a relaxing walk along the beach.
They have the best Pork Satay with crush Pinapple in the Satay Sause 5
Treat for non vegetarians sea foods
"Too crowded,  even though it is very famous.  Finding a a seat and getting cheap food is tough.  Avg meal costs more than normal food court prices across the city"
So many choices of local Singapore food
Great hawker flare by the beach. Decent prices.
Tranquil place to eat at during lunch. Ate my favourite duck rice which for years is still awesome!
Good place for food. I recommend the ginger tea
The hawker food here is awesome! Die die must try!
Fantastic food for seafood goers. You will be spoilt for choice. A single trip isn't enough to finish trying every dish let alone stall here.
"Many food option, affordable, just it will be little bit hard to find empty table during peak hour"
Cheap price and tasty food.
"Dong Xi Duo,You Hao Chi,Qie Ping Jia ~"
Good place to hunt for halal food
Great open air place. Some wonderful stalls. Especially like the Satays and the Thai food counter. Great offers on beer as well.
"Wu Mei Jie Lian,Ben Di Ren Qu De Di Fang"
Must try the duck at Cheok Kee
You'll find the best chilli crab at a very cheap price
Not enough variety. Way too many seafood BBQ stores. Food is decent and is reasonably priced.
"Lagoon carrot cake (4.25/5)
The white carrot cake here is the crispy type, the egg is crispy and fragrant. While you can still taste the fragrant of the carrot cake.

Popiah (4.25/5)
The popiah here is quite special, their popiah has a crunchy bite to it and its thanks to a ingredient inside that made it have a crunchy bite. Their chilli was also very nice. One of the best popiah I eaten."
One of the best food court in world
"A hawker place that offers many variety of food! Come during a cooling day to enjoy all types of food. On a hot day, not recommended as it can get pretty sweaty! Very reasonable priced food also."
Seafood was awesome and delicious satay
"Good variety, nice and relaxed location by the sea but rather average food. Go for the location, not the food."
"View and food, all in one for a great evening or lunch break"
Lots of variety of food accompany by sea breeze. Thumbsup to famous eateries like Hwa Kee BBQ Pork Noodle.
No atm nearby
Good variety of food located near the beach. Really good satay stalls to choose from too. Good mix of people having beers when most of the food stall have closed.
Favourite hawker center in Singapore. Seafood and satay are fantastic. Also has a low-key good chicken rice stall.
Must try the braised pork knuckle. Best in Singapore.
"Great food,  great location."
Great range of good options
"It seems much local than Lau pa sat or Newton food center, while more touristic than normal local hawker center in towns. Price are okay and foods are more than average."
Delicious and affordable food but not easy to get there unless you have a car
Good food! Go early.
Always crowded!! Next to impossible to find seats. Food used to be good but I found it disappointing this time.
Lots of food
Love the duck rice store here! It's always long queue and you can easily spot it
Nice food plus good pokemon catching location.
"Wide variety of food options, cation some seats have no shelter against rain"
Good selection of local Singaporean food
Great selection of food. Walk around and check out the places with locals queuing is usually a good indication. Some really great food to be had and some inexpensive beers
Ou Er Jing Guo
"Local food,  top"
Personally it's a good chill out area with a good selection of famous local food.  I particularly like Jackys beer garden and chicken wings &  satay.
"Lots of food, can be difficult to park."
quick fast food and have a stroll along the beach after eaten
Best place by the east coast beach for local food.
Try popia and coconut juice.
One stop Singapore local delicacies. Smoking table available!
"Beer, Crab and music - awesome place for hangout - I will remember #Hoegaarden all the way with that shellfish."
Here is the place you can find more than 10 satay stores.
"Food is good, not pricey, no pushy touts. Can get quite warm on a hot day though, even with the renovation."
"Good food with a great view. Whats not to love here. But do go research the good food here as there is many stores selling the same food, with differing standards."
Teddy wings are my favourite!!!
"All kinds of food provided here, from Malay food, Indian food, Chinese food, European food. Though prices are not so cheap but you can try out everything here. Big spaces for kids to run about and nice sea view."
One of the best located hawker centres in Singapore. Hard to get a table during evening and a bit more pricey but everything is fresh and tasty.
One of the best Hawker Centre in the East with lot's of nice local food.
"Nice eating outlets by the beach. Variety of food is good, from satay to crab beehoon (rice noodles) to local laksa (spicy coconut milk rice noodles). Drinks are plentiful but  tend to be expensive, with a small coconut going for $2.50 and a large one for $3.50. This is nearly 50% more than what you can get elsewhere! The crab beehoon at $50 is also expensive. You can get two crabs for $48 at Old Airport Road Hawker Centre! However, if you have just enjoyed yourself at the beach front, cycling, para-sailing, etc then it may be worth it to end the day at the hawker centre.  Be prepared though to wait for a car lot as it can be a squeezed during peak hours."
"Great food, a tad bit overpriced. Come early before usual mealtimes to avoid jostling for seats"
"Carparking can be a nightmare.

But the food are worth it:
Satay-Musa Ikan Bakar Stall
Braised Duck-Cheok Kee Duck Rice
MENG KEE SATAY BEE HOON"
Quality food for reasonable price
Food food food
When I am in Singapore this is the place where I eat.
Nice place to have local delights at the beach
"Wide variety of food but restrooms not maintained, parking space limited."
too much varieties of local food... most of it satisfactory... good view if you sitting nearer to the sea side... but do expect a long queue... this is one crowded hawker...
"many variety of seafood at one location
usually crowded and got to wait for about 30 mins
best time to go around 6pm"
Solid selection.
"Hawker food by the sun, sand and sea. Prices are marked up, but clearly indicated on the billboards."
Great selection of satay and seafood stalls.
Lots of pokemon =x
"Name a sea food, you get it here.enormous options..vegetarians-stay away"
Wide food selection by the beach. Suitable for both locals and tourists
Excellent venue for family gathering.
"See breeze, nice view, decent food and beer. What else do we need ...."
"refresh in the ocean next to it, chill with an ice cold oolong cha while gazing over the massive ships lining up along the horizon like oversized dark pearl silhouettes.."
"Huge variety of grilled food in the evening, and some nice food such as Braised Pork in the afternoon."
"Food is relatively overpriced for suburb, but quite reasonable when compared to restaurants nearby. Look out for the delicious wanton noodles stall with a long queue."
Great hawker food
Our fav haunt for local food and seafood. The price is incomparable as well
Hands down the best place for fresh seafood in East coast Singapore for great prices.  Our go to spot when we don't know where to have dinner because there are so many options.  Too many good things I could write here.  Be patient while finding a good table and just be polite when someone asks to join your table if you are 2 sitting at a 4 top - it's the Singapore style to share tables.
Kong Qi Hao
great place for local food!
"Lots of choice for seafood lovers, less choice if you don't like seafood,  surprisingly given the number of shops here."
Nice place by the sea.  Good food and festive atmosphere.
A short ride away from the airport. If you're in town and unable to travel far for local delicacies. This would be the place to come for great local delights.
Abundance food choice
Great stingray and satays (Haron 30 Satay).
"Located in the park and by the beach, this hawker centre serves up a slew of local cuisines from satay to chilli crab. It's the perfect place to indulge your guilty pleasures after a run in the park."
"If you like BBQed hawker food, this place is a good place! The chicken wings are quite good from stall 14. Other than that, theres a lot of seafood stalls. Else, unfortunately there isn't a wide selection of food here."
Great place to eat... all local Singaporean cuisines are available.. halal food is available..
"Come to east coast food lagoon must eat satay, bbq chicken wings, and bbq food. The place is rather clean."
Good western food and stays.
The mutton satay is awesome!!!
Terrific outdoor local food center. There are tons of stalls where u can buy delicious food. nice and bargain!
"Great place to eat by the beach.
During the day time most of the shop will be closed.
At evenings it can get very packed with people."
Slightly pricey for hawker style local food. A few stalls offer decent quality food and are often recommended.
"As of May 22nd this place is NOT permanently closed (according to Google), It was one of the best meals we had and definitely go beyond the satay and eat some fresh crab, cockels, and etc.  Highly recommend this place, though tough to get a table so you may have to wait or hover over people but worth the wait or go early.  And if they did think about closing this place down one day, which they wouldn't , but if they did you would hear  there are plenty of famous seafood spots down the way to eat at if you are making a special trip out here to eat."
Great food
Awesome food
"Located along east coast, the food village offers a good variety of food items. It is a good place for family / friend to dine out. After meal, you can take a walk along the beach. There are ample car park lots."
Nice food good environment
so many sea food to try there
"If you're going on a weekend, make sure you arrive early as the place can get crowded during peak dinner hours 6-9pm. Cheaper and less touristy than Newton Circle, can't go wrong with BBQ stingray and chicken wings."
its famouse for a good reason. expect parking hell on weekends.
Cheap and variety selection
"Always a great place to eat. Busy during weekends and weekday evenings. Washrooms can be rather dirty, so best to bring your own wipes to clean it up should you need to take a dump!"
"This place is so bad. So many stalls selling the same kind of food, it's so difficult to find one that actually tastes good. Go somewhere else."
A lot of tasty choices of food after run....
"+
Excellent food choices.

-
Touts at times."
A q aequo lol jp xe
Great place especially for dinner!
"Lots of food variety from different stall. A good place for local food like satay, BBQ seafood, chicken wings,wanton noodles. Could be quite busy over weekend evening. Make sure to be there early to get seats."
Excellent sea side hawker food with many famous stores
Good alternative to the restaurants in East Coast park. A wide variety of food in here. They serve ice cold beer! And ice cream!
"Crowded, not too clean.  So hard to get a table that you need to roam the area for 20-30 min. Lots of touting seafood hawkers.  If it wasn't for the location, AVOID."
"Local food taste beside the beach.
Consider not bad. I like it.
After dinner can go walk by the beach"
Beer prices are great...plus good value food..and there is a variety...
Took me awhile just to get a table during weekend. Try the zichar stall in RED(2 shopspace) right beside the blue stall!
Make sure you try the curry chicken puffs
A nice food court next to the beach. This place is vibrant with so many food stalls serving local delicacies. The chicken wings are very good but as they are extremely popular there is a long wait time. The place is open so does get a bit messy after rains.
"Ca doit etre l'ancien Foodcourt de East Coast juste avant d'arriver au club de planche a voile en 1984. Aujourd'hui le club de planche est deplace sur Pusat Water Venture plus vers l'ouest
Il semble ka cet endroit, y a un pont permettant de passer au dessus de ECP"
the duck rice is a must try
"Nice place to find good local food! There's Satay, Laksa, Mee Pok and Briyani! Come here in the evening for more food options because most stalls are closed in the afternoon... The BBQ food here is rather popular!"
A nice place to find Local Singapore Food surrounded with with nice sea view. Sometimes it is hard to get a spot.
Delicious food by the sea at a very economical rate... Thumbs up!
"One of the best hawker centres you can go to with many must try stalls. Besides the obvious seafood and satay stalls, the orh luak (oyster omelette) is also famous as is Roxy laksa. The duck rice is definitely worth trying as is the home made curry puffs. And this is just a shortlist. So much good food that you'll never finish it at one visit!"
"Lots of selection of local food catering to everyone, perhaps not so much for vegetarians but you can always eat before you join the rest.

You have to come here on weekends, well worth the wait, the queues and the heat!"
Good food centre with a large selection of stalls. Its open air but with covered sections. Can get very busy on weekends so be prepared to stake out for a table.
"It's a food village, what else?"
"If you wanna enjoy some delicious seafood without breaking the bank, look no further. There's a wide variety for you to choose from; crabs, lobsters, prawns, etc. Great thing is, you get to enjoy your meal by the sea. There are lots of seats around; sheltered, with umbrellas and without. Highly recommended for reunions or gatherings. Tho, it can be very crowded on weekends despite the huge amount of seats this place has. All in all, a great place to satisfy your taste buds and tummies. And it's always a must to get BBQ Chicken Wings whenever you are here."
Good food. Often crowded.
"A food center with quite a lot of choices. There's the famous wanton mee, Muslim side of various foods. Open air with quite a lot of seats around"
"Great selection of street eats. Focus on the satays, bbq chicken wings, stir-fried or grilled seafood (yes, it will cost a little bit), and oyster omelettes. Don't get tempted by starchy stuff such as rice or noodles -- you can have those some other time or at other locations. Bring a spare set of clothes and mosquito repellent since you will want to walk along the beach a little bit and take in the sea  breeze -- view would be spectacular except that it will be spoiled by numerous tankers parked off the coast!"
Great location with a wide variety of tasty seafood! Definitely somewhere where you are spoilt for choice. One of my favourite places!
Food! Love the laksa and BBQ wings.
Nice Food but expensive. Difficult to get parking during peak periods.
Great location by the sea. Lots of choice of stall. The won ton mee guys near the seafront/carpark side are great!
"
Singaporean? How can you still need a review here? Tourist? You can't miss this place for pure good local fare and history"
Best place for a group dinner. I can vouch for the Satay on sticks....
Pretty nice all round hawker food experience. Good spot near the seaside promenade to end the day after a good walk.
Awesome place
Top notch hawker centre -- look for the longest lines to find the best food.
post code 468960
Had butter crayfish at stall #4. Amazing stuff!
"Nice food, wanton mee, satay, satay bee hoon, beef noodle and more!"
"One of Singapore's most popular hawker centers. Get satay at Haron's (stall no.55). BBQ stingray and sambal kangkong is also a must try. Hard to say which stall is the best, just look for the one that's busiest."
"It's quite remote so not much people know about it. There are some stalls there that is good. Specifically the noodles and nasi lemak. The place is not very crowded since it's inside industrial area and the food is not very expensive. The atmosphere is not the best, but still withing acceptable range."
"Chang Di Hen Da,Ge Shi Mei Shi,Su Shi Jie You,Hen Tong Feng. "
"Spacious food mall with lots of seats. Stalls sell local delights ( with halal food stalls and a vegetarian stall with vegan options).
The vegetarian stall sells delicious and affordable vegan / vegetarian food with no alliums. Their vegetarian curry fish head ( with rice ) is one of the best in Singapore, highly recommended."
Stalls come and go pretty fast.... the ban mee/ fish soup stall pretty decent... the wan ton mee is also pretty gd... the rest are so so....
Good selection of food... not that affordable and dirty enviroment. Wanton mee too bad
Mala not bad
Not much service but the food are all nice. Food court is big and airy. Free parking too.
"Foods is ok , but while waiting for table on one clean up . The place is too hot, hence adding more fans will be a better solution."
The fish porridge / seafood soup is very nice here!
"Look a little rundown.
Need an upgrade."
Quite a big food mall with varieties of local delights. Only problem is the place is quite isolated.
$9 fish soup if you can afford
"Its next to mom's cooking. Simply love the mee rebus, laksa and lopis."
Especially at evening got steramboot got chinses deluxe 24hr coffee easy parking

"Food is OK, variety of food is acceptable, some stores do have nice dishes, atmosphere is so so; abit warm during hot days.

Update 08-2023
After renovation, they painted the roof and did minor Reno, but the stores remain the same"
Fish soup there is nice but abit pricey. Portion wise is a lot.
"Newly renovated. All prices seems like oso increased. New & clean toilets available. Thought in industrial area shd b cheaper, actually no. Citizens might nt haf a cheap option having a meal here."
Renovation from 1st Jul  to 1st Aug 2023
"Good place for lunch in the weekdays as this place is in industrial area, with a big screen Chinese songs, big overhead fan."

"Spacious seating
One&Ton noodles 
Ho Yeah Nasi lemak stall,  the curry chix 

Zi-Char today (21/05/2023) v disappointing. Have to wait quite a bit  before our simple dishes were cooked and served. The table ahead of us were given full attention (in my opinion), should have followed them, order 2 steam fish & medium size plate for other dishes 

Updated on 21/05/2023"
Very spacious
Beer is somewhat cheap ! Good supper place ! Western is good! Affordable! They have Vietnamese food too!
"The malay food stall is tasty and good value for money.
Sadly the Vietnamese food stall has moved out. Their Oyster was cheap n fresh"
Nice foods and affordable pricing
Nice seafood soup with rice prices increase through
"Yu Tang Hao Chi,Gou Wei. Ye Jiang Fan Ye Hao Chi. Duo Zhong Mei Shi Ke Yi Xuan Ze. "
"The fish soup is great. A bit pricy, but the taste is good. Lots of ingredients too."
"The ban mian stall here is great. Can add fried fish & fried egg. However the queuing system is strange, u queue to order one 1 side then queue again to collect/pay."
"Very spacious kopi shop, very good mix of stall to satisfy ur hunger. I especially like the Bak ku te as it reminds me of my childhood days those stalls at River Valley. The clear soup base with powderful pepper."
Fan limited.  Noisy
"Friendly staff nice food, cozy environment"
"A huge canteen in an industrial estate. There are a lot of seating area available, it's very airy and open, good for gathering. They even have a LED wall with speakers. The drink stall serve beers . On a safety note, not advisable for drink  and drive . As there are ample parking lots around, for families and people who drive would be convenient to even grab a quick bite."
Located in the heart of the industrial estate. Lots of stalls to choose from. Decent quality food with affordable prices.
"No. 10 Xiao Chu Kitchen -

Assam Fish Head for $19.00 is not bad . Sorry no photo.

Hor Fun - Got wok hei. White one though. Not much lao. Large $10

Salted Fried Rice - Got salted fish and bean sprouts. Taste not bad but still lack the salted fish taste into fried rice. Large $10"
"I came at 8pm, there are 5-6 stalls still open. Most of the customers are men drinking beer."
A very quiet and nice environment.  Vietnam food too expensive.
"Expensive place for industrial area! Expect food to be $4++ and above. BKT Bak Kut teh going for close to $10.
But there's a good variety of stalls ~ 10 selling all kinds of cuisines.
Cleanliness (floor) could be improved though."
"I find this place very airy - there are a few those super huge fan. The huge fan really can move air.

There are many nice stalls and it is open during the weekends too!

I went there during the weekend and quite easy to find parking around it too."
Great place to go for lunch. Very few parking options available.
"Visited this place few times during dinner hours on weekend. Left few stalls opened at ard 6pm. The western food is not bad, impressed with the variety of choices for side dishes. Ordered a chicken cutlet and a carbonara. Cutlet is tender and crispy while the carbonara is creamy but slightly salty."
"Super attitude store especially the oldmen and the lady cooking. They will scold And super reluctant to pack  if u r using stainless steels food carrier they will scold n grumbling making them difficult n so hot for them to pack & will make sarcastic remarks by saying ""next time we won't pack for u if U come with this""
Fine, big deal to buy from u? Don be proud when u think ur business r good. Is just a matter of time. I swear I won't be patronizing ur stall anymore. Fish soup small size need to pay $8 fxxx... X
Instead another stall which selling wanton noodle is equally good and so much cheaper then their food."
Good foods
Fish soup best
"Awesome mee hoon kway! The handmade quality is great! Chewy flour.. soup good, the fried fish must order. If their chilli is same as lor 32 would be best. Location is way too far for me..."
"Ate Lok Lok + rice + soup, quite exp but still okei

I am a vegetarian, so it got mushroom Lok Lok, so gooodddd."
"One of the neighbourhood coffeeshops located within Marsiling Industrial Estate.

Coffeeshop is huge. Lots of food options available for our Chinese friends albeit a limited Malay & Indian food thereat.

Parking wise, in abundance.

Another plus point is that, the coffeeshop closes late weekdays. Around 11-12 midnight depending."
Easy to locate and contains many stores that are selling and reasonably lower price than regular foodcourt.
"Zhe Li Zao Shang Mai De Shi Wu Bu Cuo,Ka Pei Ye Huan Hao He. "
"The zhi char beside the vietnamese stall are better than the other corner. Try their steam fish, so fresh and sweet. Overall the foods are nice and not expensive. The only things expensive are the drinks, the prices are like petrol kiosk."
"Always lunch with my  friend who is working at Lam Soon. Have try the Nasi Lemak, the fish soup, chixken rice. All all very good..."
Food taste ok but no cheap as compare to others industrial canteens
"Excellent Fish Soup. Well ventilated and spacious.

Parking is limited. Also don't come around 12.30pm if you can. Busy busy."
More variety of food at 1 place
Not much food choice
"Place is clean and tables are well spaced out due to Covid-19. It has one of the best seafood soup stall with fish slices, 2 big prawns and bak choh. Goes well with a bowl of rice."
Can Ting Niao Luan Fei Ying Xiang Wei Sheng. 
Excellent seafood soup
"Good one ton mee , nasi lemak , ban mee"
Best 1 ton mee so far
Good Halal Chicken Rice Stall.. serving is generous. Coffeeshop is clean n airy.
Stall no 11 - Kawan-Kawan Chicken Rice sells affordable and tasty chicken rice! Ordered food for my family and they enjoyed it. Highly recommended! Staffs there are very  kind as well.
"Best Hainanese halal chicken rice serve at this food mall. Kawan Kawan chicken rice. Formally from blk 136 Marsiling Road. Currently, it's MUIS HALAL certified cert is still under processing since it's transfer to this food mall."
5 stars for the wanton Mee. Got pork lard so crispy so shiok. Chili spicy and the noodles nice also.
"Food prices are reasonable, service excellent n big space dining,the marsiling 136 kawan kawan chicken rice also relocated at here!!"
"Economical food, good safety distancing seating arrangement and a good selection of local foods."
Nasi lemak not bad
Different stalls available. Most of the stalls open from Monday to Friday.
"Food mall is quite clean and ok. I tried the Long Sheng Charcoal roasted delight, pretty normal. The roasted duck does not have the Herbal taste and bbq pork at bit hard. Coffee is rather bad though."
stumbled into this area and found this food place tucked in a corner.. food okok but place is spacious and windy.
"Toilet too far ... Need to renovate
More nearler...thks"
Good place to eat. Nice ba ku teh n mee siam
Quite hidden...
"Came here to have dinner and order Thick Bee Hoon Sliced Fish Soup from ""Flaming Wok"" stall, the soup taste abit salty for me

Get China Apple drink for $1.60"
"JY mookata was great, variety of dishes were there and relatively affordable.
1 star for the location and flying cockroach which slapped my face aggressively "
You Bu Tong Shi Wu
When i saw the sign it temted me to reach for some apple but when i went there there were no apples later i realised it was the garden of eden it was a food court
Cleanliness need to have more effort
Food cheap & good
A huge place with great food.
Good place to enjoy meal
Lunch time
"Eden is a large hawker center right in the industrial estate. Filled with loads of seating area, I enjoy the fact that it is easy to find a place to have meals. Unfortunately, during the off peaks, crows peck on leftovers."
"Very crowded during lunch time on weekdays, especially after 11.45am, cleanliness could use some improvements. Alot of birds trying to pick the food on the table, so be careful."
Shi Wu Duo Yang Jie Ge Bian Yi Hen Hao Chi Zan Zan Zan
"Ban Mian!what a rough stall owner! I had been scolded which just ask for separate the noddle and soup! When I was ask for separate the noodle and soup, the stall owner ask me stand aside n wait in very unmanner way! After 4 person order then make my order! What is this?! If not becoz My friend ask me to pack the food for her, sure I will scold him and move away! Will never never never buy their food again! Rough! Unrespecful!"
Di Fang Hen Liang Kuai Wei Zi*Hen Duo
The pau at the coffee stall need improvement.
The food is average but the place is big with no air conditioning
Spacious & bright and more  importantly come with a Vegetarian stall.
"Hen Xi Huan Zhe Li,Chi Fan Bu Yong Pai Dui. Xin Kai Liao Yi Jia Ma La Xiang Guo Wei Dao Ye Bu Cuo . Zhi De Lai Chang Shi Yi Xia. "
Took our family here after a great Play at Admiralty Park. Everyone was happy with all the classic Hawker food we loved. We ordered 4 different meals from 4 different stalls. All were made with really fresh ingredients. Highly recommend.
"Try the fish soup at this food centre, very nice n flavourful, lots of fish meat n big prawn. Good deal!"
"Bah kau teh very good seefood soap very others not sure,parking good"
Su Cai Hao Chi
"Love the pig trotter from bak kut teh store and mixed vegetables rice. However, the pig trotter is expensive."
The ban mian and seafood is very nice.
Tablets and chairs are not clean
Should maintain cleanliness and open more Malay stalls which can offer nasi lemak for breakfast
Tables were dirty with bird droppings. The Ban Mian stall is good and long queue during lunch. But not a nice place to dine.
"It is not air-conditioned, and there are only a few food stores opened on a Saturday afternoon. The coffee and tea...let's just say that you are served coffee- or tea-flavoured milk drink. There's Wireless@SG. So if you need to hang around somewhere while waiting to pick up your child after class, I think it's a place that you can consider."

Huge hawker.. Cheap and good.. The mix and match rice stall is extremely cheap
Delicious food like ha cheong kai and baby squid. However would not recommend curry fish head as it has too much coconut milk in it unless you are a fan of it.
Tasty food. N clean.
It around industries estate very large area but lack of variety ok ok for breakfeast and lunch food store close early only coffe shop
"very dirty n food not cheap there,will never go again."
Very delicious seafood soup.
Good local food
Nothing to see here. Move along
Food not too bad
Food is generally ok. But the seating area is not very clean with birds flying and table and chairs are soiled dirty.
Limited choice of food as quite a number of stalls are empty.
One stall has popular offerings.  The rest are average.
The fish soup is good but long queue at lunch hour.
Right inside Marsiling Ind Est.
The food's alright.
Only hand make noodle store food is nice
"""Free parking"" as seldom have attendance. Nothing special on food. Fill up stomach or drink coffee then ok"
Regular lunch place in rustic conditions.
Value for money
"Eden Food Mall is a place where you may not want to be at if you prefer a more hygienic and comfortable place. It is an open-air food court, and thus birds fly about in the food court frequently. The food offered is also okay, with some stalls charging lots of money for small portion of food (e.g.: seafood stall sold a half crab to us when we ordered a full crab).

However, some stalls do offer good food, and there is also a stage in the middle where performers can perform."
"Hidden ban mian spot - give the dry version a go! Peak hour starts close to 12pm on weekdays and the stall starts getting confused over everyone's orders. Go before 1130am if you can for lunch, unsure what time it open till for dinner. Seafood soup at the same stall is pretty good too!"
Mouth-watering fish soup and other delicious food worth the travel
Spacious airy place
Legendary ban mian
Fish soup is great
Little variety of food and stuffy
Hidden gem for ban mian/ seafood soup. Expect a long queue.
"expensive food court near industrial area. The place is close to my office, that is the only reason i choose to have lunch there."
"These canteen belong Factory area .provided breakfirst, launch and dinner."
Untidy and i have never seen anybody cleaning the whole area. Anyway good food options can be seen.
food below average. not expensive. ordered the tom yam soup n pineapple fried rice. the soup ok but the fried rice so so only.  won't eat again.
Only place you can eat Thai food at food court in the Marine Parade area. Reasonable pricing and good variety on the menu. I'll come back.
"slow service and food taste really bad (nothing authentic Thai). Food has not much taste.

Forgo this, Go across the road and have authentic Thai food."
Good honest people. Delicious food. Will be back.
This is my 3rd time eating here and the rice still uncooked. Felt like eating raw rice. Please do something on the rice. It was very hard to chew the rice
"Horrible service, 30 mins wait and food wasn't even nice. Not gonna try this again, waste of time and stomach space. Saw another lady order basil chicken/pork with rice but there was no visible basil on the plate."
"Not nice. No basil flavour, just taste of dark sauce and also had a bit of a funky taste to it."
"Ordered Sabai set with basil pork.  I think can call it as soy sauce pork. Hardly taste the basil.
The rice was so mushy. Thai should cook rice better than this.

Thai basil pork rice should come with runny egg. But the egg is so hard !

Overall I think wont buy.  3 stars cause the soy sauce pork is nice even it's not spicy and lacking of basil"
Ordered Sabai set 2. Thai Milk tea really CMI. Not enough milk and the colour is off. The Pad Thai is generous in its portion but taste wise not authentic. How do I put it ~ tasted too much of ketchup.
Food was cold and not tasty. The spring roll they said was home made was so cold that I can't even pierce my fork through. The green curry was also cold and it didn't seem authentic to me. Only lemak taste and they didn't even use Thai eggplant. But just pieces of local egg plant instead. Very disappointed. The lady boss even said authentic Thai cooks. But I am very disappointed.
"Chicken pad see ew is not bad, quite fragrant but chicken was a bit dry"
"Loved the omelette and the golden tomyum hotpot, the portions given was worth every dollar!"
"On Monday 14 April 2025, during the grand opening of Kopitiam Food Hall at Parkway Parade, I had the green curry seafood fried rice with seafood Thai omelette for my lunch at the Kopitiam Food Hall food court in Parkway Parade, and I liked this meal as green curry seafood fried rice with seafood Thai omelette tasted very delicious. Overall, the service provided to me was very good and I would love to try these other Thai dishes (except for pork and beef) from the other Egg Thai outlets in the future."
"Despite its name, it doesn't actually serve a lot of Peranakan dishes. It is more like a Chinese caifan stall, with a few ""Peranakan""-ish dishes like chicken rendang, nasi lemak, and sayur lodeh. The other dishes are typical caifan staples like sweet and sour pork, deep fried dory, tofu, and stir-fried vegetables. Still, it is one of my favourite stalls at Marine Parade Central."
"1 veg 1 meat and 1 otah for $5. I thought the size of the rice serving was okay, despite other reviews that said it was small. However the serving size for dishes was small and to be honest, they just tasted so-so. Best thing in the box was the otah, the other two were forgettable and not worth the calories."
"Small portion and quite pricey ($4.5 for 2 veg 1 tofu) for a ""caifan"" that is located in a hawker centre. Tasted pretty normal like other caifan, don't understand whats with the long queue."
I'm addicted to the taste! Love the many dishes available! Each dish has it own unique taste which I can't find anywhere else. And the purple blue pea rice is a must try! Very unique and unassuming Cai Fan!
"Portion sizes have decreased drastically  While taste is decent, I will not be patronising anymore "
Love the nasi lemak blue pea rice. Can't compare to anyone that I know so far. Cheap and nice
"First try and probably my last. Order the nasi Lemak with additional brinjal for total $6.50. The chilli portion was pathetic, the rice has no fragrance only the chicken is just ok. But they shrimp on the gravy and chill which is the most important component. Portion is small as well."
"Fortunately I did my research, else will visit the wrong stall. Xing Long cooked food stall already sold to new owner. The cook (daughter of Xing Long founder the mother) open her stall at the same food center with a new name 'Emmanuel Peranakan cuisine'.  The bad news my favourite ngoh hiang no more on the menu. The good news, all the previous xing long dishes are here. The queue at peak hours tell you that the stall remain popular and quality of the taste remain the same. Her dishes are simple but she is an excellent cook. I had rice with black bean bitter gourd and bite size pork belly, steam egg, sweet & sour pork and otak cost me $6. Very worth it, I had a hearty meal. You want more rice you have to tell them, because of health reason, masses generally eat less rice. I am glad the daughter decided to carry on the mother legacy, else will lose this traditonal home cooked food taste."
I never had such crunchy broccoli and Chap chye in a caipng before! It's so delicious and fresh. The curry chicken topped everything off nicely! I don't feel jelak or extremely greasy after my meal. Thank you for the wonderful food!
Nice home cooked mix vege rice but pricey. 1 veg dish is $1 and portion is tiny.
"The Peranakan nasi lemak is a disappointment. Tried the standard set ($5.50) which is blue pea rice with rendang chicken, fried egg and ikan billis. Added a piece of otah ($1.80).

The rice was colorful but totally tasteless. Looks only. The rendang chicken was pretty much the same. No aromatics and no spices. Just mushy yellow gravy. Otah was passable.

Overall prices are also high for a public hawker center with portions small."
First time trying the food. The vegetables was tasty.
"Finally found the old taste of xing long Econ rice in the same hawker at this stall. Shd be the same chef.

Had the normal rice with curry and the dishes below. Total $8. But its tasty n clean. Portion is small but just nice for me. Will be back to try the nasi lemak soon."
"Good value for money. Fried fish, blue pea nasi lemak, egg, vegetables for only $4.50. Queue may be long but it moves fast enough."
"Looks like a run of the mill caipng stall, but their execution is outstanding (try their fragrant blue pea rice and anything with rempah / gravy, and don't miss their excellent sambal). Prices higher than a usual caipng stall, but well worth it."
"Although it says Peranakan food it is really just Chinese economic rice.

Definitely the tastiest Chinese economic rice stall in Marine Parade hawker centre. The cook was from the popular Xing Long Cooked Food stall (no longer tasty) in the same hawker centre.

But I'm irritated that they charge 20 cents for a normal styrofoam box and always give so.... little rice."
"Emmanuel Stall at Marine Parade Food Centre is an absolute gem! They sell normal rice and dishes but what I always come back for is the nonya blue pea nasi lemak. The chilli packs a punch too.

I normally order fish and vetables with the blue pea nasi lemak.Price is decent for the taste as well. Actually the other dishes go together with white rice is good too. Been a patron of this stall since this is my home ground.

Not only is the food exceptional, but the service is also top-notch. They take great pride in their food, and it truly shows in every dish.

The ambiance of the food center is bustling, adding to the overall dining experience. It's a great place to enjoy authentic Singaporean cuisine.

Emmanuel Stall at Marine Parade Food Centre is a culinary delight. If you're in the area, don't miss the opportunity to savor their delicious offerings.

Do take note they are off on Tue to Thurs.Also blue pea nasi lemak only avail on Fri to Sun."
"I've always wanted to try the Nonya Nasi Lemak at Emmanuel Peranakan, which is one of the more popular stalls at 84 Marine Parade Central Hawker Centre.

No luck this time either, so I went with their regular Nasi lemak. Took fish fillet, chicken, begedel, tofu and fried egg.

Rice is very ok, not flavourful. I liked the begedel and the chicken. Fish is well cooked. The egg and tofu weren't good - quite bland and didn't seem fresh.

For $8.5, it's on the more expensive side too."
"Food is cheap and good! My favourite stall in this hawker centre!! Love the rendang, braised pork belly and chap cai "
"Super expensive, small portion veggie with minced pork cost $2, white rice also super small portion, finally sweet sour pork with 2 veggies cost $5.50 yet still need to buy 2 round of food. Will never visit this stall again."
Permanganate food
"Absolutely fantastic Peranakan-style nasi lemak (with blue rice).
The chicken rendang is really exceptional, the otah is quite good too.
The sambal is okay, although not super spicy but very flavourful."
"Best hawker at Marine Parade! The blue pea nasi lemak is fragrant, savory, and delicious. I like to get the eggplant and curry veg as well. The sambal is not very spicy but the flavor is nicely. Personally prefer this over the designated vegetarian stall."
"My perennial favorite hawker stall. The menu is wide. My favorites will be fried chicken wings, cod fish batter, bombs, fish otah. The curry gravy is heavenly. This is a place whereby you can have a decent meal at a decent price. My only grouse is that they should open more during the week."
More like mixed vegetable rice than peranakan food. They dont sell buah keluak or pongteh. The Nyonya Nasi Lemak does not taste nice. The rendang chicken is very hard. The blue pea rice taste okay. They are stingy with the sambal. My own opinion it is not worthwhile $5.50.
"Delicious, especially the fragrant coconut milk rice n the sambal"
Honestly very pleasantly surprised how good their nasi lemak is.  Probably the best I've had in a long time!
Special purple rice  Nasi Lamask.
"I ordered a Nasi Lemak with additional toppings such as chap chye and otah to go. When I returned home, I realised there was no fried egg nor peanuts and anchovies in the nasi lemak. So upset!"
I had the curry chicken and rice and I must say that was one of the thickest gravy I've had. Not spicy at all. But still delicious.
Presentation is nothing like the picture but the taste of the chicken rendang is amazing!
"Friendly stall owner and chef (Mdm Annie) informed me that they are closed on every Wednesday and Thursday.

Enmanuel Peranakan Cuisine Stall 01-30 is located in 84 Marine Parade and Food Centre, next to the Parkway Parade Shopping Mall."
"Disappointing, serving was small and curry chicken was very tough with insides dry."
I am here on Thursday but not open.
"A long queue for patrons formed up to pack food home at $0.20 extra.
At least 20 paxs were in front of us, waiting for the packs"
"Decided on a whim to try this stall because of the long queue during this period. Ordinary looking but don't be fooled. The chicken rendang and Nyonya nasi lemak is a must try. Really love the sambal chilli too which is very fragrant and slightly tangy, not the usual sweet type. Food isn't too spicy too. The rice is very fragrant and delicious and goes well with everything! Only wish there was more Ikan billis (tiny anchovies) to complement the rice.."
Looks ordinary but the taste is quite good. 
Blue Nasi lemak and meaty ngoh hiang are my favorite
"LOVE their sayur lodeh!! This dish of theirs hasn't been getting the attention it deserves - it's creamy and strong on the coconut milk - probably one of the best I've eaten!

Their blue pea coconut rice is pretty interesting too: it kinda has the texture/flavour of the glutinous rice you find at the bottom of kueh salat haha and so it's stickier then usual and has a mild sweet fragrance to it.

Would definitely dabao my lunches from here if I stay around the area. It's somewhat pricey but well, it does taste better than the other mixed veg rice options out there!"
My go-to place for caifan at Marine Parade. Can never go wrong with their meaty ngoh hiang containing pieces of chestnut and their aromatic curry vegetables. Very affordable also.
"Friendly shop owner and reasonably priced. The Nyonya nasi lemak is a nice twist of the usual one with excellent chicken rendang. However, the sambal chilli isn't super spicy."
It's food and there's some taste to it but I won't call this nasi lemak. The blue pea is a novelty that wears off fast. I think best to go to the authentic Malay store instead. But I'd get the rendang on its own. Very nice!
"Love their food! It's the best!!! Have been eating their food for the last 20 plus years. FYI - The owners of this stall was the previous owners of the Xing Long Cooked Food stall. They are the original owners of that stall (before the Reno) for the last 20+ years (that had the crazy Long queues) but moved to this stall called Emmanuel Peranakan Cuisine after the Reno. Therefore, the current owners of Xing Long are new owners."
"Really love their food,  authentic and home cooked style.  Need to come early to have more variety and freshness.  Yummy and highly recommended  "
"March 2025 - Belated posting

Been buying from this stall regularly x few years ago. Both the auntie and uncle friendly.

I am giving 4 stars for atmosphere as I usually takeaways. Hence, do NOT take my rating for this into consideration 

Suit my taste as NO onion Garlic or leeks (allium family)"
"Nice fried rice, especially Xiang Chun fried rice $5, +$1 for fried egg sunny side up."
"One of the Vegan/ vegetarian stalls at Marsiling Mall Hawker Centre. Food contains no alliums ( onions, garlic and leeks), hence suitable for religious vegans/ vegetarians.
Do inform the friendly uncle if you don't want eggs or milk in your food."
"Had their bee Hoon for breakfast, it was delicious! the char siew is good! Will frequent this stall 

Update Sep 2024: seems like the portion gotten bigger. Yummy. Not sure why some pple say the uncle unfriendly.. he is always friendly to me every visit."
First time see a stall serve cold ice ba Kut teh ? Ordered take away . And was ice cold when opened need to reheat ownself. How to eat??? What a joke from this stall . Will let others know about this incident pls beware of this stall . Check ur orders u might get uncooked stuff/ingredients.
"Located Marsiling hawker centre, at 3rd row. Aunty is friendly, cdc voucher is accepted here. 3 dishes cost sgd 14.50

Love their minced meat eggs, super delicious!

Chicken rice is turmeric yellow rice, like brayni rice rather than frangrace chicken rice, and its sticky and lumpy. The chicken basically is the fried beacurd skin, taste like zai er, its crispy. Overall, taste still acceptable but you might need to order drinks to go with as whole dish is deep fried zai er.

Fried kuey teow still okay, abit oily,  missing wokheey aroma."
"Dinner there and surprisingly found a nice vege zhi cha there.
They usually open until 8plus. So don't be so late if u wanna try."
"Xie Xie Lao Ban,Lao Ban Niang,Te Bie De Xian Yu Chou Dou Chao Fan. Chou Dou Xian Yu Du Shi Da Da Li De"
"Way too much ingredients for this $4 vegetarian sliced fish noodle soup, there is even some vegetarian sliced fish ball and vegetarian meat strips too, lucky day for me!"
Must try their sinchew bee hoon and hokkien mee! Not a vegetarian but I patronise their store the most!
"Tried first time today. Ordered curry noodles and old ginger black bean soup. Curry was heated up from leftovers in the tray, old ginger black bean soup just tasted of salt and ginger. Will be the first and last time to patronize the stall..what a disappointment, travelled all the way down from clementi after seeing the good reviews"
"One of the best vegetarian stalls ard woodlands/Marsiling. I highly recommend the Ji Ba Fan(cutlet rice) and Ji Fan(chicken rice). Very crispy and good, I always order it for lunch/dinner."
"First time trying. Somewhere 4.5 points.
Located near escalator, back corner area.
Stall assistant young lady is very helpful and trying to assist.
Veg Yam ring - $22
Veg Stir Fried Spinach - $7
Veg Orange Sauce Pork Rib $10
Veg Cereal Veg Prawn - $10
The prawns feeling abit floury
Above meal is good for 5-7 person, with rice."
Patronise only needed
Delicious and big portion
Uncle very rude
Great food
"Huan Hao,Zhu Yao Shi Di Fang Gan Jing"
It has unique recipe
Not as good then before.
The food is good.
"The prices ok
Food good"
Mala hot pot is good
"Hen Hao,Hen Xi Huan. Di Yi Ci Lai. "
"Too much fried stuff on their chic rice , honestly vegetarian should be healthier with lighter stuffs.. the stall has many selections of foods and definite suit patrons who likes fried & oily foods ! Overall price is reasonable"
Nice taste.
Affordable and delicious vegetarian food. Dont forget to try the hokkien mee.
Wo Xi Huan Chi Ma Lai Chao Mian Hen Hao Chi 
Nice vegetarian food. Nice boss
Very good options of vegetarian food. Good pricing.
"I am not a vegetarian yet found myself patronising this stall more frequently over other attractive options within this hawker centre.

The quality of the food are pretty high standards, comparable to some of the higher end restaurants. I especially enjoyed the beancurd dishes despite the higher prices."
"rainy day, I was really cold and hungry.
found this joint in Marsiling Mall. ordered the herbal soup with rice set.

after the 1st sip of the soup, it was enough to trigger the hungry beast. 5 mins and I've finished both rice and soup. just too good to believe!!

got to try the remaining stuff when I have the opportunity! you should too!!"
Yummy food with affordable price!
Nice and cheap vegetarian food
I like their Ginger black beans soup which is very soothing with tinge of ginger taste. I even ate the chunk of ginger that is not fibrous at all.
Good food. Restraunt standard at hawker price!
Fantastic eggplant rice and its value for money.
their spring chicken and wings are great. portions are big and satisfying.
Had the best meal for the night I ordered teriyaki chicken rice and was recommended by the two staff when I wanted something with rice..will come again thank you!
"Fark you rude staff.

Have put a notice of budget meal $3.50 however always say no stock and no rice.

Scam shop"
"Very rude attender, couldn't have patient to hear what customer says"
"Best fish burger
Hao Chi"
"After reading the review I'm regretting my order, sent in a grab order for supper for 2 pax, they decided to cancel 1 of the order and proceed with the other. Now I have 1 set to share with 2 pax. No phone number to contact. Nothing. Grab support sucks as usual, wonder why this place still has 3.2 stars. Cancel the order if you can fully fulfil. Pointless to eat my supper alone isn't it."
Shows that closes at 0230 but when It went to order at 2 they said that they have already closed.
Ordered many times bcs not much choices on foodpanda. Disappointment every single time. I feel sometimes they purposely delay your order till foodpanda got to cancel. Also often get wrong or short orders.
The staff very rude.
"Very disappointed with the food. Been a long time customer. Always changing the sauce of the burgers without informing. Fish burger mayo sauce, suddenly become cheese sauce. Mix up of orders frequently when ordered through food panda."
"bought the signature spring chicken. for a halal restaurant, its quite surprising the chicken got blood and undercooked la.

taste wise ok, but need to improve on SOP to cook it properly."
"Very rude staff, frequented here multiple times and was always served smelly and spoilt food. I saw them dumping bags of coleslaw outside their store, not refrigerated before. And when my colelsaw and pasta order came, it tasted sour and smelt very bad. Told the staff to cook properly and they rudely told me off, tell me dont order if I unhappy. Very poor hygiene practices."
Staff just very rude and bad service.
"Didn't usually leave a review, but lets make this a special case. Was deciding on what food to order, thus took slightly longer, and FYI theres no one in queue. Due to this incident, the malay staff choose to ignore me for order until another staff came in to took my order. Afterwards processed to ""key in wrong buzzer number"" 2 time while laughing. If this is how they allow their staff to work. I can only see 1 future for this brand.
(Date: 18th May 2024, EST. Time of order: 20.40++pm)."
"I ordered nuggets, they gave me fries instead. Super angry! I HATE FRIES!!!! Threw the fries in the bin!!! wasted my money!"
My all time favourite! My cravings will always get satisfied here. Get their Crispy chicken burger it's the best of alland it's just $5.90. Better than Mcspicy.
Just pass by
The staff must be sleeping because I ordered chicken wings and the gave me fried chicken chop like what is this service
"Super disappointed..pls don't go to
This outlet ..boikotttt

Pasta there is no salt in it , fish no seasoning , beef burger patty Taste like it was made 100 years ago ..

The cooks at this outlet should resign and work elsewhere maybe at the nearest hospital where most of their customers who  buys their food ends  up there ..."
I got the Crunchy Fish With creamy pasta. Fish was crispy and tasty. Creamy pasta was bland and tasteless. Service was normal. They can definitely do better.
Very good and delicious food yummy
"The food is okay but your staffs need training. He is rude and sarcastic. Maybe he needs to realise that he's there to work and not play with phone. I don't mind the food if the service is good. But if the service is bad, even if the food taste good, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth"
"terrible cheese fries. the cheese was so watery, in my mouth it felt so gross. ordered the black pepper chicken chop supposed to come with mesh potatoes but they gave us fries instead? asked them why they never give us our correct dish according to the picture and they say finished so replaced it with fries? would've been better if they told us before letting us make our orders.."
"This shop used to be really good when I just moved here 4-5 years ago but the standard has drop ALOT. I'm not exaggerating. Not consistent with their food. Nowadays, it's always bland."
"Stuck up cook. We politely asked about the food status, then the cook shouted IF CANNOT WAIT DONT WAIT LA!"
"ordered some sides, cheese pasta and mashed potato. the cheese pasta was sooooo cold, I'm assuming that the fusilli was boiled long ago, and they just added cheese sauce on it. the mashed potato had a distinct sour taste, it was soooo bad I'm afraid it could be spoilt."
"terrible service. staff was rude and continued chatting up and fooling around even though there were a lot of people waiting for their food.

ended up waiting almost 40mins for 2 mains on a monday night. food quality and taste weren't fantastic either. fries were cold and mashed potato had a sticky-goey texture."
"asked for a takeaway after food wasnt finish, the employees there looks like they didnt like that we asked for a takeaway, unbothered to help. bunch of hive minds"
Disappointed with the new menu . Bring back the old menu please . Bring back the crunchy chicken with rice . Portion was definitely lesser than before .
"Abit crowded during peak hours. Food is nice when eat here. But for delivery, there's where food becomes soggy."
Ordered fried fish with spaghetti + 1 chicken wing via grabfood. The portion of the fish is sO SMALL for $10??? the taste is really mid too. the chicken wing is dry and not crispy as well. Would not recommend at all.
Ordered fish & chips and requested for mayonnaise & tartar sauxe but it didn't came....... i wonder what was the stuff was doing..... maybe that also explained the fast delivery 
"Yummy food! Mom & my hubby had the succulent chicken chop - which we all couldn't resist and had a bite off their plate; Dad & I had fish & chips which came with pretty decent mashed potato and fries with a generous sprinkling of Cajun powder and lots of mayonnaise- hmm...yummy; my cousin and sis had beef burgers- so juicy! We were not disappointed with the food. In fact we were delighted. But be warned: only one super busy man operating the whole Food Kiosk...be prepared to wait. Also, hard to find a Table for more than 6 persons. Yummy food but good luck with service and seating. Also, make sure to check the receipt - don't be charged for take-away if all you've ordered is for dine in.

Final but important point: this Kiosk is in a Coffeeshop that has one of the cleanest toilets in Teck Whye. (Well Done coffeeshop management)"
It's no longer here..wasted my trip coming down
Nice western food. Must try.
"Used to be 5 stars but however after renovation and change of staff. The new staff are rather rude and uninterested additionally possess a callous yet smirk attitude.

Food wise is decent, however very inflexible with the changing of side dishes. Even if ur willing to top up to get fries or something, they wont allow it."
"Dry & burnt beef patty, even knife & fork cannot poke through

Supposedly have nacho cheese sauce, but today it was spammed with unwanted mayonnaise.

coleslaw was dry & not nice.

French fries supposed to be seasoned French fries, but it was only partially seasoned with patches of seasoning.

Missing cutleries even though I asked for it"
I order chicken chop with spaghetti was charged teriyaki chicken with spaghetti and was given chicken cutlet with spaghetti. Went back to change and then realised that chicken chop with spaghetti is not in the new menu after they revamp. The food portion is so small that it only fit 1/4 of my stomach. With the price I would rather order kfc or chic-a-boo. Or order from blk 166 western stall. This will be the last time I will order from them. Btw the whip potato is cold. Unlike kfc is warm. 
poor attitude
"I must be in parallel universe where this is considered ""roasted wings"" "
I feel like this is the best fatty bombom outlet. We had our meals delivered and it was so good. I bet it's even better dining in! Fish pasta was too good didn't managed to take before pic  and i was not expecting the excellent doneness for the ribeye. !!! Thank you for  leaving us a note to inform us we appreciate it 
Saw them on social media and went ahead to try. It was disappointing.
"Honest opinion, 2 BIG CHICKEN FOR MY CRUNCHY CHICKEN for $7.90. Sorry I forgot to take photo because I too hungry, but the portion is huge ! Don't forget to add the $1.00 CHEESEY SAUCE !"
Affordable and good western food 
I place an order for cajun chicken and end up getting the friend one ... and worst theres no que no nothing...
Like its' name suggests eating it everyday will make you fat. However having it occasionally is worth your calories.
Very slow cooking speed waited very long for food
Have eaten the food there.Twice . To me I feel the food don't taste as good as the first time. Not to my liking.Other stall there still not bad.

"Worst ever experience at their Marsiling place. Ordered takeaway $30 worth, staff said he didn't have change for $50. Asked me to look for change. When I suggested he ask other stalls, he raised voice n said he was busy. There were 2 staff and no customers at all. So I cancelled order and walked away. But such bad attitude is just not acceptable. Hope these 2 staff get some training to improve them or else Fatty Bom Bom will lose more customers soon"
"Very busy during peak hours, need to wait very long loh"
"Food is good, can try. It's also full of food delivery guys so you know many people are ordering as you eat. Less 1 star because for it's price I expected as slightly bigger portion, I don't know maybe I'm just a fatty who needs bigger portions everywhere! Lol.
Ambience is similar to any coffeeshop.
There's a POSB ATM nearby so it's convenient.
There's other shops along the block it's at, so you can buy cheaper cigarettes at the shop instead of the higher priced ones from the coffeeshop.
It's near Marsiling MRT station."
Nice western food with some local delights. Worth trying.
"I waited more than 30mins for my order on a non-peak period and I still see the staff walking out for a smoke while his other partners were busy fulfilling orders with queues and people piling up at the stall. If you want to find a quick fix for meals, please do not order from this stall unless you have lots of time to spare.

Updated: They even got my orders wrong."
"Group of guys forever chatting and not doing anything. Had to wait 30mins for a burger, heard from delivery rider that they wait up to 1hr"
"Food standard is dependable on the days, sometimes it is really good to be honest.

But I was turned off when I saw the cook trying to open a pack of pasta by knocking it on the floor, this floor is where everyone walks with their shoes on, it is also wet and dirty. When he noticed that I saw what he did, he went back to the table and open it with scissors, does this also mean that he already knows it is wrong?

There seems to be no hygiene, I can imagine the worse, considering how they can be so lazy towards picking up a scissors. I have since stopped patronizing them."
Great location to rest
"Order BBQ chicken on a NON PEAK HOUR and gave instructions to change Fries to Wedges.

What i received

BBQ CHICKEN WITH NO BBQ SAUCE, NOT EVEN A SINGLE DRIP

CHICKEN BURNT

FRIES WASNT CHANGE TO WEDGES

WHAT ARE U DOING ???"
Went to do a self pick up using Grab. Experienced an extremely rude staff. How can you scold a customer who was just asking if his food is ready for collection????
Good place for dinner
Standard drop liao 
Food not nice for the price
Poor customer service
"Staff not wearing mask, no doneness for steak asked.

EATING DURING COOKING, AVOID AT ALL COST"
There is not much taste to the food.
Business too good
Parking was difficult. Food was good.
just order the food for my family :) It's nice and generous. will buy from here next time
Still the best western
"The lamb smelled so bad and taste was even worse, it was so hard to bite. A real waste of my money"
"Decent western food with affordable price, I like their grilled chicken with Cajun sauce."
Terrible waiting time. Always short of manpower. Food taste just ok.
Walk-in ordered for 6pax and waited for 45mins. Later found out that cashier lost the receipt and kitchen was not preparing any of my order. Very lousy service. Newly opened period was ok but service degrading over time. Such a waste.
Good food but long wait due to demand.
"Food is over price not worth the money, not hygienic  and the price on signboard with what u order is totally different... will not go back again.. they raise price too scary 4$ fatty bom popcorn now they selling at $6.5 yet the portion so little... LOL... the food just so so~ rather get opposite western better choices"
Good food.
Superb should try the mega burger. Worth it. Super delicious
"Food is ok but pricey for a coffeeshop western stall. Wanted to change coleslaw to rice but cashier did not allow it even though both are the same price. She also gave me a very black face, as if she didn't want to take my order. Tartar sauce was not packed in a separate container and got all over the bun and fries. What do I pay the 30 cents takeaway fee for? Won't be buying from here anymore."
"Rude staff, wanted to order food but didnt respond to my call. Repeatedly called out to her and she looked at me, but decided to continue doing whatever it is she was doing rather than attending to customer."
The sirloin steak is been too long in thw fridge when its serve the meat is really  so soft not actual meat.Fries cook too long
Nice Mala hotpot
Foods are norma..
"Loved this place, good food."
Food is 5/5 but the Indian lady (cashier) make it 1/5.
The food n service is good but unfortunately the packets given or help yourself should improved be spicy or hot..some kind of tissue or wipe provided ...appreciated..will commends/feedback when I go for my next visit..tks
Ordered crispy fish roll. The bun and the fish taste not bad. It is crispy and not oily. Ordered a few times and the quality is consistent.
"Went to buy lunch for the children on 28/3/2021 at 12.28pm, was told by the cashier (Indian guy) that we have to wait for 15 - 20 minutes for the take away so we just ordered. After waiting for 20 minutes, the food was still not ready so we went to ask the cashier who told us to wait for 1 more minute and so we waited again, but still not ready. After that we approached the cashier who told us that they based on the quantities we ordered so they cooked the less quantity for other patrons who came late first, which really make us so angry. After that he told us that the popcorn chicken which we ordered has dropped onto the floor due to our chasing of the food, I'm really speechless, so this is your way of doing business?? And in the end we got our food at around 1.05pm.
Location : Block 167 Woodlands Street 13"
The food is nice and affordable but sadly the service was unpleasant the cashier was so dull looking cant even give me a confirmation on my order had to tupe it down and show it to her
Average food quality.
5star Western delight
Taste not to die for. Inflexible menu. Generic packaging for dine in or take away. Unfriendly staff
"Dear Bom Bom boss,

Not sure if you are seeing this feedback.

Ordered the Chicken Cutlet. Have tried to request the casher a female indian lady if it is alright if I can don't want the Fries and can top uo with more coleslaw. She then replied no. So i ask her but i already said i doesn't want the fries. Then she reply then the fries is part of the set.

Then I reply. Since you said that you don't want to give me the fries then why are you still charging me the full set meal price?

There is a lot of attitude problem with this indian lady."
Too much grease on my black pepper chicken and steak was way overcooked and dried. Coleslaw tastes old and soggy.
Pepper grilled fish is surprisingly delicious
"The food is very oily, I can't finish it!
Food is one stars
This 3stars are for the cute lady at the counter"
Sizzling chicken chop is good valu for money.
Very good shop
"Located in the ST 11 Coffee House at Blk 167 Woodlands Street 11.It is quite near the Marsiling Mrt Station and just by the road, so easily accessable.Parking is behind the Block at HDB car park or at opposite HDB car Park.The taste of foods in general is ok, but of course taste differs individually.The prices of food are at average coffeeshop prices.Usually busy during Saturday and Sunday dinner times.Will take some waiting
time for your order during these busy times.
The stall is Halal Certified.

The food has improved from the last time I went there but I wouldn't recommend it unless you are lazy and hungry when you are near it
"Extremely slow in preparing the food. Dine in waiting time almost taking 40mins++ for the food to be ready.

They prepare take away faster compared to dine in!!! Take away about 10 to 15mins the food is ready!!!

Totally disappointed with their services."
service was prompt and fine. food was not as nice as i hope it would be. the steak was too thin and under seasoned.
"The stall offer a lot if varieties of Western Food like burgers, steaks etc"
"Honestly the best fish and chips I every had at this price. Also frequent the cajun chicken. For the cajun, would recommend eating there for the hot pan. The mash potato could need some improvement though or change to salads."
Grilled chicken was charred. Fried chicken fry till so dry. Taste bad. Not gonna buy again.
I prefer standard beef burger set with SGD 8.2. Burger is Ok to eat. My favorite is the seasoning powder on the fries. A little bit spicy and savory.
Good place to bring your family
"Had a Cajun Chicken Burger. Service was fast but food is mediocre. Meat is not marinated through. Once it become cold, the taste of frozen chicken is obvious. Fries was ok. The biggest disappointment is the chose of bread. It taste powdery and falls apart quicky. The shop use paper box for dinning in. I think that is cool."
Too surfeit for me
"Disapointed today my son ordered, cajun chicken n pasta is cold, steak half warm. Last week ordered delivery fish and chips was also cold. Will not order again."
"Disgusting, saw the way they prepare food."
Order 2 set or black pepper chicken..they give me spoil chicken..taste sour n smelly..will never buy from this place again..very bad
$8.20 beef burger. 5 mins walk from Marsiling mrt.
"Order 3 chicken burgers, one fish roll and 3 piece chicken. The restuarant missed out my fish roll. No contact number to call them. Had to take the trouble to call grab food"
We ordered the Jerry's burger and the black pepper grilled fish. The wait was at least 30 minutes as they had a lot of grab food orders. The fish tasted ok but the portion was disappointing. Not enough to eat. The Jerry's burger patty was very dry and overcooked. The fries were over fried and undercooked. Quality is really bad perhaps because they are rushing. Don't think I will be back again.
Good good. Good service.
"Services sucksss!!! Bad atitdue! E steak and e lamb hard like rocks!! Worst  steak i had never
eat again!! "
"Food tastes great, big portions of food given for a somewhat cheap price.Not bad."
"Visited a few times, but no consistency. Moat of the time i get my fried food overly fried.. Fries served is not hot. Recommend to order grilled foods instead of fried."
Definitely a disappointment. This is my 2nd time ordering and again they messed up my order . First time order through grabfood and they gave me a spoilt chicken. Tasted sour and smelled really bad ! Lucky i was not sick and i let them off once .But tonight again they messed up my order !  Order lamb steak to go and lamb steak was not even in ! Please do something about this ! I had to return back to your shop just to get my lamb steak that u guys forgot to put in . Atleast double check and have a 2nd person to confirm before u pack the food . I hope this will never to anyone or ever again .
Just another Western food
Serves up great Halal western food here with good portion.
Mediocre and overpriced
food is ok
"Order arrived and it was really horrendous looking! The patty was so badly charred that we could even smell it from outside the packaging!! The fries was dry and tasteless. What were you guys thinking serving such food? What's worst, both of the different orders were charred yet you guys actually still sent it out for delivery. After removing the charred portion..my goodness there's barely much to eat. It's too thin to be considered a patty. "
"Ordered through Foodpanda. Totally Fail, from bad to worst. The food was cold, the steak was tough and difficult to chew. Only the chili pack is fine!"
"Food is normal,  the staffs are racist and rude. No more next visit"
"Sometimes the food taste amazing, sometimes its disappointing. Can give it a shot if other nearby stalls doesnt fancy you, but dont have a high expectation from here."
Nice beef burger
Nice pop corn chicken
"nice food, recommended!"
Waited for 40 minutes for a chicken. Worth the wait? No. Price? Normal
2 coffee shops located opposite each other. Conveniently located near Marsiling MRT.
Nice western food in marsiling mrt area
Nice food.
Food is arrived slightly later using GrabFood. I ordered the $15.90 norweigen salmon. It is tiny!! I am so surprised. A $7.50 chicken with rice looks so much more filling. DO NOT ORDER from this restaurant. It is simply a scam.
"Delicious food, just long queues and waiting times"
Specialty: Cajun Chicken Chop. 
Great hala western food at an affordable price!
Ordered at 5.57pm but food arrived at 8.05pm. Veryyy late.... Luckily food is good..
"Literally the worst stall I have ever eaten at!

Staff service was extremely bad. All the stall owners were extremely reluctant to attend to me and the wait time is around 15-20 minutes during non-peak hours. One look into their cold and dead eyes could tell you that they would rather be at home.

Steak was hard. Rock hard.  After about a few minutes of chewing, the only taste that Is left in your mouth is the soggy stale taste of overcooked beef. The black and charred fries were way too salty and some of them were stuck to the hot plate. Rough patches of burnt fries literally cuts your tongue and throat.  Absolutely disgusting.

Cutlery was sticky and dirty. Didn't give me any tissue to wipe it clean either. Even the tomato sauce bottle was dirty. Wouldn't be surprised if I woke up tomorrow sick and  nauseated due to food poisoning.

Terrible store."
Not much varieties on their food
Got the grilled fish. Portion is small and taste wise is just fine.
Good food.
Extremely Long waiting time regardless of delivery or personally travelled down for their food.....procrastination is their middle name.
Sauce too salty and price for a coffeeshop western food is too expensive. There are many better ones around. So try if you wish.
Food is ok but serving time is extremely long despite low crowd during the time of visit.
"It's weird when there are 3 cooking crews and while I was standing to order food, all looking uninterested in attending to a customer. Finally took my order after 5 mins of waiting.

I have to wait for another 30 mins to receive my black pepper chicken. The chicken portion is pathetic and wonder if the chicken required 30 mins to cooked. The interesting part is during lunch time is normal for the service to be slightly longer, but there is only 1 more person queuing after me.

The best part is to receive my burn fries! Other than that, I won't recommend it to anyone, period!"
Affordable and good halal western cuisine
"Good food, but be prepared to wait during peak hours."
Not I eat 1 hon!!??
Stated open at 11 but opened at 12+ . Waiting time is really Long . Waited for over an hour . Food is meh . Never coming back
My lamb steak was tender. Portion of food is just nice.
"I ordered the Spaghetti with Cajun Chicken which was nice, but the 40 minutes of waiting time is certainly unacceptable."
"The outlet of the store seems surprisingly aesthetically pleasing but I'm sad to say the staff and food serve is tremendously disappointing. For the staff, I ordered grilled fish and fried chicken. However, the lady did not ask if I would like to have the rice set or the fries/bread set and simply completed my order. Within 2 mins after ordering, I realised that there's a rice set but they refused to change my order stating that ""order has closed but you still can top up at additional $2 cost"". As my dad couldn't take fries, all he had for CNY eve was the small piece of fish and bread. *the fish is really shockingly small* As for the chicken, although the portion is okay, you can taste that the oil they used have been reused many times. It has a burnt after taste and the batter of the chicken is tasteless. I'm extremely disgusted by the whole experience. If I could, I would take photo to post it up. But I'm sure when genuine customers, not those who are paid to type nice review, visit the store they would have similar comments. Having to wait for 40mins is forgivable during CNY EVE. Having to serve poor food quality is.... Try at your own risk!! Would not recommend."
Decent food.
"Waiting game is strong on this one.
Smoked about 4 sticks with 5 mins intervals.
Then came my order.
Once, they told me i can't carry out or takeaway,
Bcos they got no packaging.
Open quite late..
Somewhere in the afternoon.
Quality and quantity...
Nah I'll give this a pass.
Used to patronize but i felt as they don't take their customers seriously..
Well all the best then."
Fried and grilled food
Very slow service...too many online orders n staff tend to caters to d online orders more en us who waited to dine at the coffee shop...very disappointed
Power. Must try
Western food. Very tasty and affordable. Can order delivery via Foodpanda.
fast preparation of food
Really good western food at a very affordable price. At peak timings however the wait times can be extremely long. Expect to wait more than 10-20 minutes at times. I'll definitely be back again!
Slow as usual. Dirty coffeeshop
Really long waiting time. So so food....
"Good food, reasonable pricing, good parking space, POSB ATM beside the coffeeshop,"
Slow..... It took me 35min to have my food served. Due to food panda packing. I was not informed when ordering my food
Delicious and value for money western food!
"Dirt cheap, affordable grub food! For a kopitiam shop I'd say the food's not too shabby! Will definitely come back. And no ridiculous waiting time for me and fam. Food came within 25mins which i think is reasonable as they prepared it then and there. Cannot brain ppl who complained so much! Go cook yourself then:)"
Good food generous portion thumbs up 
Long waiting time
Food always cold.  Not freshly cook
Waited 20 min for the food. Lotsa angry waiting customers. Cajun chicken was burnt. Not sure what is cajun about it cause it tasted like normal chicken chop. Sauce was salty. Fries was ok. Bread was gd. I rather eat the rojak at the Indian stall next time. The only star it gets is for the bread. N no. It's not cheap. Definitely not hawker center price
long queuing time
It's cheap. Accessible via mrt. Taste is ok can be better.
Cajun chicken tasted burnt even when I ate it right after it was served. Fairly disappointed.
Try the popcorn chicken with cheese worth it. Cajun fries are not that good
Opens at 1130am and not 11am. About 40 mins waiting time after ordering. What stood out the most for me were the fries. Reasonable price for the portion. Would definitely come back to try more. Ordered a Black Pepper Chicken for $7.20.
"Waiting time was abt 1hour on 29 May 2018.
Long queue, queued about 10-20mins.
Food wasnt up to my standard.
I mean if your made to wait for 1 hour for your food to come, you would expect something really nice and thus, worth the wait right?
Was rather diasppointed.
Would not go again.
(Fried rice was tasteless)
Average western food."
Super fast service as I got my packed chicken cutlet under 5mins. Taste decent and yummy. Satisfied my meat cravings today. Thanks!
The food was really bad and the service was terrible. Definitely won't be back
"The Google opening hours says it close at 9:30pm, but for the past 20 times when I tried to visit at 8:30pm in the past 1 year, they 100% of the time always say closed and sold out, by 8:15pm or 8:30pm, I stays nearby... (I emphasise strongly on the words 100% of the time)

Please amend your opening hours to until 8:30pm if you intend to serve until then, instead of posting FAKE opening hours."
All time favourite Fish and Chip. I have been eating this Fish and Chip for over 20 years. Their portion are huge. Do have patience if there's crowd. Its worth the wait. 
"firstly, i love the fish and chips, its kind of like an old school taste. the beef is also pretty juicy and affordable. the atmosphere is homely and taste authentic"
"Thursday 12+pm lunch 0 custormers, yet don't even sell chicken wing.
Why is the shop even open? Then what do you sell? Close shop for good better.

Really miss the good old days ran by the original owners, nice old couple. These youngsters really destroying their legacy and business."
"Limited variety, and taste is just average at best.
The only convenience is that they are the only western food stall near that area, which I guess also gives them the incentive to do whatever they want in terms of food quality, price point etc.

Alot of other western food stalls now offer significantly larger and attractive varieties (I place strong emphasise on the word ""significantly"" compared to this stall''s varieties offered, at similar price points too)."
"Horrible service from the 2 guys at the stall. I asked for more mayonnaise as they're always very stingy with it. I saw the 1st guy took my takeaway packet to the 2nd guy and asked for the mayonnaise bucket. He then scooped another spoonful and threw it in my beans (see picture). THEY THEN GIGGLED AND LAUGHED TO EACH OTHER. Very unpleasant experience. If you want to be mocked at, feel free to order from them."
Love the fish and chip.
"If you are coming to this coffeeshop, this is the only store that is worth it, the other stores ain't worth it, stingy, overpriced, it is just plain ridiculous, I would recommend you head over to the other coffeeshop or the market"
Love the chicken chop and fried chicken wings - very well marinated. My to-go stall when craving strikes. Staff is friendly and nice.
"Old school fish and chips, served by a friendly boss and straight to my table"
Old school western. No complains and affordable. Steak was well cooked. I enjoyed it!
"My favourite Western hawker steak in all of the places I've tried around Singapore, beats Uno Beef too. Very succulent steak, affordable and very good portion of food steak and sides, very nostalgic brown gravy sauce. I no longer live in the area but everytime I crave steak I get a craving for this place"
Have been eating from this western stall for more than 20 years since before the original uncle step down due to health issues. I get that they are trying their best to maintain the standards but the portion of the sides are a little disappointing nowadays.
"When Swensons first opened in Changi Airport in the early eighties, I got a chance to eat the best fish and chips.  Lo and behold, one day during the pandemic, I chanced upon it again, right in my neighbourhood.  It's the breaded type, crispy on the outside and soft in the inside.  Generous portion with tartar sauce, coleslaw, baked beans and French fries.

These days, whenever we feel like having a hefty meal, I will pop by and pack home fish and chips, chicken cutlet or chicken chop and finally tried the steak.  Everything priced affordably.  I see young parents bringing their kids for chicken wing and French fries treat mid afternoon.  Reminded me of when fish and chips was a treat for passing exams or doing well.  This place is really comfort food.  Service is extremely polite, fast and friendly.  Pack home also no extra charge.  Highly recommended!"
Not bad food just nice. Service ok .place ok
Randomly choose a western food place in the area. Never expect a decent meal from them. Steak was well cooked really fast in the cooking to table timing. Was not pack due to the outlook. But i quite a decent nostalgic western food place to choose and very reasonable price range. Quite impress for the amount i paid. Good job 
love their wings!! steak is value for money !
Really a hidden gem! Yummy western food and friendly staff.
"Really awesome fish & chips, better than most other Western food stalls. Staff were friendly as well"
"Staff very polite and well mannered . Fish & Chip really very nice , highly recommended !"
Great tasting western food at really good prices as well. My family loves the beef steak ... which is top notch and super value. Kudos to the team at this stall!
"Everything here is good, chicken chop, beef steak, fish and chips, lamb chops, chicken wings etc.... I live for their chicken wings and brown sauce. They go so well together!"
Delicious spring chicken
"My son loves their western food, tasty and affordable!"
"I live near and whenever I crave western food I will go and buy it a decent price for good western food.
Recommend"
Decent heartland affordable western grubs :)
chicken rice is ok..
Used to be nice. Now rice has no fragrance anymore.
"Update 27/2
$4 chicken is miserable. Add $2 for extra chicken also still as bad. Lost faith in this stall. Now paid $7 still not full. This stall is greedy imo.

Rather eat prawn noodles from block 302 s11 kopitiam."
Inside my top 5 in sg
Fantastic chicken rice
"$4 for this, chicken is thinly sliced. Not much meat."
Perfect example of shrinklation in a chicken rice. Rice and chicken portion is so small akin to kids meal that I have to order 2 plates to only fill 3/4 full. Price has also gone up. Add rice $1 for a small portion and in a coffee shop setting is crazy high.
"If I could give a 0 star, I would. Service attitude SUCKS, especially this auntie from the store  she's always the one serving the rice, taking orders, etc. Asked for Azhar and even offered to pay more, she brushed us off and said ""dont even have already, how to give???"". asked for less rice and she also didn't respond to it. Afterwards. I saw the customers after us getting Azhar, went back to ask her and she replied rudely ""just now don't have, just took out from the fridge"".

if a customer comes back to ask you for it, and you CLEARLY have them, won't you give it????? seriously it's not like you're out of it... been a few times and she's always like that..."
Woodlands Singapore Neighborhood Chicken Rice Stall.
The chicken rice had a fragrance smell and soft in taste. I will go back to eat again
Tender and juicy chicken with fragrant rice and adequately spicy chili. Simple yet delicious.
"Their chicken rice is $4, I asked for a bigger plate & the uncle said $6. OMG! Look at the portion, this is $6!!!???? It's like I hv eaten half! Imagine their portion for $4??? When I clarified with the uncle, he said its ""added"" portion! Im speechless! U hv just lost a customer!"
"Chicken is tender and nice. Rice is fragrant. Service is fast. Can see long queues mostly during the day, especially during meal times. My go-to chicken rice in the woodlands/marsiling area."
The chicken rice is no longer worth it for $5.30--such a small portion. I also just realized they changed the name to Feng Feng instead of Feng Ji. It's not as tasty as before...won't go back again rather go Beach Road way better!!!
Chicken getting smaller and smaller. Like the steamed chicken but portion is small. Very thirsty after eating it. Rice is fragrant and nice but wish it is hotter.
What happen? Use to be good.
Best steamed chicken rice
4 dollars for this. The chicken is way too little. This not seafood just chicken. Rice bland.
"In my view, the best roast chicken rice in Singapore. Amazing tasting chicken roasted or done to perfection. The rice is prefect and add with tasty acha veggies. Amazing meal. Highly recommended."
Probably the best chicken rice in sg!
The rice and chilli taste bland.
The chicken rice damn good...love it...
"Food is good but the service attitute is so poor, especially there is one thin n tall guy attitute so bad, can't even ask more when you are not clear about the price, show u the tone, and when u ask him what is his problem, he said his tone was like that...suck..

"If you live in Woodlands, this is the best chicken rice store you can find. I arrived at 11am and there wasn't many people queuing. The white chicken rice that I ordered is priced decently $4. The white chicken was tender, and the sauce that comes absolutely complements and spices up the chicken. To summarise, if you reside in woodlands, consider trying this store, but if you stay outside of woodlands, there are definitely better chicken rice options such as 928 Yishun Central chicken rice."
"Grew up eating this stall
My favourite chicken rice in Singapore, definitely the best"
"Not bad...if hungry and are prepared to queue during weekday lunch period.

Rice was well cooked (slightly on the softer side as I personally do not quite like 'al dente' rice).

Chili was nice, being on the slightly sweet side, with hints of garlic and calamansi and a pleasant level of heat that doesn't blow your head off.

Ordered roasted chicken breast and the portion was decent (despite what I have read on other reviews).

Tiny gripe was that the gizzard was a little tough for me with the connecting white tendon parts being very very tough and couldn't get through.

Located within the S11 coffee shop at Blk 304 Woodlands.

They've been around for a while with another stall in Tampines I gather.

Can eat, won't be bad...but I won't drive down just to eat there."
"If you are around Woodlands, you definitely know this stall, which serves 1 of the cheapest chicken rice in SG before Covid days.

Now, at $4 per plate for normal chicken rice, I think it is still reasonable with some achar and a bowl of soup. Just be ready to queue during meal times, especially lunchtime. My favourite is the white chicken breast meat rice.

If you can't find it, it is likely the only stall with a queue is the only clue I can give.

As they always give very little black sauce and chilli, you do need to help yourself to them while you wait for your order.

Also, if you do a takeaway, they will normally not give you the achar, worried that you do not eat them immediately, causing it to go bad..so they have their reputation in mind. So if you want the pickled vege, remember to tell them and eat them soon after you get home."
"Been a frequent customer of this store since young and food is great but so annoyed with the attitude of the rude short uncle that mans the store. Frequently shouts orders in your face, and with $0.80 addition of rice, shakes things off. Really pathetic small packet hardly full. Other uncle / aunty manning the store is ok but this uncle creating so much stress making it hard to enjoy a good meal."
"Grew up here so I'm a long time buyer of the chicken rice. It's really disappointing how you pay $0.80 for Jia Fan but the portion they give you is pathetic. Whenever you takeaway, they try to short change you by not giving you acar. You're running a business and there's always a long queue do you need to shortchange your customers like that? I'm ok for paying $0.80 for Jia Fan but come on la portion still so little? I eat at other Chicken rice stall don't need add rice also full, this is only stall I add rice still feel not enough. Especially the short uncle scooping rice, every time will shake the bowl until 3/4 bowl then add for us? Please buck up if not you will lose many of your loyal customers."
"Portion size too small, not worth. Your money better spent elsewhere."
$4 chicken rice. Unprepared for a small portion of chicken.
"Popular chicken rice stall !
A very polite uncle manning the counter, a plus point indeed !
My favorite is the roasted chicken rice !"
"Asked for $4 chicken rice and extra rice.Charged $5.80.Asked why?Seller said that he add meat extra,actually he made plate bigger and given normal amount of meat.Day time robbery stall!"
"Ordered 1/2 chicken for $14 but the portion looks like 1/4 only.
The chicken and chili tasted normal not very fantastic. The rice and the soup were tasteless.
I will not go back to them again."
"Won't come again! Pay for 2 pax price but chicken meat is only like 12 small pcs which they smack till very flat.
All what I see is chicken skin.
They put alot of cucumbers below to lift up the chicken and alot of coriander to cover the chicken. When I push aside all the coriander, then I saw the chicken potion.."
"Used to dine here often since I stay nearby.
Food is always great but the service by that new c lady is really bad. I have to repeat my order and she seems to just assume all the customers want roasted chicken rice. I ordered $4 chicken feet but she said it was $3.
The service used to be great by old staff, helping each other along but this lady seems to take all the power and had a super unhappy meal.
Please tell her to work on her service attitude if u don't want to lose more customers"
Rice wasn't oily and white chicken was tender. Chili has quite a kick to it. Delicious meal overall!
Told the auntie Da Pan with extra rice which the stall plate indicates as 5 dollars but she proceeded to charge me 6.80 for it with no extra rice and the chicken portion is not even equivalent of 6 dollars!
One of my favourite chicken rice
"One of the worst chicken rice stall I have ever visited in terms of attitude. They did not allow choosing of parts as they have alot of left over breast meat n insist me to take it or leave it.

Attitude is getting worse, pay them money is like I owe them $.

The only saving grace is tat their chicken rice is more tasty then what is offered arnd the vicinity."
Very good Chicken Rice
"If you enjoy Yishun 925 chicken rice, you will like Feng Feng chicken rice at Marsiling. Very similar in taste, debone, tender."
" Takeaway portion and quality was as good as dine in.
 Chicken was juicy, tender and delicious.
 Rice were fragrant and not greasy!"
"Long queue but there's a reason. It's cheap and good! $3/4 for nice chicken rice, much nicer than the <insert famous chicken rice here>"
Best chicken rice in SG. Cheap & tasty.
Popular but not that impressive. Quite ordinary but the queue is long during lunch time.
Reached 737pm and it's closed
"Good chicken rice in sauces, serve with cucumber and achar as sides"
"Decent plate of chicken rice but nothing to shout about. Rice is ok tasty, steamed chicken is quite rubbery and on the dry side.

Still think the rice and chicken at yishun 925 is better."
Best cheap chicken rice stall i have ever eaten at. Been a loyal customer for like 10years. Highly recommended
"Feng Feng has the best roasted chicken rice! Although roasted, the meat is succulent with chicken skin in tact with almost all pieces. Even the chicken breast is tender and juicy, something most other vendors cannot achieve.

The rice is fragrant and packed with flavour. Chilli is spicy and intense. Chicken rice is a popular local dish in Singapore but Feng Feng has brought finesse to the highest levels.

The roasted version is so good that I've never tried the steamed version, although my family member said it's very soft and tender! In my opinion, this stall has the best chicken rice in the country! These guys cook from the heart!!"
"This is the go to chicken rice hawker in the Woodlands. Solid, consistent, quality."
"Can't fault this place, pretty good chicken rice. I wished I had ordered more rice.

Very very decent chicken rice and above average for sure. Definitely better than a lot of places"
Nice chicken rice in marsiling
"Sorry but the fishball noodles is super bad, not cooked! fishy smell!
what's the need for the price hike!!!???

There isn't any mask wearing needed for the stallkeepers???

where is the hygiene!!!"
"Ordered white chicken drumstick plus gizzard. Cost $6.20.

Pro
Chicken. Tender and savory with all the ma you and chicken rice. Add those gravy to rice for better enjoyment.

Rice. Reasonably good can be a bit soggy but largely good.

Meh
Soup. Another msg plus water.

Cons
The chili sauce given was too little that day"
Chicken rice is nice!
One of the best. Period.
"Their chicken rice is really nice, perfect with chilli sauce."
Best chicken rice in the area!
"Chicken Rice is Nice... BUT... their staff service is unfriendly... I Was Q up and wan to buy Steam chick rice with Thigh meat, uncle reply NO more... So I ask how about chick drumstick? (which is I saw it have ) uncle reply to me ... You don understand Chinese ah ? I already say Don Have !!

I was thinking why this uncle need to be so rude ? I hear my friends say... this short and fat uncle always very rude to customers for a long time ago until now... but the owner boss stall seem like did nothing to the staff..."
"Ordered the roasted chicken rice to go and the person didn't even ask if I want $3 or $4. Just assume and packed the $4 one. Added rice and it was $4.7. The portion size was still the same as without adding rice. The meat was dry and tasteless, didn't even come with cucumber. The chilli was watery and diluted. Not how I remember it to be. Expensive and doesn't taste good. Very disappointing and will definitely not buy from here again."
"Food is nice comparing those around the area.  Just that there's an old man who's Manning the order will ""throw"" your food at you. If you want normal service, this is definitely a no go."
Best of Best Hainanese Chicken Rice in the North 
"One of my favourite chicken rice stall in Marsiling. Tender and the rice tasted so yummy.
Highly recommended."
"Roast Chicken Rice with Chicken Feet. Worried about the lack of fresh chicken due to the export ban impose by Malaysia. I knew I have to go eat my chicken rice before June comes. Hearsay this chicken rice stall is comparable to my favourite Katong Boneless Chicken Rice so I had to investigate. Missed out on their white chicken (sold out!) but turns out their roast chicken is actually pretty good. Are they a real threat?  Nah... but they can definitely pull their weight in Woodlands.

Nov 2022

Roast Chicken Rice. Probably Woodlands best chicken rice. The roast chicken is one of the best I have eaten in the northern part of Singapore. The skin just slides off the meat like a steam chicken would."
"Best neighbour chicken rice in woodlands, cheap and food is consistently good. Chicken is soft and love the chilli"
Nice chicken rice with a queue always
The uncle who took the orders was super rude.
"Fan Li Li Fen Ming,Bu You Ni,Guang Gu De Hao Duo Nian,

Really a good chicken rice. Its a must try. Better than many big names in Singapore
Long time ago is at yishun block 925.lost and founded back good memories and great taste.if a chicken rice stall .must try their chicken breast part.. is soft tender and juicy...you should know what their standard in taste and preparing...pls prepare for long queue for peak hours visit.
"After the war inflation coupled with the decreased chicken inflation, this stall is still selling at pre-inflation price. Half a chicken is $13. One whole chicken $26. Fresh chicken and not a small size one either. The chicken rice is not very salty but yet fragrant. Absolutely must come and eat."
"I had the steamed chicken rice.

The chicken was nice and tender and the chilli was also good.

The rice could have had more flavour, but nonetheless the entire meal was great."
"Was craving for some steam chicken so bought the whole chicken for takeaway. Saw the person cut away some meat to stash aside. (I heard this is a common practice for chicken rice stall, no wonder my father in law always watch them cut the whole chicken.) The steam chicken still a bit red around the bone area, not fully cook. Taste wise okay. Sauce ok. The cucumber achar is nice."
"23Sep22 - I've to drop my 5 stars review to 3 stars, reasons are
1. Portion of chicken meat has greatly reduced.
2. Inconsistent charging.

July22 - This stall has been here for many years since I stayed in Woodlands region. IMHO, the chicken meats are even better than the famous S'pore big brand."
I buy chicken  rice for my lunch. It's so delicious..
Always long queue and sold out very early. Taste is good. Wife love the chicken feet. Worth it
Very rude staff. If not happy pls don't work. Don't show attitude to customers.
Generally OK as it has been there for years and have its group of loyal consumer. However if may be a little drop in standard as compared to those who have tried them years before. Can compared with 925 as they were slightly similar in taste but they offer roasted options.
Nice chicken rice in the north
Bad attitude
"Went to try out myself after recommended by my friend. Got myself $4 roasted chicken rice. Nothing special. The rice was dry, roasted chicken skin was soggy. I'll give good rating for the soup and extra effort of the acar. That's all."
Very tasty! Good price and friendly service!
"I'm a Woodlands resident and have been patronising this stall for the last 20+ years. It had always been a value for money, and delicious. Lately the quality has dropped IMHO. Still decent but noticed that the soya sauce gravy has lost some dimension. It's now just plain salty. Gone are the slight umami sweetness. Chilli has gone downhill. No kick at all. Not spicy or limey enough. In short the balance if way off. Not sure if it's the effect of C19, which tends to get everyone down and dispirited. But will stop eating this for a while."
"Poor poor attitude by cashier.
Standards dropped a lot. Very plain chicken rice. Don't even have braised egg. Price not worth."
Very delicious chicken rice. Highly recommended.
"Visited on during 1st Day Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) to takeaway since dine in not allowed.

Went around 1130am (was a Sunday morning) and waited like 20 minutes. It was used to be quite quick despite the queue. However today felt the pace were slowed to create queue.

Ordered $4 roasted chicken and as you may see on picture, the chicken skin is very little. Chicken texture were tougher side, however the rice is fragrance for sure.

Fun fact: order a $3 and you might notice little to no difference compared to $4 portion."
Best chicken rice in the north area. The uncle who took order always fast and efficient. I here for my $3 rice so I won't expect much of customer service. Order eat and go.
Good chicken rice with the worst service. Man in charge of cashiering is super rude.
Perhaps the best chicken rice stall in Singapore. Hands down better than Tian Tian in Maxwell's.
"The chicken rice is SUPER DUPER nice. Seriously, I would eat 10 plates of rice at this place. I'd just keep ordering and ordering and ordering. AMAZING!"
Comfort food... 
"Hao Chi,Bu Guo Zhen Yao Shuo Qi Lai,Yao Te Di Pao Yi Tang De Hua,Wo Dao Shi Jue De Bu Bi. 

Fu Zeng De Feng Li Pao Cai Hen Te Bie,Zhu Zai Fu Jin De Hua Hen Jian Yi Qu Chi Kan Kan. "
Great chicken rice for the price. 1 whole chicken for $25. Each plate of rice at $0.50.  Quality and taste is comparable to 925 Yishun Chicken Rice.
The two old man at the stall is so rude and arrogant ..u will never get wat u want to order .they will say no more or cannot sell ..but u can see they keep the chicken at the back of stalls .very unhonest ppl .even is food is not bad .but will never go back again .
One of the best chicken rice in Woodlands. My family likes their soft and fluffy rice. Their chilli is very aromatic and lends a mild spice with the taste of calamansi lime. I enjoy their white chicken which is juicy. Their roast chicken is also flavourful. Just order both if you cannot decide which type of chicken you want.
Price is very affordable and chicken rice is super nice.
"Paid $50.20 for one and a half white chicken, a box of chicken gizzards ($4), a box of chicken feet ($4), a chicken liver and 5 packets of rice. The rice was fragrant and the chicken meat, except the breast portions, was tender and smooth. Service was friendly as the uncle packed the achar, cucumber and sauce separately."
"Slow service. Even though only does takeaway and being aware of the covid19  situation, I guess the 4 employees (wait they have 4 employees!) took their own time to prepare the orders. Esp the person on the chop board. Slow and really steady. No sense of urgency as well. Safe distancing not practice in front of store obviously. Chicken is also not tasty. No cucumbers as well.Disappointed and Regretted queueing and wasted my time."
"It comes with roasted and steam chicken. I personally prefer the steam chicken. The meat is succulent, soft and moist with it's flavourful juices. The chilli sauce is amazingly good. Love the acar that comes with it. Only gist is the soup. It's just plain, could have added more ingredients in it. But, overall, it's a good place to fix your chicken rice craving..."
"The rice here used to be more fragrant.  Chicken is still very good, tender and flavourful and mix well with the black soya sauce and chilli sauce provided.  One of the better chicken rice in the North."
good chicken
"Lived in Singapore for 4 years, left 7 years ago but still make a pilgrimage to this chicken rice shop every time I come back to visit Singapore. It's that good."
"For the price of view, it's quite valued for the money. My plate is only 3 SGD. the pickle in the plate is quite good. Chicken and rice are ok."
One hidden gem in Woodlands. Expect a queue during meal times though it moves along pretty quickly. Both the steamed and roasted chickens are good and the rice is flavorsome.
"Best chicken rice here with roasted or white version only! Maybe that's why they are able to perfect the dish! Just imagine that u need to queue for about 25 mins during lunch time!
I can even see some students from American School ordering 2 plates per person!
Currently selling $3 for a plate which comes with archar and a bowl of soup. Best served with some dark soya sauce on rice & chilli sauce on chicken!"
The chicken and the chilli taste good. The fact that it can open 3 branches speaks much for itself.
"Nice chicken rice visit by many people, always a queue there"
"Always long queue for the chicken rice. It's nice, 1st time trying it. Forget about the western food stall though, food is average and sides are small in portion."
"23/07/2019.

Finally tried this chicken rice today (always came here for Noelle's Signature). Ordered a pack of chicken wing rice for $3.50 - price is reasonable. The chilli sauce is very nice, good to go w the rice and the chicken.

But the rice itself is just very average, not fragrant or flavorful enough. Chicken wing meat is a little on the tough side. Both has to go with the chilli (or the soy sauce) in order to taste gd. Serving is on the larger portion though. For the price paid, it is considered not bad.

Overall, 5/10 for rice, chicken 5/10, chilli sauce 7/10 for our taste buds."
"Been here many times in the last 3 years, quality has been consistently good. If you want a good plate of chicken rice (get the white!) in the North, this place has to be on your list."
"Delicious chicken rice, portion is good also"
Hard to find a better tasting steam chicken rice for the price. The rice is simply screaming chicken rice and the steam chicken is perfection. Looking for chicken rice in woodlands? Look no further.
Delicious tender and tasty chicken
"Ji Fan Hao Chi,Wei Dao Bu Cuo,Jie Qian Gong Dao,Zhi Shi Yong Can Di Fang You Dian Re"
"Regular for over 15+ years (Before even the coffee shop was renovated twice).

The quality of the chicken rice has dropped over the last few years ever since they have hired some new staff recently to help them with the cooking. Rice is very fragrant, no doubt about it. However, the soup is way too salty sadly. Texture of the chicken is inconsistent at times, only reason why it taste good it's because of the sauce they pour over the chicken.

As for their crystal chicken feet, it's like eating a nugget without the batter. It's tasteless by itself, and you will only taste the sauce. So, it is best not to order it.

If you want better chicken rice options, this is not the store you are looking for. This store is way too overrated. The only good thing over here is the sauce they use to pour over the chicken and that's it."
One of the better chicken in woodlands area
"Tourist, if you want to enjoy 5 star hotel qualify chicken rice but hawker center price, this is the one!"
"Cheap and good.  Rice is fragrant and chicken(white) is succulent.  Service fast.  Except they do not have grated ginger. Ordered drumstick w rice $4, n gizzards at $3small."
"Xi Huan Zao Shang Lai Chi Zhe Li De Chao Mi Fen(Jia Pei Liao)He Yi Wan Re Gun Gun De Zhu Rou Zhou. Bu Tong Dang Wei,Shui Zhun Shi 8/10."
"One of the only places in North part of Singapore that serves delicious chicken rice. What makes it great for me is its fragrant rice, tender chicken and spicy chili. Yes, in case you are wondering, their chilli packs a punch, legit! Two thumbs up!

#localguides"
The rice is sooo aromatic and well formed.But top quality chicken need to have a layer of jelly below the skin and the flesh is juicy not pulpy.
Terrible attitude towards customers. Was scolded for ordering white chicken just because they have sold out. What? My fault? Changed to roasted instead. Sat beside the store and saw other customers getting the same treatment too. Do not patron.
"a regular here. Standards never drop from my past experience. however, the crowd has make them increase their prices (given their rural location)"
"Pretty long queue but very fast! Personally I felt that only the chilli is quite nice. The rice isn't very flavourful, the chicken was on the tough side. I think I have tasted better and cheaper chicken rice!"
Chicken is succulent
"Ping Min Mei Shi,Shui Du Xiao Fei De Qi!"
4 dollars serving quite small. Long queue during lunch. Too little skin for roasted chicken. Rice is fragrant. Near marsling mrt walkable via shelter

"Chicken Rice is nice but I am not sure if it is the best.

Noticed someone mention about the noise. Yes the uncle is annoyingly loud. I get frustrated each time I have my meal here."
"Good Chicken Rice, RUDE shouting uncle taking the order. Rice serving is also too little."
"Good: Chicken rice tastes good.
Bad:
- Uncle shouts orders too loudly it stresses people within the coffee shop
- The rice serving is tooooo little. The uncle shakes the bowl he uses to scoop the rice too much a huge part of the ""bowl of rice"" that lands on the plate is actually air. not good."
How come half a chicken doesn't come with drumstick?
"Best chicken Rice in Singapore.

Better than Tian Tian (Maxwell)"
White chicken and the intestines are good :)
One of the best chicken rice in Singapore! Great taste and very nice and friendly people.
One of the better chicken rice in yishun/sembawang/woodlands. This is a $4 portion. The chicken is really good. Tender and fragrant. The rice is cooked right though could be a bit more fragrant. Chili is great too. The soup is ok. Would definitely come back.
Easily my favorite Chicken Rice in Woodlands. The sauce and rice makes the dish. It's roast chicken over steam for me at this stall. Expect long queues during lunch and dinner hours.
Very nice chicken rice
"Eating this chicken rice store for 22 years. Still long queue, provides the best food around here and price is reasonable."
One of nice chicken rice in woodland
Chicken and rice are yummy!
Loved the chicken rice here
"i know this chicken rice owner, he owned 3 freehold shophouses at River Valley."
Cheap good chicken rice
Really nice chicken rice.
Chicken rice wasn't too bad. May be better than Loy Kee down the road.
Very delicious Chicken rice with reasonable price. It has been here since 1990
Best chicken rice in woodlands
Don't be put off by the queue! It moves rather quickly and the meat is super tender! Just remember to upsize it because the serving is rather small.
"Had both the roasted and steamed chicken, and loved both versions! The meat of both types were really really tender and not in the least bit dry. Chicken came served with homemade achar (preserved vegetables) and soup, making it a very wholesome meal. Rice was really fragrant too, but found it abit too soft."
Extra bowl need to pay 10cents?? I will not buy from such stall
Xlb and Shanghai fried dumplings were ok.
Been coming here for a long time! Cheong fun here is super good! They make the Chee Cheong Fun themselves!
I'm a fan of this DimSum shop . Love their food very much and friendly customer service. Affordable and quality is superb .
"Like other reviews have mentioned, the dim sum here is surprisingly good. We particularly enjoyed the steamed shrimp dumplings, which had a translucent skin and a filling of fresh shrimps. The crispy deep-fried shrimp rolls were crunchy with a generous filling of shrimp and fish paste, while the fresh shrimp chee cheong fun had a smooth texture with fresh shrimps inside. The steamed pork ribs with rice were tender and flavourful. Overall, a great spot for quality dim sum."
"Unexpectedly delicious!

Chanced upon this little unimposing dim sum stall, Feng Xin Dim Sum, during an afternoon pit stop. Despite a more established and popular dim sum stall located nearby, I chose to give the lesser known FXDS a shot.

FXDS doesn't have a long menu, only 20 dim sum dishes. I waited no further to place my order - Steamed Shrimp Dumpling (Har Gau) and Xiao Long Bao - the epitome of dim sum. On a weekend, under 20-minute wait for these freshly-made morsels (3 pcs in each bamboo steaming basket) to be served piping hot is totally acceptable.

The Har Gau is amazingly superb! Can taste the freshness and natural sweet flavor of plump succulent shrimps with every bite. Dumplin skin is perfectly thin and translucent, yet doesn't tear easily even when picking up with chopsticks.

The hand-folded XLB tastes glorious too, contrary to some reviews! The balance of paper thin skin and flavorful meaty filling (thankfully no gamey pork!) in clear broth makes each bite a burst of savoury goodness. Make sure to nibble, watch the soup flow, add Chinese vinegar & shredded ginger as deemed fit, slurp and lap up!

Pleasantly surprised by the high food quality here..can tell the male boss makes the dim sum fresh and with heart while lady boss is very welcoming and attentive. Prices are reasonably wallet-friendly too. However I'd prefer a slightly more intense sambal/chilli oil-based version for dipping rather than the current sweet chilli sauce.

Not confined to breakfast time, these bite-sized pieces of satisfaction are fuss-free snack or meal anytime of the day! Overall recommended for a unique dim sum experience (in a food center)! If in the Marine Parade vicinity again, I won't hesitate to repeat visit to FXDS and try its other dim sum items."
Dim Sum with Mummy  - 8/1/2025
"Although the range was not extensive, the dim sum was high quality and well made. Good value and very delicious. Am always a bit skeptical of dim sum in food centers but this was as good or even better than what you would fine in the pricier dim sum establishments. The shrimp roll and carrot cake were fried to perfection. Not oily and full of flavor. The char siew bau was light and tasty. Will definitely be returning to try the other dishes."
"Dim Sum are freshly steamed hot serve on table. Taste authentic to HK dim sum, but the cheung fan and the skin can be thinner.
Overall I recommend and give 5  for this!"
"Ordered siew mai and glutinous rice, siew mai was ok but the rice not so nice."
"It was located inside a hawker centre. The dim sum was reasonably priced with decent portions. The fried carrot cake was crispy on the outside while soft and warm on the inside, perfection!"
Their food is not fresh
Love them. They r yummy.
"Ordered the usual dim sum items. The char Siew bao was fluffy, Siew Mai was quite small. Pork ribs was delicious and the chee cheong fun was average at best. A decent dim sum place"
Brought 2 sets of har gao. Gotten food poisoning and diarrhea. End up seeing a doctor.
"Incredibly friendly owners. Fresh, delicious, affordable food made from the heart.

So rare to find a dim sum stall that still makes stuff from scratch -- a real gem in the hood! Highly recommend giving them a go 

We LOVED the spare ribs steamed rice. Piping hot & incredibly comforting "
So far this is one of the best stalls at this market!
"Food is ok, dont try the xiao long bao. There is a weird taste, seems like the meat they are using is not fresh."
"Tried the siew mai, har gar and porridge. Porridge is gd. Siew Mai and har gar, not nice. Skin too thick and the ingredients don't taste good."
Their tim sum tastes good but not too oily and salty. The fried dumpling skin is crispy and the meat is delicious. The prawn chee cheong fun is also soft and when u put into your mouth u will have a satisfied feeling :)
Need improvements in the quality of Har kao and siew mai not worth it
"My go to dim sum place on the weekends. Fave is the pork ribs! Well seasoned with a lil kick from the chilies, not all bone. Love the chee cheong fun sauce there too. The liushabao is good enough for hawker centre quality and the price I pay. xiao long bao is okay only but it's honestly hard to find nice ones these days."
"Nice dim sums at this stall, just few metres away from the famous Neptune dim sum stall.

Since there was a long queue at Neptune, decided to try this one. Friendly stall owner.

Ordered siew mai and steamed shrimp dumplings. Liked the texture of the dumplings, was tasty and hot.

However, two minor complaints - the dumplings were stuck to each other (like store-bought dumplings) and there was no side of chilli at the stall (only ketchup)."
"Like the Neptune dim sum stall further down the line, they served good dim sums. Owner friendly and attentive to our order. Dim sum were of good quality and good taste."
"Pure food, clean tastes, delicious!"
Dim sum is nice at an affordable price.
"This is a newer dim sum stall in the food center, besides the other one that has been here for a long time and is a popular stall with queue.

It was Sunday and we came by here for our teabreak after doing our weekly grocery shopping. We thought of giving it a try (as in the past we have been patronizing the other stall). It was not crowded as it was 3.30pm then.

We ordered the chee cheong fun with charsiew and fu pi juan (fish paste wrapped with beancurb skin). Generally, the foods were nice, smooth and the sauce was appetising though a little salty for me. The items were hot, which was a must for dim sum.

The price was within the same range as the other stall. With this stall, it provides an alternative to the other, similar quality and price and you need not wait so long.

Do give it a try next time!"
"Update- still as great
Love this place. Fresh made dim sum. Porridge and Chee Cheong as the base. Add braised pork ribs  chicken feet or Siew Mai as protein, crystal dumpling as vegetable and either spring roll or shrimp dumpling for deep fried crunchiness."
"So delicious, and a very nice stall owner. They open early enough so that I can have delicious breakfast before work, plus a Kopi from the next door stall."
Good variety of dim sum. Porridge is nice too! Hope to eat again next time!
"Ordered the century egg congee and XLB. Congee was very tasty and given the price, it's definitely a repeat order! XLB was alright. Look forward to trying other dishes."
"Porridge was crispy and light, Carrot Cake was likewise noice. The deep fried shrimp dumpling was nice and crispy with a good portion sizing. Overall, a v good place experience and the food used less salt too"
"Well priced and tasty!
Super friendly store owner too!"
"Best dim sum in all of SG!  Whenever we are visiting the east side, we make sure to pass by.  Prices are excellent for the tasty food that are offered. Definitely recommend!!"
Decadent bowl of porridge for only $2.70 and dim sum are mostly handmade like their siew mais. Definitely comparable to restaurant standards and aunty is super friendly and patient.
Nice Dim Sum
"18 Apr 2023: Dim sum at pocket friendly prices, friendly service and pretty wide choices available. Hakka Yong Tau Fu comes with nice gravy and Char Siew Bao is light and soft. Equally good too are the porridge, carrot cake, siew mai and har gao...will return for more yummy choices!"
"Decent dim sum in a hawker centre. Not cheap but tastewise, worth it.

Of the few items we tried, the hakka yong tau fu (basically stuffed dou fu) was very nice with the gravy. Siew mai is decent. The crispy deep fried shrimp roll on the other hand, had a odd shiny non-crispy texture to it.

Will be back to try other items.

Note: items offered are very similar to the stall further down the row which has been here for quite a while."
"My favourite dim sum stall at Marine Parade  
Good food and kind, friendly service "
"Good makan, reasonably priced!  Kids love it ;) impressive how they do several dim sum varieties with such a small stall."
"Har gao is good, char siew bao is not bad too. Overall for dim sum stall at the hawker centre, I would say the quality is high. ."
"friendly and attentive, and the dishes absolutely delicious. especially enjoyed the shrimp rolls"
Good !! The siew mai was good!
One of the best dimsum I have eaten! if I can give 10 stars out of 5 stars I would  Highly recommended to all the foodies out there!
Full of old school taste. Good!
No.1 dim sum
One of my favorite breakfast
fking good ah sia
my kids love it
"The uncle and auntie friendly, the dimsum are fresh and delicious, my personal favourite char siew pau"
All their steam items are great. I love them!!
"Feng Xin's lady proprietor is friendly and attentive, and male boss also very helpful."
Definitely go for the #1 Fresh Shrimps Chee Cheong Fun! I usually wrapped up the feeding session with Creamy Custard Buns. Hehe~ 
Fresh and tasty dim sum. The steamed prawn dumping is very good. And the stall helper here is much more friendly than the other one few stalls away. I prefer this stall.
Pretty good quality and reasonable price. Their steam rice also yummy.
"I had:
1. Siew mai - not bad
2. Steamed pork ribs - good
3. Chicken and century egg porridge - can be better

Food are not bad, but a slightly pricey. Can choose this for simple meal, and if you want food to be served fast as most dishes are ready."
"Some items quite pricey;
The char siew bao, looks big, but does not have that ""hmmmmmmm yummy"" impact."
CAN TRY place .. among the better
"I have a few favourites, fried prawn dumpling, siew Mai (siew Mai is one of the better ones compared to other places cos no gamey taste), Hakka tofu, carrot cake, Liu Sha Bao (really got liusha oozing out), pork ribs is a must try no joke! The taste is pretty good considering the pocket friendly price"
Branched out from Neptune Dim Sum situated a few stalls away. Quality and taste quite similar.
"Bought 2 ku chye kuehs and 3 soo  kuehs when I chanced upon this stall this morning.
The kueh is good and the skin is thin. The fillings are not as generous as another famous place but the price is lower too.
I would buy again if I pass through again."
The kuehs are steamed here and able to have them warm.  Skin is super thin and intricate. Very nice.  Please support.

"Soon kueh with freshly grated turnip and a hint of pepper.

Chive Ku Chye kueh were thin-skinned  as well. Good amount of chives.

Yam cake was too mushy for my liking.

They also offer glutinous rice, dumpling and steamed kuehs.

ordered nasi goreng ikan bilis combo they give me in the kind of small portion and i paid FOR $10?? if i knew they put inside here wont ever buy this combo from them. if the price was $8 still acceptable. but is for $10 really not worth it to put in this bento container? you guys should put inside a white container like how you used too and now the portion is very small. WILL BE MY LAST TIME PURCHASE NASI GORENG IKAN BILIS COMBO WITH YOU GUYS.

"NAME FIVE Star
When I go nothing to do ,still don't cook
Ppl rushing ,than I earlier 30min put order for pick up can go I ,until there no ppl cook ,until I ask them give a anger face ,is really terrible"
"I don't know why it's so hard for these people to read food orders! My order clearly indicated fish curry but what was delivered was mutton curry. This isn't the first time either. It creates   unnecessary frustration and anger! I will not recommend patronising this place! Not only is the cook inconsistent when it comes to the food cooked, mistakes in the delivery order often occur!"
One of the best Mee Kuah & Mee goreng served over here. Their yummy portion on plateful be sure to delight your appetite. Next door teh Tarik stall able to complete your great beverage to go along. Simply best ever comfort food served it here. They also have Indian rojak for you to choose from.
"Our go to place for prata, like they're both curry dhalcha and fish curry, must try with sambal. All the mee varieties are nice. Give a try to kothu prata you will like it."
"There is one of the chef, inside the kitchen named Sheik that does the best cooking and plus minus the team, they do a good job. Overall woodland's best mamak stall."
"Came at the stall at 6 plus,just ordered kway teow goreng chicken but stall keep on wants to give kway goreng teow beef in few minutes ready to eat, as i insisted to take kway teow goreng beef,than they started to cooked..the cooker can somemore shout, can't accepted that i insisted to take the kway teow.. we as a customer,you need to provide what customer wants, this is twice time,will never buy again,bad experience i had for dinner always"
"Order did not prepare as the way i wan, request for nasi goreng putih not spicy give me spicy and the nasi goreng is so dry to the point where we cannot even swallow please do something abt it"

2) Bee Hoon Goreng

it was pathetically tasteless to my horror
no vegetables
no beansprouts
no cracked stir fried egg invisible
below of any standards
mee Goreng beyond words
furthermore shortchanged of sliced cucumbers + Tomato sauce nowhere to be found for both items
I assumed it was packed together but to no avail
my final conclusion is only best not to purchase food products from this stall
disappointment awaits you for sure
its no longer
5  now
TOTAL RUBBISH 
The end for 2023 purchase
2024 onwards u won't see me no more definitely
wishing u all e best
get ready for the worst
ASSALAMUALAIKUM"
"Service's good, food prep is fast, and importantly the Nasi Goreng Ikan Bilis is fantastic, one of the best I tried so far "
So so but better than nothing after 22:00pm 
You sure this is five star. Most of its food aren't really fantastic. Not gonna lie. Western food there is just okay.
Very poorly not cooked tulang wasted my money
Spicy Mee Goreng
Portion of nasi goreng ikan bilis was big and it tastes spicy and delicious. Ordered roti prata as well. Overall was worth it and will order from here again.
"I Bought $10 Mutton steak. Came back home to find that idiot cheated me with minced meat. I don't find it as Mutton. So, disposed it. Please don't buy from this stall. I don't think they are halal respected shop."
"Great Food, Great people"
"Bro the tulang,really tulang .Where's abit of the meat sia and then the mutton chop the mutton my teeth can tercabut bro .What is this?"
Worst nasi goreng I've ever eaten easily looked nothing like the picture as well
Preparing food and serving customer not wearing mask
"Delicious, highly recommended"
The best Mee Goreng shop in the North. Very tasty and friendly staff.
Do not Grabfood from here. Do not order prata from here especially.
Delicious food
The mutton steak is really nice. So is the roti john combo.
"Very nice food. Sometimes during peak period , they tend to take a longer time to prepare. Nevertheless, they always no matter what attend to our special request.
Go n try their Prata Steak Roll, not bad tho."
"The food is lousy and the person who is preparing is very rude. He served me wrong order and refused to give me the correct order by saying that he is extremely busy.

I will not buy from any of the 3 food stores that are under one owner ever again.

Please do not buy food from them as both of the food and customer service are extremely lousy.

If I can give 0 star, I will give 0 star."
"Please refrain from buying Mee Goreng Seafood which costs 6 bucks. The worst mee goreng I ever tasted. Overburnt mee and eggs, only one sotong and a small prawn ( not exaggerating) and lots n lots n lots n lots of pepper. They could easily rename to Mee Goreng Black pepper. I am great fan of mee goreng but this one is way off from what you visualise."
Found sharp metal black nail in an order of Nasi Goreng Combo. Brother bit and nearly swallowed before spitting out.
Ordered Nasi Goreng Combo and found a sharp black metal nail inside which my brother bit and nearly swallowed. Scary.
Good Food and nice location to lepak with friends. Tried their Roti John Steak and it was wow.
Food there is awesome. The guys are trying their best to make us(customers) happy. Their RotiJohn Steak very sedap la. Keep it guys
Try their roti john steak. Worth it for the price. Good place to bring along your family and friends
"One of the best stalls in woodlands to dine in. Try their mee goreng combo, one of the best. Delicious, filling and satisfying"
So poor... Order different come different... 2x already.. Same mistake.. And price different frm menu online... More expensive
"The fried rice is full filled with wok hee and taste so good. Every weekend noon, the stall is full of food panda guys and let you wait ur dishes more than 20-30mins. Whole stall dishes are very nice but sinful. So weird no comment in google map review so far. So surprised I am the first to write the first review and picture."
Setving excellent steamed and roasted chicken rice. Charsiu is also marvelous
"Chicken rice is really good here!

The chicken is tender and juicy, and the rice is incredibly fragrant & full of flavor on its own.

A simple dish done really well. Worth a visit if you're craving classic chicken rice!"

"A good crowd during weekday lunch. Had to wait a while to get seats.

Nice spice to the chili sauce. A good chicken rice cannot do without a good sauce in my opinion. This one pass the test.
I also put out some of the heat with their homemade lemongrass drink which was very thirst quenching.

They have other cooked dishes besides chicken rice. We tried the salted egg pork, kailan and also hometown tofu. My favorite out of the 2 has to be the hometown tofu. Soft tofu that is slathered in a tasty sticky sauce with minced meat bits.

Air-conditioned dining area made it very comfortable to dine during the mid day heat."
"From a local perspective, it's the worst local chicken rice in town that's also over priced.
Food court at $5 version is even better than this at @$9.
Chicken and rice are dried.
It's far over priced with no quality and service.
Service staff attitude is below average.
Seems like I'm not the only patron being charged for a towel that was not even given on the table.
Make sure you check your bill before you pay.
I could not even be bothered to take a pic or stay longer than I just eat and go. Never will I return!"
"My second chance visiting the place and again experiencing is not good in terms of chicken quality and service this shop has. Was billed including towers which never had given. We checked but still have the feeling of being cheated.  Please have a good day but sorry, Not recommended.... I can cook better "
Came here due to long queue at other restaurant hence dropped in.  Was given a small table for 3 of us but eventually moved us to another table.   Probably will come here for chicken rice but not anything else.  You need to ask for service so service attendant busy on other things.  Dragging waste basket through the restaurant when others eating is highly inappropriate.
Love the duck rice. Always a must try
"TasThe food was delicious, freshly prepared, and full of flavor. Great service and cozy atmosphere. Highly recommended for a satisfying meal!te good"
"Disappointing experience. Chicken was dry, too little skin for the 2 pax set. Didn't recall it to be of such standard last time. We had better versions nearby."
Pork belly is nice. Really soft and it melts when you put it on your mouth.  Haven't tried many others but I would say this is one of the  nice pork belly. The fat melts when you eat. All about preferences.  The cost of the dish is about mid $15+
I ordered twice using their qr code for takeaway (the one displayed on the counter). And both times I get an unexplained USD0.00 charge a few minutes after I completed my payment! First one was at Capital U Pte Ltd and second at Stripe. So there was 2 transactions each time. One for Five Star and another for those random places. Weird that both charges are in USD! @owner can you pls take a look at this before someone gets scammed! Will update my rating once I get a reply!
"Ordered hot plate tofu, was served Claypot tofu instead. After alerting the service staff, the claypot tofu was removed with the promised to change it to hot plate tofu instead. But at the end, we were replaced with same claypot tofu served on the hot plate!!"
"Comfort chicken rice. Fresh, well cooked."
Food is ok. Service non-existence and super slow
"Bai Ji Wei Dao Huan Ke Yi,Jie Ge Lue Gui. Wan Shang Kai Dao Shen Ye 2Dian.

Best chicken rice so far!! The veggie side dishes r great too.
Chicken is good and rice is fragrant. Tie Ban Dou Fu is good too.
It's just a plate of chicken rice. Everything taste normal.
Definitely one of the better chicken rice shops in singapore. Chicken is soft (smooth) and tasty. the veges fried in garlic are always good along with the toufu
Unethical staff treatment. Staff was rude and impatient. Food is slow and missing items.
"We ordered individual servings of chicken thigh and chicken rice. The chicken meat was tender, rice not too oily.Bean sprouts with salted fish tasted ok.

Tasty food overall.

Food ordered online via scanning a QR code. They have quite a variety of dishes other than chicken rice so we took awhile to navigate the online menu."
"Surprisingly decent chicken rice for what looked like a lacklustre stall front at about 10pm. Agree with the other reviews, quite expensive for what it was ($7 for normal takeaway serving)"
Loads of delicious protein options and veggie sides. I always go hungry and leave with tummy full and very satisfied. Staff are wonderful too
The chicken rice is delicious. I recommend you to come and try it. There are other menus as well. It is located in the center city. It is convenient to travel if you are staying in that area. The staff provides good service and the restaurant is clean.
"Overpriced chicken rice due to tourist. Definitely not the best chicken rice, it's just average."
"Year after year we were there to celebrate reunion, birthdays and gatherings there. Food choice hasn't changed much but pricing definitely has!! Plus the service also lacks a lot from before. Maybe due to shortage of staff and lots of customers."
"The reason why I'm leaving this review is because one of the main service staff in charge of serving dishes including touching plates, cutlery and food items, got down on his hands and knees to pick up a receipt that dropped on the floor (picture of floor attached). Did not wash his hands and continued to handle food."
"The kampong chicken is cooked just nice, not overly cooked. Chicken has no unhealthy fats and meat is tender not meshy. Portion is just nice for me ! Rice is special as it is nice and yet not as oily as others. Chicken rice chilli is perfect. Definitely the best place to go for chicken rice.

Tze char is good, love their tofu, prawn paste chicken, seafood youtiao, salted egg pork, wide variety of vegetable options and many other dishes. Mango dessert and their warm desserts are irresistible. Frequent by locals mainly."
Chicken rice is good.
"Not gonna lie,if you think chicken rice become boring,you can try their xo fried rice . OMG,so good.Very delicious."
"delicious steam kampung chicken rice, convenient location, friendly service, good atmosphere "
"If only i can give zero.
I ordered half roasted chicken and requested breast meat to be placed separately. I was shocked when it arrived because the breast meat were so little and theres only 3 little pieces of skin.

They charged me for wet towels which i never use.
I was being blamed when i asked why they charged me for something i never use.

Meat was dry.
Rice got no fragrance.
Service not bad."
"First experience in Singapore and was the best start.

The fried chicken and rice are so much different than what you will get in Europe. The steamed chicken is a little dry, so I would suggest the fried one.

Also, get some Jasmin tea to get the full experience."
All the dishes we ordered were great!!! Best place for local food.
"While it is most famous for kampung chicken, the chilli chicken, crab pepper, crab salted egg etc are worth a shot as well. Never disappointed with any dish here."
"Finally I found chicken rice without chicken.

Chicken alone cost $5.80++.
Rice $1.20++

Expensive, not nice. Only the ginger taste above average."
11/10. The food was good! Would eat again
"28jan2025
0720pm

good foods from slow kitchen
reasonable price consider fair portion size
poor staff hospitality, fierce, slow, zero smile, zero attention

first and LAST visit"
Severely overpriced tourist trap with average taste. Honestly appalled at the serving of chicken they have the gall to sell as upsized. There are much better and affordable options within 100m radius...
"My family and I have been coming here almost every Sunday for 18 years. E started coming here when we lived in Siglap. 10 years ago, we moved to Clementi and continued driving all the way here.

We love sitting outdoors and the food is consistently good. The staff know us by name and treat us very well. It is not cheap compared to Chin Chin but it is worth it. We usually order a big plate of boneless, skinless breast meat for a family of 4. Plus pork chop, youtiao and kailan."
"Incredible experience here. The food was so good, and the chicken rice is easily one of the best I've had. Highly recommend. Also, this spot stays open later than the other locations."
"Honestly, I don't recall the chicken being so dry. Not sure why they're still popular, seems more like a place for nostalgia. You can actually see how dry the chicken is in my pictures. Or maybe their other dishes are nice? Kinda went for nostalgia and guess I likely won't be going back."
"Mediocre food but charge exorbitant price!

Look at the pathetic tofu, 4 small pieces at $9????? This is before gst and service charge."
"Frankly speaking , quantity and quality are both only passable grading.

Chicken breast is dry and it's flat because the slap the meat
Chicken thigh is not bad and roast skin is acceptable.
Portion isn't a lot and most disappointing is they slap the meat , typical way of handling the chicken breast by slapping the meat they creating more potion from one portion but it cause the meat to be dry!!

Service just pass , classic staff 9/10 questions don't know how to answer.

Pricing definitely on the high side but is acceptable $18 (before GST) for half chicken"
"Ping Pan niWei wazu,Mei Wei sikatutadesu"
"Food average, there's a nicer chicken rice down the road at katong shopping centre.

Really rude staff who seem to hate their own lives and take it out on you. Especially the uncle on shift 4th December 2024, 3.50pm.

Real customer you may check cctv to verify, I am sitting at the table right beside the counter as I type this."
Definitely a win in the chicken rice department but they have so much more. Highly recommend the handmade tofu.
"Excellent chicken rice with side dishes like fried omelette,  seafood dashes and other fine dishes. Look for Miss jes and she will be happy to serve you some recommeded dishes . She is the most Prettiest among the ladies. Superb food and superb service . You will not regret coming to this restaurant."
Standard dropped a fair bit. Set lunch not worth the price. Felt very rushed for my lunch as they cleared my plates the minute I finished. Gotta stop them in the act...
Take away packet of normal chicken rice too expensive at S$7/- abit on the highside. Nothing special.
This is 25$ worth of prawn. Be careful before coming here.
This was 36 dollars
"Ordered for takeaway, my usual tried and tested. Standards have really gone down today. Seafood fried rice was white, soft rice, and no wok hey at all. Kailan was floppy and yellow
Their signature tofu was hard and sauce was gloopy. Don't know what went on with the chef but didn't finish nor enjoy the food at all."
Not bad if you like Kampung chicken! Wet towel Charge + 5% Svc Charge + 9% GST on top of the sub-total.

"Ordered takeaway for a family of 6, was told
that there was a maximum amount of black sauce to be given. I requested for more for kids but the service lady was very reluctant to give extra. When given, she threw the packet of black sauce into my takeaway bag. (It was a Philipina lady cashiering at the time, wearing spectacles)

Food is decent but won't be back due to the service."
Turned away from the gym to have chicken rice
"I ordered the chicken rice set with vegetables and homemade tofu, top up a small amount for warm barley water (which was a generous big mug!). Paid close to $16 for the set. The roasted chicken was quite dry and bland, the chicken rice was not as fragrant as the other more popular brands. Chilli was thick though and not bad (compared to others which are usually diluted). Tofu was very normal and the Kai Lan was a bit raw. Food wise normal standard nothing to shout about but service was good -- from serving staff to cashier, I gave 5 star, even told me can return the wet towel so it won't be charged. Unfortunately, there was a family with kids banging on the table loudly and playing, which affected the atmosphere. Otherwise I would have rated that area higher."
"One of the top 10 chix rice in SG.
Chilli got kick, consistent stamdard."
It really is 5 star
"This is the 2nd review after more than 3 years. The quality has improved as the last 2 years it was subpar compared to 2020. I suppose the pandemic affected the quality due restricted resources, labour crunch etc.

The chicken rice's chicken breast meat was good. So were the condiments of spicy chili, ginger-garlic puree & sesame oil mix & sweeten savoury black sauce. The soup is tasty too. Best of all, the rice is fluffy, soft & flavourful.

We will be back again to try more dishes.

2024-SEP-20"
The spinach dish comes with roots. Best not to order.
Perfect for an excellent chicken rice! Best in town
The flavour is still good but their quantity has gone down a lot. Chicken rice very little considering the price.. used to be a bit bigger at least... disappointed
"Today 17 Sept, I realised that east coast road shop charged 9% GST. Bought a packet of white chicken breast meat rice cost $7.09. Meat about 7 slices,  2 thin slices of cucumber. Taste ok but overall not worth it."
Great chicken rice -- famous for it and that's all we had. Chili and broth were amazing
"Very established chicken rice place, good food, fish soup was great! The white rice tasted good but I would prefer it to be less salty.
Edit Sep 2024: Rice is nice and warm, and I like the hot soup. But why not warm up the chicken meat as well? It's like a wet blanket to have warm rice, hot soup, but cold chicken  "
"Will never visit again!!!  Went with some overseas guests since Boon Tong Kee East Coast was closed. What a huge mistake! Bill came up to almost $200 which I don't mind paying if the food is up to standard. Apart from the chicken, don't ever order the rest of the dishes.  Fish maw soup was absolutely horrible ($35++) and my guests left much of the food behind."
Superb food.
Chicken is tender with aroma chicken rice and chili. Best combo
"Food was average.
First time i ordered chicken rice and their default was NON deboned. That is what they tell me. They say, want debone, must say.... well.... been so SO MANY chicken rice stall. First time told of this. Dont think will come back to buy from them anymore. Any stalls that by default DONT debone, i will not return. Too bad minimum 1 star. Else i would have given 0 star..

Service of staff arent fantastic. They give a very, too bad, u didnt inform, not my problem kind of reply. Other than that, all are average.

The outlet beside have a much friendlier pricing for such a location late night. Sin hoi sai is much better and staff are much more eager  to service u too."
The rice was tantalising the chicken was roasted to perfection I would recommend this place
"It's not the prettiest restaurant, but the food was very good.  There were many great options to choose from."
"Slightly above average chicken rice, not wow or anything but I felt they were a tad overpriced if you're just looking for some comfort chicken rice."
"The food was nice,curry faish head is the BEST.
Kampung chicken rice also got taste too."
"Bought 4 packets of chicken rice and fu yong omelette for takeaway from this place. Although the food was top-notch, rice was fragrant and chicken was tender, all this was ruined because of the service. They missed out the fuyong omelette from my takeaway. Granted, I was at fault for not checking my purchase, but the kicker to it was that they missed out so many items that makes up the hainanese chicken rice experience. Missing dark soya sauce, chili sauce, cucumber and minced garlic in most of the orders. The feeling of being hurt by the service is overwhelming cause their food is indeed good. All those taking takeaway beware. Please open up the boxes and check if everything is in order."

"Stopped here for a quick bite to eat before our flight and the food was incredible! Ordered the chicken rice, shrimp and sweet and sour shrimp. The lady at the front was so nice and accommodating. Would HIGHLY recommend!"
Super nice! You need to try! Yummy!
The food was great! Chicken was served cold as their signature style. Has indoor and outdoor area. A must try place to eat at Katong area
"Chicken rice came quickly but the rest of the dishes... squid, vegetables, drinks, etc came 45min later.  Ended up eating plain rice first.  Ate the dishes 45min later without rice "
"Hello, I am a man who was often coming here and ordering seafood fried rice. Thank you very much for your service."
Found a fly in the food. Disgusting.

Wide variety of food on the menu. The chicken rice set is average at best with the roast chicken being very dry. The bee hoon in egg gravy has no taste. Fast service but overall disappointing experience.
"Venue has the authentic kampong feel with modern conveniences. Staff were very responsive and helpful.

We ate chicken rice and beside pork belly. One of the best I have tried in my 10 plus years living in Singapore."
"Dry and unflavorful. They used to be delicious, I can't believe how bad it is now. And for $7 for standard chicken rice I would have hoped for some fluffy rice but it was dry bland. Chicken was also dry. Not a good place for chicken rice anymore"
"Ji Rou Bu Cuo Chi,Dan Ji Fan Mei You Mei You Ji You De Xiang Qi"
"Five Star Kampung Chicken Rice has been a staple in East Coast for many years.

Initially just focusing on chicken rice, they now serve a variety of local chinese dishes.

They are famous for their Kampung Chicken, but personally I prefer the the traditional Wenchang Hainese Chicken which is more tender.

The rest of their tze char dishes are very good though. Must try include the Har Cheong Kai, Prawn Rolls, Brocolli with Mushrooms, Sambal Kangkong"
Fu Wu Yuan Fu Wu Tai Du Hao 
Slight above average.
"One of our favourite places to go for dinner. Everything that we ordered were delicious! We especially love the prawns that was served with sweet and spicy (chilli crab style) kind of gravy which was perfect to have it with man tau (mini bun). So far, our dining experience here was good. Service was good and quick too."
Typical example of superior Singaporean cuisine that is on offer in the East side.
Came at 1:15pm on a Saturday wanted to takeaway one packet of chicken breast but your staff just said no more breast meat for both white and roasted chicken but there was a full white chicken hanging on the counter. Ok la give up just rename to One Star Chicken Rice.
Best zichar and service in whole of Katong area
"Long standing and popular restaurant that specialises in chicken rice. We've been wanting to come here for a long time, given how close it is to our house.

Came here on a warm weekend evening, the indoor seating was quite empty. Most of the outdoor seating was occupied, even though a large part of the road has been cordoned off due to construction work.

Cleanliness wise, the place is just ok. We ordered the following :

1) Prawn roll (Ngoh Hiang) - Crunchy ngoh hiang. Great appetiser and full of taste.

2) Steamed Kampung Chicken Rice - Soft chicken. The chilli goes well with the rice and chicken.

3) Roasted Kampung Chicken Rice - Prefer the roasted option in general. So soft and just melts in your mouth.

4) Chicken Gizzard - They only had a smaller portion of this, and charged us accordingly."
Rice not the most fragrant but chili is amazing and niang tofu is excellent. The kampong chicken is fresh and the zhup is very savoury.
Ordered chicken breast from grab. It cost $7.80 without rice. The chicken breast is so little! So disappointing!
"Found this great chicken rice place in East Coast. The chicken was really tender and juicy! Rice was ok, not overly memorable imho.

Service was quick here, but it might be we just ordered 2 plates of chicken rice . But it's a great option if you are looking for affordable meals in the area!"
They Never failed me
"Shop is by the roadside. When i brought friends from overseas to try, I was served steamed chicken without skin. Hot Bobochacha was shown on the menu but i was served a cold one - ice with coconut cream slapped on it 
I don't know if there was an option i didn't select but even if it was oversight on my part the default option should be what is shown in the image.
Overall extremely disappointing and not worth the price"
Had a delicious chicken rice set menu with lots of fresh veggies for our family. The staff was very helpful and friendly with our 2 kids!
This is undisputedly the tastiest steamed chicken rice ever! Chicken is super tender despite being kampung chicken. Rice is cooked to perfection smooth and aromatic. Sauce on the chicken is not too Saltish pushing the flavour of the chicken to another level of culinary. Highly recommended to all foreigners to try their signature chicken rice.
Horrifying! Close to $9 for a plate of chicken rice! Expensive!!! Doesn't justify the inflation till such ridiculous price point.
"This is one of the best chicken rice restaurant I have tried in Singapore. The food was delicious, price is good and there is air conditioning. Friendly store manager/worker on the day. Great experience."
Use to bring oversea relatives and friends to visit here and to taste one of the best chicken rice stores in Singapore.
"One of the best chicken rice for me. Other local food menu also nice. Takeaway order available with bento box.

Worst service u will ever experience. Sad - though food is good but...
Decent chicken rice but a little pricey.
Bad and pricey chicken. Even worst than some of the coffeeshop ones. Will not come back.
Very persistent flys the food tasted like the ones from a hawker centre
One of the best chicken rice in Singapore !! Rice soo yummy !...
Delicious chicken rice! There are layers and layers of flavor there. Really good restaurant.
Offers air-conditioned seating. Chicken is good and rice is not oily. Half portion ($19) serves 2 to 3 people. Has a good range of vegan dishes.
"On a long layover we cabbed it to this restaurant in search of a Hainanese Kampung Chicken fix. Hit the spot, succulent, velvety, smooth flesh that was exactly what we were looking for.

We also got the mango Logan shaved ice.
Cute presentation, too sweet though.

As for price, I get why they have to charge what they do. It's a brick and mortar establishment so it is what it is."
Had my first date here 6 years ago with my now husband. The place has always had such a chill vibe and the food quality has maintained throughout. Love the salted egg pork ribs and Kailan!
Overrated chicken rice and portion given is not value for money. Rice was not fragrant and chicken was a little dry... Soup was too salty to drink. Would recommend Geylang Bahru boneless chicken rice stall if anyone wants a true chicken rice experience for half the price

Everything is always consistently good! Def get the chicken rice and also sweet and sour pork
Nice.is nice
The chicken rice tastes below average
We came thinking we want to order chicken rice but somehow the pricing structure dissuaded me. So we just ordered the curry fish head with just one white rice and shared among 2 of us.  wow it's really a good one to enjoy. I hope you got to read this and order for yourself. Quite spicy and the fish head ia good for 2 with no fishy smell. Bon apetit
Hainan chicken is dry. Service rough and sharp acoustics. There is much better chicken in Singapore
"Decent chicken rice, though not the cheapest. Wouldn't fight my best friend on the shore of a lava lake to get it or anything, but a good option if you're in the area and crave some good old rice with a side of chili and chicken.

White breast meat was slightly more toothsome than desired, while rice was competent but not outstanding. Soup was surprisingly good - peppery and chicken-imbued. Chili was also competent though I wish they wouldn't leave the sauce trays out in the open. Braised eggs were slightly overdone."
"Chicken had the chicken jelly between the skin, which I find pretty gross. Taste was just ok"
"This is one of those place that I will come back from time to time to reminisce that familiar Hainanese  kampong chicken rice. The chicken is leaner and has that chewiness that is not found in others. Comparing between the white (steamed) and roasted chicken, I prefer the former. What I like even more is the rice, which is so firm and full of chicken broth flavour. Besides chicken rice, there is a wide variety of other delectable Chinese dishes that makes dining here a pleasure every time."
Good restaurant
Can change the restaurant name from Five Star Kampung Chicken Rice to Five Star Kampung Skin Rice. More skins than meat and not delicious.
"One of the best chicken rice of Singapore, maybe the best"
Order through app. Service was swift. Food was good.
Steam chicken was excellent ( better than Wee Nam Kee IMHO) Rice also great. Veggies dishes also great.  Service was great. Will come back.
"Very flavourful food and super quick service. They really do have a kampung vibe cuz of the open seating area! :)
Do get their soft breads, they were so yum!"
How can they call themselves Hainanese chicken rice when they serve plain rice for chicken rice?  Lacklustre to be honest :/
"In terms of flavor, it's as good as any chicken rice from regular hawker center. However, it's way pricier here as they charged GST + service. ~10sgd for a regular chicken rice.

The only good part is that you can choose the chicken part when you order with the QR code (extra $ for chicken breast).

Not worth it in my opinion."
Go to place for chicken rice. Can request exclusively for breast and even plain rice if on diet. Chicken is tender and chilli one of the best in SG. The other tze char dishes are stellar as well. Can order and pick up. Lids love the soup
"Food here is reasonably priced although service is quite slow for in person ordering   however online takeaway available here. Overall a good place for people with fixed dietary restrictions, white rice available here too."
Food is good but service is bad
"The manager just made me to wait there even I came first and let two people came after me made payment before me. I am ok to wait but the manager keep blaming me cz I need to use Face ID to unlock my Apple Pay and I waste time. First time when I unlock my Apple Pay, she canceled my bill and serve the first cut queue customer. Second time when I wave my phone to the machine again canceled my payment and let the second cut queue  customer pay. And this time , I ask why u alway take away the machine when I wanted to pay. The lady manager said cz I am too slow and she think my Apple Pay is not ready and let other people pay before me. But what she thought is not the real. When I am ready to pay, she remove the machine and say I am not ready. At last still shouting at me that she is not wrong , I am the one who is wrong and nothing wrong with letting me wait there. I really donot understand her imagination on when I wanted to pay and really donot understand why she can blame on me and shouting."
"I have ignored the other reviews as I had a craving for chicken rice and now I regret it. A serving of chicken for 1 pax costs $5.80 and I was shocked when they asked me if I would like rice with my chicken RICE as the price is exclusive of rice. The measly amount of chicken came with two 1-ply cucumber slices as thin as my patience for overpriced establishments. Morever, there was service charge and GST on top of the $7 plate of chicken rice. All in all, not worth."
"The roast chicken was not aromatic or fragrant. The rice was somewhat flat with no chicken stock flavour.
However, the bean sprouts with salted fish and the prawn roll were good."
Very stingy with chilli. Do not order delivery
"Quality chicken rice, reasonable price for a restaurant. Other than chicken rice, this stall also serves a variety of other dishes which are not bad.Thanks boss for the treat. Picture shown is half chicken."
"Find the chicken rice overpriced for the server and quality. I'm a small eater but the portion is too little for me, which is rare. The chicken is pretty bony, not much meat. Charge gst and service. The service is minimal. You need to order at the counter and find the condiments yourself. Just go to other tables to look. The service is serving the food and clearing the plates after you are done."
Excellent chicken rice choice.
"Very good and generous amount of sauces. Good chilli, good minced ginger. White chicken isn't the soft tender type though, it's a little tough."
"The service is truly appalling - we were just ladling out individual portions of the chilli sauce when the serving staff came to try to take away the sauce tray, and just stood there hurrying us while persistently moving the tray away. I have not encountered such rude serving staff for a long time. No matter how good your food is, please train your staff better."
"Expensive siah $8.51 for a chicken breast rice!!!!!!...rice good, flavourful and not too soft. Chicken a liiiittle dry but the chili...so salty! Other than that service was fast at lunch and they served soup that tasted gingery."
"I had a strong craving for chicken rice late at night. It was my very first chicken rice store that's not located inside a food court. It didn't disappoint. Amazing food, great customer service, clean bathrooms and great outdoor seatings!

Food:

- White chicken  (10/10): This was my favorite dish of the day!  It's a chicken rice restaurant for a reason. The meat texture was mildly chewy, and the seasoning wasn't too oily, the portion was satisfying enough! 

- Chicken rice  (10/10): The loyal companion of those chicken meat! The rice wasn't soggy. It had great texture and flavor! It was so good, I got 2 bowls of these mouthwatering rice, one was simply not enough!

- BBQ Stingray (7/10): Not the best, the sauce (it was delicious though) given was too little and the meat was kind of dry.

- White Garlic Bak Choy  (9/10): This was pretty good, but it wasn't served warm. Seasoning was just right (wasn't too salty) unlike some other restaurants serving the same dish!

Overall, I would recommend this restaurant. The only thing I would say is if you decide to get their stingray, maybe ask for more of the sauce (I can't guarantee if they would meet your request, but it's worth a try!"
"Top marks

Another excellent meal at Five Star Kampung. I've been there quite a few times and have tried the chicken rice at the outlets in River Valley and Cheong Chin Nam too. All brilliant! I've been their fan for the chicken rice for about over 10 years. Although their restaurants themselves are small, the food certainly packs a punch. That's a positive. Food is served fast and efficiently. The service from all the staff is excellent and attentive. There's a great variety of other options beside their chicken dishes. Thanks for a lovely meal, as always! Five stars well deserved, of course"
"Simply perfection, I have been in love with this dish since I attended UWCSEA many years ago. Remembered going out of boarding school across the road to have some. The pandan rice with chicken, chili and ginger sauce are a masterpiece combo."

Chicken was ice cold when it came .
"Staff has seriously poor attitude,especially the female staff that speaks with a phillipino accent.
Very impatient and abrasive"
A reasonably priced location for chicken rice
"I think their food is around the average, but I can't give more than 3 star when I think about the price. To be honest, it's expensive for the quality and the environment. And not worth it with service charge. I thought it was just a coffee shop but they got 5% of service charge. Their chicken rice is average. Fried ban with chilli crab source taste good."
"Kampung chicken rice, what else could be better? The chicken was pretty good. The salted egg pork ribs was good but portion was tiny. The star of the show has to be the sweet potato leaves! This was incredible! Will be back just to eat this! Price wise it's slightly higher then a usual chicken rice joint but it's worth it I would say. The drumstick chicken rice was $7.50 so not too bad."
"Chicken is 3/5 for Kampong standard, Chilli is 5/5 (kick) and soup is 4/5. Overall 4/5 for this place and I rank this in between WNK and BTK.

Only wished the sambal stingray is less pricey."
"Great kampung chicken rice, tender, juicy, tasty! deep fried calamari very good too."
"This place has been on my to-try list for a while now, so when I was running some errands in the vicinity, I had to get some of their white kampung chicken to try...

Taste: kampung chicken tends to be leaner, hence their meat will be a little tougher & drier than normal. Love that they give 3 different sauces, the ginger sauce is a real flavour bomb

Price: rather pricey at $20+ for half a chicken with no rice

TLDR if you live nearby and need a quick chicken rice fix this place will probably suffice "
"Decent quality of kangkong and mee goreng, but what you should avoid ordering here is their lime juice.  It was just too strong and sweet.  Someone had a very liberal hand pouring out the cordial."
Omg the chicken rice taste so good. Portion are just nice and price is good. Usually frequent this place during weekends
The chicken is tender and rice is filled with fragrance!  A go to chicken rice stall for me!
"Like the food, fried rice was awesome"
Took more than 40 mins for food to be ready. Taste was below par. Not worth the wait nor was it worth the price.
Food is amazing but quite expensive and for home delivery in grab they send too small portions of chicken. Service staff are too grumpy probably they are too busy.
Yummy tasty
Great experience
Not too bad for a chicken rice! Can be quite crowded but worth the wait I must say.
Best chicken rice in Singapore worth to go and they have a few outlets in sg.
Best Chicken Rice in singapore!
"One of the best Kampong chicken store in Singapore. Been eating their chicken for the last 20 years. White chicken tender and juicy; Roasted chicken is roasted to perfection with cripsy skin.

There are several 5 stars chicken stores in SG but their flagship store at Katong is the best!

It can get pretty packed in the evening... but the seats turn over pretty fast.

Parking can be a nightmare but if you park at the malls. You should be fine."
Chicken was tender and rice fragrant. Foreign guest enjoyed the meal.
"Ate 5star periodically as i stay nearby. It has deteriorated much... The past 2 visits i made there were dead cockroaches on the chair (indoors). And the other time there was a few black strands of hair in their food.

No matter how good your food is... And especially for the price you are charging i think basic hygiene is a must?

Chicken taste tougher thru the years too. Really miss Boon Tong Kee beside them who left 1 or 2 years ago probably due to rental dispute.

Please improve the quality of your chicken and spruce up your hygiene maybe?

All the best."
One of the best
"Ordered half kampung white chicken, baby kailan with oyster sauce and prawn roll, chicken was tender and had the sweet fresh taste though not so much meat on it, kailan was crunchy fresh but abit oily, the prawn roll was crispy outside tasty soft on it inside. Food was generally loaded with MSG so flavor can't go wrong, but they had extensive menu of all my childhood favorite Singaporean dishes, great place to come for huge family meals, can load up on the sauces provided, those really enhances the flavor experience"
"Five Star Kampung Chicken Rice & Kitchen deserves all five stars and more! This place serves up the most mouthwatering chicken rice in Singapore. The succulent and tender chicken, perfectly seasoned with aromatic herbs and spices, is a true delight. The fragrant rice, cooked to perfection, is the perfect accompaniment. The chili sauce is just the right amount of spicy, adding an extra kick to every bite. The friendly staff and cozy ambiance make dining here an absolute pleasure. If you're a fan of authentic and delicious chicken rice, this is the place to be!"
Best chicken rice in sg. Better than BOON Tong Kee.
Always a pleasure since 15 years there and still same quality food ... I love it
"Food was below average. Rice tasted almost plain and some parts of the chicken was tough. Serving is small and price is high. We ordered two chicken rice and a sweet and sour pork. One ice water and one lime juice. Added up to $50. Just as we started eating, the server also came and cleared all our sauces as other tables need it. Disappointing  and not worth the price."
Great chicken rice in Singapore
"Wow..really is '5 star's..due to the price and not really the taste.
1 plate of chicken at $5.80 and doesn't event come with rice. Of course, one may say there's air-con and 'service' but I am not sure if eating chicken rice is any different from hawker centre, kopitiam and 'restaurant'. Probably better to go for the set meal starting at $12.80++ rather than the a-la-carte for 1.
The taste is alright, and I think I probably visit again if I crave for chicken rice on my birthday and needing to 'treat' myself. Peace!"
Very good Hainanese Chicken and Cereal Prawn 
"It tastes different from those mainstream, to me this stall is more authentic kind of flavor.

"Has great chicken rice. The meat is tender and the rice is flavourful. Most importantly, chilli is great! It has allows for call ups and pre order so that collection is prompt by the road side."
"Nice place to fine in
Good foods
Affordable price"
The chicken is tender and juciy and it worth the price.
The kampong chicken is tender and juicy and goes well with the spicy Chilli..very flavour lful and not too hard..their beancurd hotplate is also good
"Fresh chicken , tenders meat . Good taste with the price"
Affordable and quiet tasty traditional chicken rice. A must try
"The price of one packet of chicken rice, with extra chicken and rice costs $10.90. The amount of extra rice and chicken are so miserable which doesn't justify the cost. It's lesser than buying 2 packets of chicken rice."
"For me and my son, I ordered a 1 pax serve with more meat, rice, a tofu with 2 plate of rice. Meat seemed a bit thin. And unfortunately my son doesn't want more tofu; I thought the tofu was reasonable smooth and yummy.

A guy would probably be satisfied with 1 pax + additional meat. A pity there's no veg to go with the meal."
Food is sooo yummy!
Not our 1st time having their chicken rice and its maintained it's standards throughout the decades. Generous amount roasted chicken breast that we love so much. Love the chilli that's amazingly spicy and the punch of fresh ginger that goes so well mixed with the dark soya sauce over the fragrant rice!
"The ambiance of the restaurant is also noteworthy - it's simple and unassuming, but with a cozy and welcoming atmosphere that makes you feel right at home. And the friendly and attentive staff are always ready to recommend their favorite dishes and help you navigate the menu."
"""Five Star Hainanese Kampung Chicken Rice uses healthier and leaner kampung chicken, which is low in cholesterol, has less fat and more fibre."
Although place was crowded during peak hour. The waiting time is kinda short. Worth to try. Delicious chicken rice.
"Really good chicken rice, using kampung chicken as the main ingredient. Texture of kampung chicken are generally tougher but they've perfected the recipe. 2 downsides - they are pretty expensive for the portions ($30 for 2 pax) and soup is too salty."
"It's the kind of restaurant that you go to because it opens till 2am.
After you are a local who eats there for the first time, you will realize there are better chicken rice and zi char dishes elsewhere.
There is little interaction with the staff as you order things from the app but yet you pay a service tax at the end. Sad little place far from it's glory days."
Authentic chicken rice. Good portion and reasonable price. Locals' favourite chicken rice in the east side.
"Just visited 5 star this evening. Took 30 minutes for the chicken to be delivered Horrible customer experience.
- the place was 30% occupied as it was 930pm
- The blonde haired Chinese gentleman was very curt. We felt he was doing us a favour by serving us.
- he delivered the Kailan after 10 minutes,
- 15 minutes into our waiting he delivered the rice and
- 30 minutes into our wait, he delivered the chicken
When we asked for the soup, they sulkily delivered the soup.

Possible too arrogant for their own good! Time to look for options."
Had a normal plate of chicken rice which is way over priced. Just the chicken itself is $6.30 and portion is the same as any chicken rice stall and rice is additionally charged at $1.30. The whole pkate came up to $8.50 after tax. Chicken is dry and rice is not flavourful for that price.
Food and service was good. But the online ordering site was abit slow
Decent food... must try in a local joint if visiting Singapore. Fied Tofu with vege and fried rice were great. Steamed chicken and rice were liked too.
"Enjoyed the Kampung chicken rice, which was tasty. Their side dishes complemented the meal. Affordable prices, enjoyable for the whole family."
Quite nice to give it a try for Chicken rice lovers. Good local food.
love the kampong chicken 
"Above average chicken rice
Air con"
"Walking around Joo Chiat, this place seemed very popular with locals. Good food but wish they had stated on the menu which meals had chilli on it as we ordered something I couldn't eat."
"Very rude, doesn't answer when i asked for my order. They didnt give my que number and when i asked they said will send me. But later argue that i didn't come to collect the food!! VERY VERY RUDE AND SO POOR SERVICE! FOR SINGAPORE STANDARD ITS 1 STAR OK ."
"Chicken rice is superb,
It's my go to place in the east, I almost eat thr for 2-3 times in a week."
"Good place and delicious food in here, the staff very nice."
"OMG loved this place. Just happened to walk by looking for solo dinner easy, quick, authentic. This bustling little outlet has it in spades and the food was delicious.

I had not used this QR code menu arrangement before. Wonderful, order on your phone, add more if you need to. Great choices and really busy with locals from all backgrounds.

Super good value, pork sha shui + fried rice + Tiger beer = 20SGD."
It's name and taste are not the new thing among locals and foreigners.
"If you ever try Kampung free range farming chicken, you probably not going back to usual cage farming meaty chicken. This restaurant was one of the popular one for their Kampung chicken rice. Using fresh chicken was the key requirements so to achieve the fresh tenderness meat texture. Sweet and tender. Simply Delicious. .

They do serve many other dishes from their hot kitchen at the back. No more hard copy Menu, instead scanning the QR code provided by them to make your orders.

"Food quality dropped, staff kept serving wrong orders."
Chicken rice is good. You can scan QR code to order. Queue is fast.
So-so food and prices. Service average
"Can't go wrong with chicken rice here, love their chilli sauce as well. Open until late night, perfect for a late night bite in the east."
"Delicious good, great location, attentive staff."
Amazing food!!
"Nice food, I like roasted chicken most, spicy squid also one of my favorite. Rice portion is bigger & cheaper. Overall will be back again"
"Good, tasty, fast and simple meal"
Really like it ..can't forget
Price scarily high $11.30 + 8gst for a small bean sprouts with salted fish.
"Horrendous service.  After waiting for 25 minutes for the curry fish head, only to be told at the end that they ran out of white rice and expect us to eat curry fish head with chicken rice, which do not go together at all.  Staff are generally apathetic and not customer centred."
"Good place for chicken rice if you are in Katong area. Might be a queue, but place is worth it."
Love their chicken porridge! To die for ..... yum yum
Dry and tough chicken parts. There are regular Chinese eateries with way better kampung chicken rice
Cashier was really rude! Service staff was good tho
"Only Kampung chicken was good
Kampung chicken was tender and juicy, with flavorful Hainanese chili , ginger dip and sweet soy sauce. The rest (seafood wok fry - Zi Char) is very average. Fried sea bass was dry and hard, fish maw in fish maw soup was hard (and the attendant up-sell the more expensive crab meat fish maw version if you do not question), hot plate tofu was okay."
Not the best. Many flies around the table when I was there.
"Food was okay but don't expect quality service at Five Star Kampung Chicken Rice. Patronized the East Coast branch on 13th Dec, 10pm. Cashier was rude and unprofessional. Adamant that customer is wrong and refuse to admit mistake or check when the bill was incorrect. She did not even serve us! Give lame excuse and insincere apology after proven wrong.

Future patrons, make sure you are being filmed on security cams while eating or paying. Otherwise you will be accuse of cheating them!"
"Chicken and rice a must do ,if you are in Singapore"
Nice place. Good food but a little expensive
Bland tasteless and expensive. Must add another $1.2 for rice.
"Its been a long time since i ladt makan.
Tasty but a bit chewy kampong chicken.
Nice chilli to compliment the chicken rice. Carry on makan."
"The chicken is very tender and the rice is extremely fragrant. The chicken rice also comes with very delicious chili sauce, soy sauce and ginger which really helps to enhance the dish.

The tze char dishes are also very yummy with a lot of wok hey, especially the fried egg dishes."
"Love the steamed chicken here. Actually all the food I've tried are of good quality. One of my favourite place for delivered food.
Except the Sotong. While it taste good, they do not remove this layer of outer skin. So it's very stringy and can't swallow properly."
"The chicken rice is super good, there are so many dishes on the manu as well."
Chicken is tender with fragrant rice and goes well with the chilli. Hot plate beancurd is great!
"Definitely not five stars. They cheat so be careful. When you order half or whole chicken with skin on, they take all the skin off the breast portion - who eat dry breast meat without the skin? That's shortchanging people. When I asked for replacement they took some dark meat out. Very dishonest so make sure to look out.

The meat itself isn't as good as it used to be but it's good enough just skinny and not much meat on these kampung chickens."
"One of our favourite Chicken Rice Outlet in the East. Love their roasted chicken, fragance chicken rice and chilli sauce. Super spicy and shiok."
Tender meat with nice skin for the steamed chicken. Rice could add more flavour and chilli could be spicier but overall this is decently good chicken rice
Five Star Chicken rice in Joo Chiat road staff is very lazy. When we ask one of them to pack our take awayleftover food. They bring plastic box to ask us to pack ourselves. The toilet is very crammed in between door that our feet hardly has any ground after using waterhose to wash all over.
Tabao food home for dinner .
"Like their chicken rice smell. Although I am not a fan of kampong chicken, the chicken is not that hard and taste great. I also like their Dong Po Rou,tender and not that fatty."
Excellent kung pao chicken

"I am tempted to give five star because of the restaurant's name.

Rice - not bad
Chicken - tender
Innards - colder than other restaurants but  I guess it's to preserve the freshness. Good.
Soup - hot and nice
Chilli - nice
Ginger - nice

I also had porridge which is served warm. I think it would be nice to serve hotter.

#update on 28 Mar 2022 (one month after first review)#

I came back to try out other dishes, taste are not bad but still not five star yet. However it is definitive few notches above the restaurant next door.

I ordered:
1. Fried Kai Lan
2. Hometown tofu
3. Braised pork belly - rice killer!

#update on 29 Oct 2022#
The porridge is pretty good too. I also had
1. Fish maw soup
2. Thai style tofu"
"All abt the Chicken rice was good. Soup, chilli, chicken and rice."
"Food is good but the recepie keep changing, not same as before. Each time less fun."
"5 stars for 5 star.
One of the best chicken rice here"
"Using a qr code menu to order but the web api is too slow. Understaffed, food took too long. Honey ginger chicken should be removed from the menu."
One star for 'Five Star' chicken. Ordered on the app for collection even though I was already there as the lady at the door taking orders said it would be faster - ended up being the dumping ground for dry and tough chicken parts. I've never tasted such bad chicken in chicken rice before. Very disappointed.
"Chicken nice, vege n soup salty"
"Went for dinner on a Sunday evening. The place was crowded but there was just a short wait for a table. Used to frequent this shop quite often in the past and have not been back for a few years. The standards have not dropped and the chicken is still as good as in the past. The small portion of rice is really quite small, so I would recommend getting the regular portion unless you are not a carbs person. The fried mushroom was pricey but surprisingly delicious and addictive. Fish maw soup is more like seafood soup, with very strong ginger taste."
Excellent chicken rice and juicy smooth chicken
"The taste still the same as before when I Makan it when I was young time.
Never change the taste & recipes..
surprised me still so tasty 
Staffs was so friendly & helpful..
will go back again..."
"Ordered takeaway.

The roasted chicken is so tough, and the chicken seems like they left it overnight. Rice isn't as fragrance as before. Definitely will not visit again"
"Ordered half white chicken and a hotplate tofu and both taste bad, it's way below average. Should have eat at Sin Hoi San instead."
Great supper spot
The chicken I took is per what I expected to be of Top quality and has remained the same since several years ago when I visited. They sell other dishes too.

"You're not in Singapore without chicken rice . One of the best with its steamed chicken, fried tofu sereal, salted egg 'sotong' and got to try steamed chicken liver."
"Another choice of Chicken Rice in Singapore. Not a big restaurant like Boon Tong Kee, Five Stars Kampung CR is kinda local restaurant for the locals. Chicken is rendered and juicy.

Kampung chicken means ""village chicken"" or simply ""free-range chicken"" so there is not much meat.

Staff is attentive. Price is acceptable."
"Five star rating indeed. Rice was really fragrant and i love the chilli and ginger sauces. The kampung chicken is typical kampung-reared, slightly tougher than normal chicken which is still nice. Tofu was decent."
"Best place to have nice and quality chicken rice with tzechar ! I always order drumstick rice though need to top up abit, come on... it is kampong chicken! Worth it and super nice !! I rather pay abit extra than to compromise with taste and quality eslewhere. Been eating here for almost twenty years."
"It's a recommended Hainanese chicken rice restaurant to go with. Their chicken is tender and juicy. Fragrance rice nicely cooked. Though the price is slightly higher, but food is good"
"Simple yet delicious meal, reasonably priced with great staff."
"Chicken Rice (SGD $6.50) @ Five Star Kampung Chicken Rice & Kitchen.
.
Among the famous names, this brand occupies a curious, middle-of-the-pack range, with seemingly equal numbers of fans and detractors.
.
Quality of dishes isn't terrible, but doesn't outshine the top names either, above average and worth a try if in the vicinity.
.
The rice borders moist and dry, fluffy but mild grainy sweet flavour. The chicken, poached or roasted, tends toward thin sliced with a tender texture, and good fresh meaty sweet savoury flavour.
.
The gravy lends decent savoury salty nutty flavour, but fades from memory. Decent dark sweet soy sauce with salty savoury earthy notes, spicy sour sweet chili, and crushed ginger with earthy spice sweet herbal flavour, completes."
"The food here is great.  Min-Soo ordered thr chicken and rice, as a standard Singapore meal everyone should try.  It is very good."
"Our nostalgic place. We enjoy the food here. It can be cowded during dinner time. Service are quick. There are quife a selection of food to choose from, but of course the chicken is a must. They use Kampong chicken. I really like the chili here."
"I have not patronised this place in a long while. Thought I'd give it another chance. Big mistake. HUGE mistake.  Now, I remember why. Pathetic quality. Small portions. The chicken is tough. Rice is stodgy. Chicken cut razor thin, like 5-6 mm in thickness. For 6-7 SGD a serving. Waste of money and time. Would give a negative score if I was able to. Don't bother coming here."
It's alright. Used to be really good but commercialised now in keeping up with the times
"My family and I frequents this place at least once a month, over the years. Yesterday again, but this time was disappointed with the serving of a whole kampung chicken. For some reason they have decided to debone the chicken but there is no way to hide the fact that the portion is reduced drastically. The four of us usually have our fill with previous serving but not this time. At $36 it's way too expensive for this reduced portion. Won't be coming back anytime soon. Am sure can find more reasonable servings elsewhere despite the present chicken supply issue."
Overall taste good and price is acceptable.
"Fresh, fragrant! The Yangzhou fried rice is a winner for both my husband and I, also the sambal kangkong! We ordered deep fried sotong (yum) and also the tofu dish. All so good and we really like the option of having Small, Medium, or Large portion!

The uncle was very attentive and so quick on his feet to give us the condiments once he saw us liking it. Also the auntie taking order! Overall a wholesome dining experience. Will come here again when we visit East Coast."
"To be honest, nothing very special about the chicken rice.  In my opinion, over priced.
The Sambal Kangkong is also not spicy enough"

"Visited them with a few clients this evening. Seriously we have never had worse chicken etc than this! It was cold , dry, hard and tasteless. The soup was super salty. As for the rest of the dishes, it was pathetic... We decided to just go eat elsewhere. It's a shame. ONCE BITTEN TWICE SHY."

Love their 3 egg spinach ! One of the best in Singapore so far. Tried other dishes as well and it's pretty good too ! Recommended !
I bought a mixed roasted and white chicken with high expectations. Unfortunately the chicken was cut and dry. The service staff was helpful but the quality of the chicken is suspect this time.
Quick Andrew nice food
Yummy chicken rice
"Not sure why I would order chicken rice from 5 star when there are so many other chicken rice stalls who I think is better. Whilst it is marketed as kampung chicken, it really seems to be aneroxia chicken. I would rather have the chicken rice at Katong shopping centre or even the one at Mei Yuan coffee shop which is several shops towads Neptune. This is just a personal preferance as you can imagine."
Difficult to get the roast chicken. Always sold out. Left only white chicken
"Totally a let down. Ordered takeaway for half a steamed white chicken at $17 (which is much more expensive than its competitors as well as most other hainanese chicken rice stores).  The half chicken portion was miserable, and seemed  like less than half a chicken. Taste wise also not as good as quite a lot of other places selling hainanese chicken rice at a much cheaper price.  I will not order from this place again."
The hainam chicken rice very nice but the fried noodle to sour. Over all are very nice.
The chicken rice is great but not the greatest i ever ate in my life. The restaurant is clean and the staff are friendly. The price of the chicken rice are reasonable.
Not the best but can certainly satisfy a craving if any. Good but can be inconsistent.
Beverage price is not listed in the menu. Such a practise are unacceptable. Told the supervisor and she gave said prices are seasonal.
Delicious for singaporean food lovers
"They used kampong chicken which is smaller in size and the meat is chewier than chickens rear on chicken feed. If you have 3 big eaters, probably order 1 whole chicken. The chilli is good, spicy and savoury."
Comfort food at its best. Must try
Very consistent chicken rice with roadside pick up. Kids love them!
Chicken is delicious.
Eat chicken rice there 
Chicken is tender and juicy. Rice is fluffy and fragrant. Lime juice is also delicious. The service is unexpectedly good. Truly Five Star.
Good kampong chicken rice. Only chicken rice made it. Ignore all other dishes available.
"Wanted to taste different dishes, so here's what we got: perfect baby kailan (garlic), yummy fried rice (char siew & shrimp) and decent sweet and sour pork. Friendly and quick service. We'll be back!"
The food quality there is good as always.  Food delivered is fast as well.
"extremely extremely slow service, gave up waiting and asked for refund"
"Least oily chicken rice i have had in my entire life. The fragant aroma of the rice is fantastic. I like roast chicken, the rice, the roast chicken, the chilli, fabulous trio!"
Quiet place
"Love the ability to drive up and order on the spot, while waiting for in the car. You can pay by PayWave using your credit card or your Apple Pay mobile device; they come to your car and you just have to tap on the payment device. Within 10 -15 minutes they deliver to your car. So convenient for us especially when we are tired and just want to go home with our food soon. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
Very nice kampong chicken rice.
Great alternative to BTK. Definitely worth a try
Not bad. Above average quality.
"Kampung chicken porridge, if you are craving for mid night supper or gonna have a late night dinner, this will be a good place, and their chicken is really smooth and delicious, we added additional dishes like Dong Po Rou and spinach, yum yum also especially the Dong Po Rou "
Why would you give a paying customer a chicken portion that's solely made out of the rib cage and bones? Even if the customer didn't request a specific section of the chicken this is just plain lazy and insulting. Disappointing.
Nice chicken meat. Not so expensive. Money equal to quality
 And it's really best one you can have it. I love it.
Had to wait 20 minutes for a takeaway order. They now charge more for chicken breast. The good thing is they can give you soup in a takeaway container for an nominal charge. Probably best to order the chicken separate and the rice separate. I ordered the set and found the chicken was much too dry. Their chilli is watered down as compared to yesteryear.
"This chicken rice is always my favourite, although the price is higher than most chicken rice in SG.
White chicken is definitely my fav of fav dish here, the meat is tender, juicy and amazing."
"Quite a letdown. Chicken is cold, side dish is cold. Everything is cold. Breast meat isn't tender. Can eat lah. But not anywhere near expected quality."
Ordered through Food Panda. Am shocked when I received the order.  The vegetables (medium size at $12.90 ) and Cereal Prawns sold at $20.40 serving portion is so small/little. Disappointing.
"Delicious chicken rice, kampung chicken was cold and juicy. Tofu was delicious, soft and hot, and cereal prawns were crunchy, sweet, and slightly salty. Very scrumptious meal, with super authentic food. Arrived early so no waiting time. Place is cold and servers are friendly. Definitely worth a visit, you get to eat local hawker food in an air- conditioned place."
Tastes good but ended up with food poisoning
"We ordered the chicken rice set meal in order to try their other side dishes. The kampong chicken is very tender which is a surprise as it usually tends to be less so. It goes very well with the chilli and rice. One of the side dishes that stand out is the braised pork belly - very flavourful and not too hard. Overall the food is delicious. However, if I'm to come back next time, I would probably order ala carte as the portion for the set meal can be a little small for the price to be fully satisfied."
One of the best chicken rice places. Their chicken soup is awesome.
"Tried the Five Star signature set and honestly, the kampong chicken was a refreshing surprise. I did not expect the kampong chicken to be that tender and refreshing (but I believe it also helps when I chose to have the chicken thigh meat or Ji Wei Bu Fen for my set). Ordered the Salted egg pork rib and it was tasty! Salted egg sotong tasted more like regular calamari with a tiny hint of salted egg sauce. It tasted better when we dipped the sotong with more of the Salted egg pork rib's sauce. If you wish to come here and try the food, I would recommend you to order their signature set and go for the chicken thigh parts. Skip the prawns (over-fried and it's a little dry for me) and their handmade tofu (tasted a hint of sour-ish to me). Dong Po Rou or braised pork belly was ok, loved the tender pork skin but some part of the pork was tough and hard to chew). Salted egg pork rib is pretty good and you can try if you want to."
"One of the best kampong chicken rice in katong area.
It has other delicious items on the menu to try."
Best #HNCR in Singapore
Not too bad
Usually many people do pick non peak hours if you can.
About time to boycott Five Star at East Coast. So many people has been patronising this place for many years and now service is atrocious. Rude staff and always saying no breast meat when so many chickens hanging. Boon tong kee next door is 1000 times better from every aspect.
Good but can't give it 5 stars though
Five Star will be a long stretch. The taste of their chicken is average and they look like kampong chicken which are smaller and less bloated than the usual ones from factory farm. The big ripped off is the stir-fried sweet potatoes leaves that cost $19.
"Just go to boon tong Kee down the road, don't waste ur money here. Hawker center chicken rice has better standard. One star"
"Tender chicken meat, fragrant gravy.
Yummy! "
Great chicken rice + sotong sambal at midnight
"Ordered more than 20 dollars of food and asked for one packet of chilli sauce, staff was rude and refuse to give claiming that we did not order the right dish to be given the chilli sauce?! I ask to pay for it since they were so stingy but was told no again, there is no way a chicken rice restaurant was going to provide you with a packet of chilli sauce. Ridiculous attitude from their staff too. Such a shame the way they are treating their customers will never patronise again"
Addictive chicken rice! Indescribable with words
Chicken rice was gd
Great chicken rice. Lives up to its name. A regular deliveroo go-to of ours...
"First time going to a restaurant to have chicken rice, ordered a 1 person chicken, it was $5 and a $7.50 X.O fried rice.

When the food arrive, it was just that plate of chicken and the X.O fried rice. I asked where was the rice, the staff told me there is no rice. I was really super shocked, did I just paid $5 for a small plate of chicken only ? Nonsense. There wasn't any indication for additional rice.

But apart from this rip off situation. The chicken was really good and the X.O. fried rice was O.M.G best I ever had. It was fragrance with some crispy thing in it. Really yummy.

Got ripped off once, will probably still be back and order smarter now. The food I really quite good"
The Hainanse chicken rice is really worth trying. Its good. It'll cost a little more but its worth a try. The rice is well cooked and goes well with the chilli sauce and choice of roast or steamed chicken.
"Food is nice. Offers chicken rice with zhi char style orders.
Try the onion omelette, salted egg sotong, kangkong, XO fried rice, sweet sour pork etc.
Portion is rather large.
May be a little pricey.
Staff are nice."
"They just raised their chicken rice take away from $4.80 to $5.00 last month.

Yesterday they are raising the price again to $5.50 for customers asking for breast meat.

By the way their menu on Grab food doesn't include rice and they charge an extra $2.00 per person for rice.

Such a rip off - from now I will boycott 5 star and go to Boon Tong Kee which is only next door and they charge take away at $4.25"
"Super delicious kampung chicken, even when delivered! Price is on the steep side but you get quality meats so it's worth it for me."
"Ordered two packs of the roast chicken and they were pretty good, and he chilli nicely complemented the meals.

We also ordered a Hainanese pork chop, but that was ordinary.  It was not even vinegary, and did not come with the usual tomato sauce with onions and peas."
Nice and tender chicken. Delivery is fast and good too.
"Chicken meat is tender ,rice is so nice ! The sauce blend they use complements the dish so well !  Price quite affordable with this quality ,Overall is good ."
"It says it in the restaurant name. This place does a satisfying chicken rice, with chicken that is not too fatty or oily, but tasty, tender, and juicy. They do a good fried rice too laced with wok hey, eggy fragrance, and fresh seafood."
I love the chicken here... Yummy.....
"loved it !
Roasted Chicken Rice is  awesome
nice and juicy."
One of my favourite family place for lunch
Standard dropped abit but still a nice place to have chicken rice.
The food taste average for chicken rice. No WOW factor or uniquness. The price is too high for this qualitybof chicken rice.
"$5.50 for a tiny plate of chicken meat only, chicken rice doesn't comes with rice, I have to pay $1 for rice. Overpriced."
Good chicken despite it being dinner
This restaurant will always guarantee you a satisfying chicken rice fix even at midnight. Fragrant rice and tender chicken meat with a shiok chilli sauce. Good thing as well that you can add other items (like a typical tze char stall) on top of the chicken rice.
Loved the food! Always the best
A bit ex on price.
"Liao Li Hao Chi,Fu Wu You Dian Gen Bu Shang!"
The kampung chicken was good but the fish was so so.
I like this place
"It is spicy chicken. So, not much to write about unless you are asking the true question, will an egg salad the grow up to be a chicken salad.
Well, the answer is no. This place does not sell egg salad and chicken salad."
Chicken rice sold in any hawker center beats their chicken rice hands down.  Totally unimpressed with their chicken rice.
"Saw a couple of top 10 chicken rice list and five star came in most of the list.

We decided to go there and give it a try.

Chicken rice set portion of chicken is small as well as rice. But the chicken was really nice and juicy and perfectly flavoured.

Rice was nicely cooked and had a good flavour of that chicken broth.

 to five star chicken rice"
 is moisturising soft so is the fresh chicken  ... Best of all things Staff are really helpful & courtesy 
Impressed to write up and eat at the same time. Succulent white chicken and fragrant rice.  Very dependable and a family favourite. Hope you like the article!
"Fantastic chicken rice. A chain, but this is an older one and great service from staff."
"Local chicken rice restaurant.

They are more like local Chinese restaurant and their chicken rice is famous.

They have chicken rice set menu only on weekends which comes with chicken, rice, veggies and drink.

I had mix white and roasted chicken and rice. The food potion was big enough for 2."
"Lovely place, the chicken rice set ranges from $11.90 to $13.90 depending on the side dish and you can top up $1 for drinks as well! Its gets quite busy during weekday lunch period due to the office lunch period. The staff were nice and friendly and able to juggle both Chinese and English well!"
"Always enjoyed the chicken rice here, not too oily and tastes authentic."
"Good taste, good variety. A little pricey but worth it"
Taste better than most Chicken Rice sold in Hawker centers. Portion was small though for the price paid.
It's been a decade n or more n it still taste the same... Two thumbs up for chicken rice..
Best Hainanese Chicken Rice in town! Can't bear this!
Chicken served cold.
Best chicken rice I have ever had in SG
Quite nice.
"Best place for chicken rice. Also try the no no cha cha.
Order the chicken rice. Mix the garlic ginger and soya sauce in the rice with the chili paste.
Also the beans and Kai lan  are awesome fried in garlic"
"HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED ! I ordered 2 pax of chicken rice from this place on foodpanda. God knows why is the chicken rice price separated from the chicken pricing. And no vegetables were included. A pathetic amount of chicken was provided. My total bill came up to $17. Previously, FiveStar would provide a bento set lookalike box with vegetables included for the same price. This is highly upsetting. Please review your marketing strategies. I will not be buying from this shop anymore ! What a waste of money !"
The portion slightly little for the price but otherwise its decent. Chili is good.
very expensive
"Though the 5* restuarant at East Coast Road known more for its Kampung Chicken Rice but on the contrary the 2 dishes that I always eat & crave for more is the Kungpao Chicken with Sweet Chillies & the Black Pepper Fish. These 2 dishes can be comparable with the best in the whole of Singapore.

Do try these 2 dishes for all those who are visiting this place for the 1st time."
our favorite chicken rice on the east coast
best chicken rice in town !!!
The 'white' chicken was velvety tender compared to the drier 'roast' chicken. Tofu was crispy on outside and silky inside. Long beans pan tossed with caipo and haebee had great wok-hei.
"Rude service by Helen (if I didn't remember correctly, it is the Filipino lady). Grumpy and looks unhappy."
One of my favorite chicken rice place since moving to SG
"Their specialty...chicken rice
"
Juciest braised chicken rice at Killiney Road
Great food ambience and service
The price is on a slightly higher end for chicken rice. But food portion and taste are good.
"Five Star rating is for their kampong chicken, they also offer other food varieties."
"Damage for lunch at Five Star : $40 for a full chicken, 4 rice and 1 portion of organs. Pretty pricey but the chicken is exceptionally flavourful. Slighty disconcerting to see the gallops of jellyish fats on the skin. Health freaks beware! Felt pretty thirsty after the meal too so caution for those who are worried about MSG."
Ordered roasted chicken for 1... was literally all bones. For $6.50 I can find better quality and quantity chicken rice
"I'm not sure whether it was the MSG that was in the chicken or the Kang Kong that we ordered, but all three of us experienced the same sort of dryness and irritation of our throats."
"Inflexible, bad service. No point of going there with soooo many amazing food options around"
"The absolute worst Chicken Rice I've had in Singapore. Peanuts were placed on the table as if complimentary. So overboiled were the peanuts that we didn't have more than 2 and they charge you for that. They even charge for the wet wipes without informing

The Chicken Rice was absolute dry and such a ridiculous portion. Also you're charged extra for the rice. Walk a few more metres and eat at the Katong Shopping Mall basement."
"Nice local food restaurant, with various options available. Absolutely falling in love in their chicken rice,whose taste is richer than other restaurants in Singapore. However, the rice set can be a little too small for some people like me,then I would recommend you to buy extra meat or rice. Don't forget to taste their pickle there."
Use too much single use plastic.
"Five Star Kampung Chicken Rice is amazing!
I like that they use Kampung Chicken, so the chicken contains less fats.
Would definitely recommend this place!
Do arrive early to avoid long waits!"
Very nice Singaporean food
Chicken rice +
"Convenient place, just along East Coast road. Staff friendly. They have roasted or white chicken. Both very tasty and juicy. They also have side dishes like veg, tofu, etc... Price quite reasonable. If compare to next door Boon Tong Kee, I prefer 5 Star. Boon Tong Kee will try to sell you more expensive chicken parts and other dishes even if you are alone."
"Come here for the chicken rice experience of homely soup, tangy cured cucumber and fragrant rice."
Tastes like any ordinary chicken rice you can get around Singapore
Excellent meal
The food was fantastic
Good chicken rice but also sold here are seafood like chilli crab and many more Chinese dishes. Takeaway and drive thru available here as well.
"I though it was a joke. The portion of their steamed Kampung chicken for 5.50$ was super small even they tried to make it bigger putting a cucumber underneath. Plain rice another 1$. And the Lemongrass drink for 2$, that was brought with fingers almost in the drink itself, was so plain enough to leave it. All plastic, even the drink cup. Service was fast. The close-by restaurants were much better."
The food is okay but I don't think it's worth the price. Half chicken + 2 bowls of chicken rice = $20 
"The chicken to rice ratio here is way too pathetic. A big name but it seems to have lost the passion in honest, good food.
If you want a good chicken rice you are better of at Wee Nam Kee."
decent quality Singapore style chicken rice at slightly higher prices.
Not as delicious as before
"For me, here is the place for chicken rice!! Yummy"
"Not bad, worth trying!"
Our favorite chicken rice in Marine Parade. The chicken they use are better than in most places and they do their fragrant rice well. I also like that when you take away food they would fill and pass you a bucket of clear soup for free I you ask for it.
This is a great chicken rice place. The chicken is healthier than many other options. And what's nice is the other dishes are quite good as well. If you are in the neighborhood you can do a lot worse than here. They take credit cards and grab pay. And you can sit either inside our outside. Service is pleasant and for Singapore a huge plus is decent priced beer. Large beer S$7. It's a good middle ground between a hawker market and a restaurant. Highly recommend.
Chicken rice is nice. The tofu and vegetable is OK only
"Food was average and price was okay - no real complaints there. However one thing that bugged me was that there was a charge for peanuts that was handed to us without a word, and wet napkins that were sitting on the table. I don't care about the couple of bucks, but the idea of being tricked/forced into paying for something without mention is unsettling."
Lovely chicken rice and desserts
high cost performance.

"Using kampong chicken really makes this stand out from the rest of the chicken rice stalls
Juicy and tasty meat"
Food was delicious except for the dessert. The dessert was below expectation especially the Bubur Chacha.
"Was told this serves great chicken rice. Unfortunately, I'm not impressed. Come to KL and many normal eateries serve better ones."
"Dorogo, zharyat na sale"
The chicken rice here is indeed awesome but I have to give a shout out to the incredible char siu. The chicken is nice and lean without the greasy feel that some places have so the meat has a firm but soft texture. This is a great place to take friends for something a bit above the hawker center style and even more delicious.
Great food. Do resos if you want a spot and you can ask for indoors with air con! Definitely order the chicken! You can get a whole one half roasted and half regular. The cereal fried shrimp were also really delish.
"Black pepper fish and sea food fried is my thing here....its jus amazing..
Guys pls dont have those sumkinda peanuts they get on table...they charge u for dat...they get and keep it on table as if its complimentary den charge you .."
A staple for us. Good food all around
One of the best Roasted Chicken Rice place I've been too.
Best chicken rice in Singapore and maybe even the best in the world
Been here a couple of times in these few months. The chicken is really good!
Awesome place best chicken in Singapore
Pales in comparison to Delicious Boneless Chicken Rice and Boon Tong Kee. The steamed chicken has gelatin jelly under the skin and sauce aren't as good.
Nice sumptuous chicken rice
Food is very good however quantity is little for the price
"Chicken was cold, with really yellow fatty skin that looked unappetising. The other dishes were actually better than their chicken rice. Wouldn't be in a hurry to go back honestly. Katong shopping center has way better chicken rice."
"One of the best chicken rice in Singapore. The kampong chicken taste is very good. And the homemade tofu, also the vegetable taste very nice too."
"One of the best chicken rice in town, a succulent chicken meat. Others menu worth to try too."
"Needless to say, best chicken rice in Singapore. 10/10"
Standard fares - nothing to shout about ....
All time favorite. Not been for back for years... Must say I miss the old style and the boss. Modernize to keep with times I guess.
Food was good just that the sauce was lacking despite asking for more sauce from the start
"The chicken is good, but everything else is salty and there is msg in it. After eating, I felt super thirsty."
Taste of Singapore. Must try.
"Choice between eating alfresco or in air conditioned comfort, long operating hours, nice food though a bit on the high side."
One of my more prefer choice for chicken rice.
Nice place
Best chicken rice. Their chilli is a killer! Love it!
Steamed chicken with the special sauce is great
Good chicken rice with variety of zhi char available
Great chicken rice here at Katong area! The chicken was super soft and delicious! Right now they have a $5 DASH promotion for a set of chicken rice and that is so worth it! Service here is also very good and very fast! Therefore I would really recommend this place for chicken rice!
Amazing chicken! Oiled rice was delicious!
"Had lunch and order tze dishes.
Chicken rice well cooked - was fragrant and not oily. The white chicken was tender. The rest of the dishes were quite alright."
"Expensive chicken rice not as good as the hype. But the Hor Fun with egg gravy is a ""must try"", quite tasty."
Good food ahould be praised and made known.

Singapore Chicken and Rice at its finest!
Good chicken rice
"I think $4.50 for so miserable share
.unjustifiable. "
They had a good services
"WORST EVER Customer Service at East Coast Road outlet. I've been patronising Five Stars for years even when a competitor opened shop a few doors down. I had a bad experience this evening with a service staff who was horribly rude and impatient.

There was literally no crowd, no customers at all, but she was impatient and kept hurrying us. When I came out from the washroom with my daughter and thought my packed food on the counter, she physically shoved me aside and said mine isn't ready. Could have nicely told me so, again what's the hurry. This on top of her being extremely rude from the very start of the order.

This experience has ended my relationship with Five Stars. They obviously do not care about their customer base. You'll be better off somewhere else."
My favourite chicken rice restaurant.
Huan Bu Cuo
Where the locals go for classic chicken rice. Hawker ambiance.
Hao Chi De Shan Ba Ji Fan
Used to sell only steamed chicken. Now serves various restaurant type dishes. Chicken rice is excellent. Better than the bigger names.
"My favorite chicken rice joint in all of Singapore. I come here every time I visit. Skinless, boneless steamed is my goto and I make sure to get the chicken soup with it as well which is just top notch. Also, dont miss the crispy? Shrimp thing that was glorious."
Had porridge which was watery...
Decent chicken rice but not a standout in my opinion. Some of the other dishes were quite good. It's a little pricey overall
Ordered chicken rice and other dishes. Reasonable priced and good place for families and friends.
Good chicken rice.
Everything is great. -1 star because not much beverage options.
good steak
Delicious local Hainan style chicken rice
"Meh, overpriced chicken rice "
It's alright. Nothing to wow about
"As always,  very good food"
"A pack of chicken rice that cost $4.50 + $1 ( egg) , you basically just eat the rice because the chicken pieces are thin and small, I think it's for the serving of toddler. I came here to eat chicken rice not "" rice only "" , luckily I paid extra for an egg. They didn't  even give ginger for take away?   Never mind, there are many chicken rice stalls on EC Rd, don't have to revisit them"
Recommended dish: chicken
17 bucks for half chicken. Have to walk a while from Katong Villiage to reach here.
Chicken not so good any more. Sauce taste is on the sweet side
They seem to not know how to chop a chicken. Every single time I eat there I have to pick the shattered bones that are in millions of pieces out of my food and rice. It's nice but I really hate the way they smash the bone into splinters. Becareful when you eat. Don't say I didn't warn you.
Great Chicken Rice
Love their newer menu with wider variety and yummy options.
Good taste but pricy!
Had a delicious Singapore fried rice 
Great taste Hainanese chicken rice deli at SG
Great food
"Recommended to come here by a local Singaporean so unless you know the place, you don't know what you miss. The Hainan Chicken Rice was very good. The waiter however forgot one dish, we only ordered three dishes so a bit disappointed for service. Price is very reasonable. This place is mostly attended by locals so ambience is good."
This place is open till late and it serves the best chicken rice in the east coast area. Even other food served is good.
"This place crowded every dinner time. Beside the best seller Steam Chicken, Bitter Gourd Soup really taste good, refreshing and healthy. Fragrance Hainan Rice also delicious. Not difficult to find actually.. It just crowded, so if you really starving after work better prepare. Too starving forgot to take food pictures hahaha"
Not bad. Have had better tho.
Tasty Chicken Rice.
No water to drink.
"Wide variety of local favourites but the stars (all five of them) are the Kampung Chicken, either white or roasted. This is a place that I don't hesitate taking overseas clients as well as my own family to."
"The restaurant is not up to the expectation. The chicken has a bit rubbery texture, even the drumstick does not have much meat. The chili sauce is nice. The lime juice is the usual powder-made overly sugary nonsense. The service is not too great either. They asked something about the plate of peanut in Chinese that we did not understand (we had not touched the peanut, nor the wet tissue) but my wife said we did not eat from it in English. However, when I was paying, both the peanut and the wet tissues were on the bill. I don't understand why any restaurant in Singapore needs to use these little tricks to get some extra money."
Good food but lots of guest.
"Good chicken rice, busy place frequented by locals."
Must say the chicken rice is not what it used to be some years back. Staff service is great here simply because there are hardly many customers here these days.
Delicious  chicken rice....must try.
It was excellent overall. The chicken is very tender and the braised tofu was excellent.
Chick rice is normal and this restaurant server other variety food.
average food and expensive
"I have to say, the chicken here is very average. Me and friend don't feel it's any better than food court stalls."
"The chicken rice is really tasty, even better than Boon Tong Kee next door. One problem here is the parking. Unless you are not driving here, or you'll have a parking problem."
"Real good chicken rice, worth the try."
Nice place to have a good lunch. 
Probably one of the most delicious chicken rice in singapore. Ordering a whole or half chicken is mote worth it than ordering individual portions.
Great chicken rice.
If u love chicken this has to be the place!!
"Good food, good service, good time."
Great not oily chicken rice. The one in east coast is much better than the one in river valley

"Don't let the name cheat you, it's a 3* restaurant, haha. However, at this price, you can't expect much more. About $30 for two pax, with one drink.

We ordered salted egg pork, chicken feet skin, and some fried rice. The fried rice was great, along with the chicken feet skin. The salted egg pork was regular, similar to what you'd find elsewhere.

Barley was too watered down, and they tried to ding us on the peanuts, once by serving it to us instantly (we rejected), and the second time by tacking it onto our bill. Also, what the touts outside lured us in with wasn't available (the chicken set). I don't think I'll come back here again."
Very nice chicken rice and other local dishes
"One of Singapore's best! Choose outside seating and you'll eat just like locals do. Tried their Singaporean Chilli Crab, it's so tasty and delicious. You can request the spiciness of your chilli crab. Best paired with 'Mantou' (fried bun). Also tried their Chicken Rice and some Veggies and they all taste very nice."
Good for chicken rice & charshu rice!!!
I always prefer them over boon tong Kee. I find their chicken is more tender but my last visit is disappointing because they are no longer a place that just serve chicken rice and price has gone up since my last visit. Their portion isn't really huge. Well kumpong chicken ain't big to begin with.
Good chicken rice
Very good chicken rice at reasonable price
"Five Star chicken rice has indoor and alfresco seating. On this day I first went to Boon Tong Kee and five star is my second stop. Chicken, while comparable to boon tong kee, comes at a more affordable price point. Their chicken cuts (ordered chicken breast) are relatively thinner, and it soaks up more of the chicken gravy. Rice is less fragrant than BTK, but is more generous."
"Taste good, but the price is a little high."
"Had the Chicken Rice.  Taste = 4.5 stars, but not enough chicken and too much rice.  Hence giving 4 stars.  Good service."
Worms in  vegetable
The food taste abit different from last time... i don't know what it is but it just taste different from last time
"Parking is limited and it is best you park inside the building where Spizza is (just ahead of the road). Once u get that settled, everything else is worth it. Five stars still has the best kampung chicken I've tried among many. Love that jelly like stuff it produced from the Bai Qie Ji (white steam chicken). Besides Chicken, there are many other dishes too! U have to try their fried baby squid which is especially crispy. Service wise, just don't hope. Go for the food, you are safe."
"Staff was nice and responsive. Food was good, chicken could be a little softer."
"Very good chicken rice, price is reasonable as well cknsidering its brand name."
Kung po chicken tastes like recycled wood and staff wouldn't replace or remove from our bill.  Very poor customer service.
Literally 5 stars. Love their chicken.
the best chicken rice in singapore
"Fine Star Kampung Chicken is probably the best chicken rice place in Katong, in my opinion. The crowd that beats all the other places seem to me many others agree with me. 
Oh, but there is another outlet in Parkway Parade that sells soy sauce chicken which I like better, but that's beside the point... this place has kampung chicken that is as succulent as fat battery chickens sold by others.
I wouldn't be able to comment about their other offerings, as I never get to try anything else... that's how good is their chicken.
This place isn't very wheelchair and stroller friendly unless you would consider sitting outside... seating is very closely packed on account of how narrow the shop is."
"Saw a few cockroaches on the floor, one climbed onto my legs :') chicken rice was so so, too salty. Far from five stars... there's boon tong kee just a few shops away which is so much better"
Great place
"Rude and ill mannered staff, asked for extra chili and was given one, spoke to the manager and got an indifferent response. Being a dedicated fan of this place and it's food now will never visit this place. Disappointed at their behavior."
"Great food, very cheap and quick service."
"Hai Nan Ji Fan Bi Tian Tian Hao Yi Dian,Yi Kai Shi Hui Zhi Jie Song Shi Zhi Jin Gen Tu Dou(You Suan Qian De,Qiang Po Tui Xiao De Gan Jue),Suo Yi Yao Zhu Yi"
The white and roasted chicken are too salty or sweet. You can get a decent meal here. I am neutral on this five star hainanese chicken rice outlet at tanjong katong branch
A sober place for dinner
"Chickens are soft, slightly sweet, and not dry. The white chicken is a bit too cold for me, but the roasted chicken reminds me of what I ate in Hong Kong. The rice needs to be separately ordered, it's a bit dry and hard. The sauces, esp the chilly one, are really authentic and thick."
"Filipino server on 29th April's night wrote our order and misplaced it, causing us to wait an hour for our food."
It used to be the best hainanese chicken rice in town but my previous visit back in December the taste is below my expectation. But it still one of my favourite dishes in Singapore
"23.04.2018: i come back again after the long flight, i would only recommend the chicken rice and white chicken coz the roasted chicken is quite over cooked, i had the mixed and matched half chicken plus rice, i think it's better than having the dinner set given these 2 items are their best..

02.04.2018: better than average Hainanese Chicken Rice, i had the late lunch, said 1.00 pm, so no queue at all, the chicken rice was the main and chicken was the side, given said that the rice was full of chicken broth favor but not oily at all like some other places, amazing that it looked like white rice :)"
Delicious and affordable with a nice service.
"Roast chicken is horrible, go to the coffee shop slightly further down the road for way better and cheaper roast chicken. Regular chicken also not very tender, the chili sauce is pretty much the best thing. Not worth a second visit."
"Simple, cheap and fast, good taste."
Best chicken rice ever
Food is good but very expensive. For 2 person a small vegetable and cups of drinks cost  $35.
"The food is very nice..
The down side was they gave us the herbal nuts.. We thought it's for free.. (we didn't order it)..
In the end, they charged us.."
"We just here to have the white chicken rice and no other things, the staff seem like not welcome as we eat only chicken rice cause when we eat half way, the staff just took away the chilli sauce, ginger sauce and black soya sauce to another empty table. I feel that maybe we just only have chicken rice with no other order and that's why they took away. I think we have to order more then maybe we will get better services."
Chicken rice and fried toufu
Chicken is tender.
Good chicken rice
Very good chicken rice
"This is the place where I go to, to get my chicken rice fix"
"Their salted egg pork ribs is a must try dish! Very flavorful and the pork is cooked just right. Their rice looks savoury and taste good. Try adding their dark soy sauce on your rice, enhances the flavor. Chicken is satisfactory. Can give the Hotplate tofu a miss though. Service is good, they will inform you when the parking attendant comes. "
The chicken rice was very good
Chicken taste good!
Famous restaurant in the neighborhood.
Subpar compared to boon tong kee. Chendol is lousy.
Very little rice given even though they charged $1 for it. Taste was so so. Staff service very curt. Not friendly. Gives you the feeling that they just want to quickly get on with their job.
The food is relatively cheap and tasted great. The Chinese uncle is super friendly.
I like this restaurant.
Good as the neighbours!
"Kou Wei Ke,Shi Nei Zuo Wei You Kong Diao,Dan Shen Ye Bu Kai Fang Shi Nei Zuo Wei"
Goodchicken rice
"Dishes were great. Rice was a little bland, but still delicious. Chili was the icing for the dish."
"Good food, cheap pricing. Boon Tong Kee has better chicken in Bendemeer"
"Ordered 4 dishes, so so in taste."
Certainly nowhere near 5 stars for its chicken rice.  Above average at best.
Great chicken rice.
"My favorite late night dinner place. The food (both chicken and vegetables) are done really well here, and you have a choice of porridge or rice!"
Decent chicken rice (pricier than regular hawker Centres) and range of cooked dishes.
Eat where the locals eat!  Great food and very well priced. They thought I was John Rambo.  Great service too
Great food... Chicken rice might be standard but at least it's consistent
"Jiu Can Huan Jing Yi Ban,Ji Rou De Jiang Zhi Tian Tian De,Bu Tai Hao Chi,Ling Wai Qi Ta Di Fang 45Xin Yuan De Pang Xie Zhe Li Mai Qi Shi Xin Yuan,Bu Tui Jian"
No so friendly
"Staff were courteous, friendly and efficient. Chicken and omelet was good."
"Wo Jiu Shi Guan Guang Ke,Chong Man Xin Qi. Wo Gei Yu Ta Wu Xing Ping Jia,Yin Zai Jia Ge Yu Liao Li Du You Xiang Dang Gao De CPZhi. Bing Qie Shi Wo Chi Guo Jiu Jian Hai Nan Ji Fan Li Pai Ming Di Er De"
"Good chicken rice chain stall which is located next to another rival, Boon Tong Kee. Offers both roasted and steamed chicken along with the zi char (stir fried) cuisine to complement the chicken rice. Parking may be an issue especially during dinner hours."
Delicious Hainanese Chicken.
Yummy Chicken Rice !!
Nice chicken rice.  $6 per pack for rice with drumstick.
Can eat if you are around.
Quick service. Wonderful and tasty food. Best on East Coast.
Lovely cuisine
"Your typically chicken rice cum zhi Char place, same as Boon Tong Kee down the road and tastes just as good!"
"Good chicken rice, crowd is alright, pricey but worth it"
The chicken rice and teochew porridge are really good.
Upgraded to take orders. GOOD food overall. Staff fill up beer and good lime juice.
Good food and service. Chilli is really hot and spicy
"Food is good, but slightly overpriced for a chicken rice stall."
"Ru Guo Ni Xi Huan Zhong Shi Xiao Cai,Zhe Li Ke Yi Man Zu Ni. "
"Good chicken rice, nice chili"
"Casual
Good food"
"Fan Xiang Rou Nen,Pei Wo Di Di Lian Xu 3Tian Qu Chi"
Alright food but it's pretty expensive.
"Great chicken, prices are reasonable"
Reasonable price. Delicious chicken
Good chicken rice.. Probably 2nd best after tian tian
Simply yummy ... The choice and the taste of the cuisine offered is fantastic .... Must try .
Good enough for people who love chicken rice around Katong. Price little bit high.
"Not Bad But Not Five Star Either

Down to earth no frills Singaporean cuisine with several branches around Singapore.

Try:
Five Star Kampong Chicken
Homemade Tofu

Okay:
Cereal Sotong
Baby Kailan with Garlic

IG: eatsmorefun"
Great food. This my go to place for chicken rice.
I prefer the other one at katong shopping centre.
Very nice chicken rice!Good environment for this price!
"slightly above average chicken rice,  with a good selection of seafood and chinese style dishes.

Parking availability is horrible though, so be prepared to make a few rounds in the area before getting a lot.

Don't bother with the desserts though...... Mango Sago I ordered was just watery.... Ugh.."
Decent choice if you can't afford Boon Tong Kit down the road.
"Even though it's just a 2 min walk away from where I stay, I don't frequent this eatery as much as Mei Yuen and Sin Hoi Sai. The chicken rice is so-so, not great. If you are in need of a quick take-away meal, this is it."
Good chicken rice. Also lots of zhichar options
Very decent chicken rice. Mostly outdoor sitting.
"Classic Singaporean food. Tasty, affordable and open until late."
"$8 for a very good meal, soup,chicken and rice with a lime juice drink as well as spice dip mixed by a very nice lady. It was good food at a great price."
"The food here is seriously expensive. Altuough it has a good service but the food quality does not worth the high price labelled. They not only sell chicken rice but they also has seafood. However, compared to sin hoi sai eating house next door, i prefer sin hoi sai's seafood."
Chicken wasn't as tender as I expected. Side dishes were over prepared. Staff was not enthusiastic.
xcellent. value for money.
"Taste was ok but leaning towards saltier side. Female counter staff was rude . I informed previously that I was dining in. But when she repeated my orders later, she complained that I was the one wrongly informing that I was taking away my order. When giving me the number tag, she threw it roughly on the counter."
Chee Cheong Fun skin lack of the smoothness texture. Chee Cheong Fun is priced at $3/each
"This is the new menu, king crab meat, no that great compare with the traditional char siew favour, no recommend to try.

Besides, the lady boss attitude no so great, forgot to give me chilli, return and request for it, still complains that I need to request it in advance. Somemore she just threw the plate after putting in the chilli.

I think I will not visit this stall in future due to lady boss attitude issue"
Craving of HK style Chee Cheong fun satisfied. Will buy again for sure.
"not bad, buy it because there's no queue."
Average food with bad service (even by hawker center standard) from the rude lady staff.
"First time trying this stall. Couldn't decide between white or black carrot cake.   Boss said white more popular so I went with his suggestion.   No regrets.  Nice.  Didn't from usual white carrot cake,  he sprinkled cai po on it.  Helped to elevate the overall taste."
Don't know how come the Chee Cheong Fun was rather coool. 
Ordered char siew chee cheong fun. Not bad. Served hot and cheap at $3. But sauce a bit too little.
"Very bad service, told the owner mushroom and prawn for 2 times but gave us char siew and prawn. Requested for a change but stubbornly insisted that our order was correct."
The only store that egg is added to Zhu chang fen. Nice source and volume is fine
"food is delicious, although owners seemed to not give chilli now even when requested, saying that it does not taste good when paired when their chee chong fun .....weird"
Managed to get a last order in at 12:30pm on a Sat... Wow! Not disappointd - ordered the Century Egg ZCF....
Owner close for a month and did not update Google.
"It's silky smooth cheong fun and consider each is $2.50 (prawn & char siew) the ingredient is quite decent. As it's freshly made upon order, please allow at least 10 minutes if cooking time for them to prepared. Takeaway still taste ok after reheat with microwave. I think it would taste better if you eat on the spot."
Good traditional style
"Freshly made chee cheong fun with a piquant chilli which elevates the sauce further. The skin was silky smooth and very thin, and the filings were generous and seasoned just right. There were many options and we decided to try the standard char siew one, as well as something not so common - chai poh filling. Both were equally good. Worth a try if you happen to be in the area!"
"I have been to tis marsiling mall for a few times, over here there is a lot of food to eat, each time I pass by tis stall alway a long Q, today at around 1.30pm like tat, i saw not much people's, so I decided to give it a try, i saw the sign board light is turn off, so I walk near the stall & ask tat aunty still operating, tat aunty was so..... rude she ans me back, dun disturb me, I m counting something, wat kind of attitude is this, at least u should just tell me off, wait a while i m counting something"
Same branding as the famous old airport road stall. The rice noodle roll standard is just as good. Very yummy.
Highly recommend this stall at Marsiling Mall!! Everything on their menu is so good and delicious. Best chee cheong fun and carrot cake I've tasted!
"Tasted this for the first time in 6 months!!! My friend and I would always frequent this place after running at the stadium and sadly it has been closed every time we came after CB :( but it's open again!!!

Haven't had my regular fix of chee cheong fun and carrot cake in ages and my craving is finally satisfied :)))

HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend!!!! The auntie and uncle r nice too"
"Surprisingly good soup, I bought the lotus soup.  Friendly uncle"
"Hawker is very kind, gave extra meatball when ordering pork rib soup and extra pork when ordered meatball soup. Extra rice also. Portion is definitely not stingy."
"This stall doesn't seem to sell anything on their signboard. I have tried more than once to order something from the stall, only to have the man waved his hand to shoo me away as if I ordered something ridiculous! This guy is next level rude.  If you do not want to spoil your day, avoid going near this stall."
"Very sweet soup at affordable prices. I've tried the white carrot pork rib soup $4.50. Stall owner is very friendly, he gave me a free meatball to try "
The quantity is so little with price I paid....cannot buy next time.
Fu Jia Japanese and Korean Cuisine offers value for money dining experience with its wide range of options. Highly recommended for anyone looking for Japanese and Korean flavors in Woodlands. 
"ordered mixed Veg rice on 7Jul.  decided to reject one of the dishes, the staff started to speak vulgar language and stare at me! what kind of service is that! Horrible experience from this food stall!"
Very wide spread of dishes . Taste wise mediocre.
5/5 cai png. Affordably priced - 3 veg 1 meat for $4.60. Food is good and the young men running the stall are enthusiastic and passionate about their work. Been here a few times and always had excellent food.
"Delicious brothy pig organ soup. Portion size was okay for the pricing, but the soup itself is flavourful."
"Soup was very flavourful with lots of fresh ingredients. Queue moved fast, pricing was reasonable too."
"Highly recommend this flavourful soup packed with generous portion of tender and lean pork slices, tofu and crunchy preserved vegetables for S$5.00, plus add a bowl of fragrant rice cooked to perfection for S$0.50. Love the variety of sauces to spice up the taste. Even those who don't fancy eating pork, should give it a try. You might just come back for more, just like me. 

The stall owners are very friendly and thoughtful too. I ordered one slice pork soup and used my container for takeaway. He packed the container using an extra plastic bag, as the container cover was not very tight.  for the great customer service! "
"Delicious meal! Pig trotter with rice is amazing. Portion is huge,
Meat is tender. Staff was polite. Added large intestine and it was amazing! Will be back again"
This is a classic find. I ate and loved kuay chap since 30 years ago and have been craving this exact taste and serving. it's a very Singaporean aged taste and Chilli tastes exactly like 30 years ago! In fact everything they make tastes exactly like I remembered 30 years ago! And these are not old looking bunch of owners too. It's not Malaysian style.. it's not herbal style.. it's simply Singaporean in it's original flavor. Best part is that they do not hold back their sauces or portions inflation or not. Their soups and meat are the real deal! I hate to get long queues but I would hate it more if they closed because no one else knew.
"When wecwalked past the stall, there was strong smell so we actually wanted to pass on eating at this stall. However. Due to good reviews, we decided to give it a try. We were not disappointed. All the ingredients were properly cleaned and cooked and were really sumptuous. I like the kway chap noodle which was a little chewy. The gravy and the salted vegetables were also very tasty. Will try other dishes the next time I come here."

"Excellent! Innards are cleaned properly with no foul smell.
Pig organ soup is good too."
wow. i was surprised the set 3 Braised pig troter is this good. the soup/sauce is nice. I think it is better than song fa. need to eat rice plus the sauce is very yummy. I stay in bedok. but will come again to eat this set 3.
"Affordable price, average taste. Quantity is probably just right for most people. Have yet to try out other menu items."
"Fresh and Tasy Pig organ soup. Portion is reasonable for $5. Rice at 50cents. Worth a try.

Staff is generally friendly. Service can b faster though.
Expect at least 10 to 15mins Q time on wkend and PH.

But Sadly Marsiling Hawker Center is a V warm and stuffy place... so b prepared."
"Very delicious! A family business with loving home cook taste, plus point is the chef is quite handsome "
"Quite decent . Pig stomach soup with pig kidney add on .

Though pig stomach some of the slices have a lil porky smell . Pig kidney is alright .

Service ok ."
"Nice , appetising, long q on monday
Owners seems to have changed
Taste wise about there for pig organ soup"
Both pig organ soup and bak kut the soup are tasty and good value for money. Nice fluffy rice @$0.50.
"Delicious pig stomach with sourish salted vegetables and spring onion plus rice. Total $6.00. Ample clean pig stomach for the price, yummy! Thumbs-up!"
"Order their liver and kidney Mee sua for $6.

It was simple nice but nothing to wow about. Meat was slightly under cooked when I got it, so soaked it up for a while before consumption.

Soup was very peppery. While it is up by alley I feel that it shouldn't let it define the dish as this ended up to be a bit one dimensional.

Sure the exotic taste of kidney and liver is there but this make it like a typical organ soup (which falls under above average taste since it is flavorful). The mee sua is just like average mee sua, doesn't have any Al dente feel to it."
You gotta try this if you are nearby. Love their pig organ soup and kway chap!
I love the pig organ soup here. Especially the Lu Zhu Jiao that really have lot of meat. I usually ordered Lu Zhu Jiao add Zhu Da Chang. Lovely combination for me and the sauce was very flavorful when pour onto rice. Cannot say much about the atmosphere as it is at marsling mall hawker center but the ventilation is good.
"My family enjoyed the food. The serving size was pretty good. Can add on ingredient or upsize with cost, just need to ask."
"It's usually a busy stall. I think it's a family run business whereby they also clear their queue fairly quick. Ordered pig organ soup and kway. The brown soup matches their soft kuey (I think their kway chap will taste better too - maybe try next time). The pig's organ soup ingredients are fresh and no piggy smell. I think the portion also generous and topped with generous amount of coriander and chives makes it more appetizing. Soup taste is up to the notches with flavor and not too overwhelming. I would say it's a pretty decent bowl of pig's organ soup you can find in the north. Shall try their kway chap next.
Updates with kuey chap & bak kut teh
Bak Kut Teh meat portion is quite generous the soup also not too peppery. It's the best thing to have on a rainy day. As for the Kway Chap, it's ok to try."
"When queuing to order, I can smell the waft of aromatic spices that they used to marinate and braised the meat. Ordered the kway chap set for one person without the kway. Very happy with the purchase. The portion is big, the intestines were chewy, the braised meat tender and everything is flavorful. Next should try the braised pig trotters too. Look appetizing."
"I was looking for Zhu Shi Tang (Pig's Organ Soup) and found this at Marsiling Mall. Turned out to be really good. The soup taste just right for my preference, plenty of ingredients, and the rice served is of good quality. All these plus a very reasonable price. Will definitely go back again. There are many other stalls that I hope to try as well, seeing the queues in front of them.

Although called Marsiling Mall, the car multi storey carpark charged HDB rates."
Affordable and nice soup and food. The owners are very friendly
Kway Chap the best! Serving is  for 4people. Long que sometimes. Must try if you are in this area.
Took away kway chup from the stall. The sauce was flavourful and thick. Portion size was good for the price. Would definitely come back to eat again!
"Had the pig's trotter, taste is good and the meat falls off the bone! Not vinegary."

"Simply the best . Fish head was fresh and steamed to perfection !
Smooth and tender meat ."
Big portion and super tasty. The lady who runs the place is very friendly and made me feel at home.
Ordered the Nonya Black Grouper ($25) and it was really tasty. The assam spice was just right and went well with the sweet and sour flavors. The fish was fresh too. Will be back to try other dishes!
"A simple and comforting dish that I grew up eating. The coarsely chopped patty has a good mixture of fatty and lean meat with springy texture.  the generous bits of salted fish that is mixed into the patty with additional fried salted fish sprinkled on top, to enhance the taste of it in every bite!"
Food is cooked quite well. Love the Minced pork tofu but they keep making mistakes with the orders. They get confused between bean curd and green beans or tripe and tendon. It's a pity. The dishes sound promising but can't really taste if they confuse the orders do many times.
$25 for a steamed pomfret - fish was fresh! simple kailan and fried egg omelette -- made for a cosy dinner :)
"Delicious Tze char, the steam fish and pork plate was homely and fresh. While the fried oil was not oily yet flavourful."
"Fish head was fresh, dishes were decent portions for their prices!"
"Been here multiple times already and their fish heads are always the freshest. Truly some of the best fish head ive eaten, the body flesh is so fresh and does not have a fishy taste at all, and the gelatinous jelly that fish head lovers love is in abundance in the fish head dishes. All are nice but my favourite is the HK one.

The side dishes are sometimes not as consistent but from what ive had, here are some thoughts:
- sotong is not the best, slightly chewy and too spicy
- caipo omelette was not seasoned
- prawn paste fried chicken was delicious and well marinated, but pieces were abit small in size
- kang kong is always cooked well and crunchy"
The worst hk style steamed promfret fish. Fried veggie soso ....
Love the steam fish head. Fresh and smooth. Sauce is nice too.
"Wifey an I came here on Sunday night and were pleasantly surprised by the tasty and very fresh ""special sauce steamed fish head"" served by Fu Xing Mei Shi. Usually I am very picky regarding fresh fish, but this one was great. We also had the Garlic Kai Lan which was equally delicious. Highly recommended."
Mei Wei Ke Kou Xian Dan Gua Zhong Jie Ge He Li
The steam soup is $4 and delicious!!!!!!!!!
"Nyonya styled steamed fish was really good. The meat was cooked just nice and the nyonya sauce was not that sour but tasty.
The steamed minced pork with salted fish was nice. Lots of salted fish.  Potato leaves in sambal was good too."
"The light assam flavored Nonya steamed fish head was fresh, super delicate and very appetizing. Goes well with the veggies. Shiok.

Back again for the Assam fish head and dragon chives. Shiok.

Back again for Hong Kong style steamed fish head and French beans with dried shrimp. Shiok.

Back again. Amazing steamed fish and dragon chives with QQ rice. Super shiok."
Would give 10 stars if i could. Fish was soooo tender.
"Updated
Our go to Zhi Char in Joo Chiat. Excellent flavour great value   30-45 min wait during busy time Go there early you won't be disappointed.

Fantastic flavour and a great price. The steamed pork with salted egg, bitter gourd omelette, claypot brinjal, fresh fish. All our favourites.  The double boiled soup are all a fantastic bargain too"
"Tried the steam fish head, 20 dollars for a huge serving that can be shared by 3-4, fish tastes smooth and fresh, sauce is not so salty."
"The fish head is cheap , fresh and delicious. Can come again"
Seriously good home comfort food in hawker centre setting. Portion is big .
"Steamed Fish Head: The star of the show! The special sauce steamed fish head is both savory and spicy, with fresh fish meat. The steaming process achieves the perfect doneness, retaining the natural freshness, texture, and moisture of the fish. You can choose from two other flavors: black bean sauce and nonya style.

Beyond fish head, the stall also serves delicious Chinese soups. Take your pick from options like watercress pork ribs soup, lotus root pork ribs soup, old cucumber pork ribs soup, and herbal black chicken soup.

To complete your meal, consider ordering other zi char favorites like claypot brinjal, prawn paste chicken wing, and sambal sweet potato leaves. Don't miss out on the steamed pork rib with black bean sauce as well!

Next time you're at Dunman Food Centre, be sure to check out this stall for a delightful culinary experience!"
I tried all their fish dishes but my favourite is still their Hong Kong style soy sauce steamed fish.
"Steam groupa Hk style, the fish is fresh and tasty, cook just right and texture is superb. The fried sweet potatoes leave is also lovely while the fried onion egg is a little too oily
Overall food is good, will come back to this hawker center again"
"The fish is big, fresh and tasty. The best part is that they don't hard sell. Auntie is very friendly."
Nonya Steamed Fish Head was amazing. The fish was nice and fluffy. The sauce was more sour than spicy which I loved. Only thing was that we asked for the Sambal Kang Kong to be less spicy but came out proper spicy anyways.
Fish is fresh AF
"Ordered the black bean sauce fish. It was fresh and well cooked. Do beware this fish has a lot of bones, need to be extra careful when consuming. Vegetable and prawn paste chicken is good and served hot ! Will be back to try more dishes."
"Fantastic steamed fish, great sauce Cantonese style and fresh fish. Can't go wrong. Vegetables are pretty ok as well, but fish is definitely one of the best in Singapore. Restaurants can't even compete."
Steam fish for the masses. Absolutely delicious!
Yucky food... pui 
"OMG! The food is . Ordered a fish head $20/-, Eggplant $8/-, and Omelette Egg $6/-. Egg is super salty, fish sauce is  and eggplant is tasteless.

The store are insulting the words ""Mei Shi"".

I will only use 6 Chinese words to describe their ""Mei Shi""... Shi Zai Tai Nan Chi Liao!

Not recommended even there's no other store open."

"We had the steamed chicken, steamed minced pork with salted fish, prawn omelette and garlic fried baby kailan, as we had just recovered from a sore throat.

Food was very good! Not too salty or oily.
Prawns and veg were fresh. Had the nice home cooked feel. Reminds me of grandma's cooking!

Definitely going back to try the other dishes!"
Standard dropped over the years. Sad. Egg no more flavour. Still edible.
Good affordable fish in different sauces. Other dishes taste good as well. Been patronizing this place for a number of years and standard remains top-notch. Waiting time can be long so best to come earlier.
Food is good and price is amazing too!
The vegetables and prawn paste chicken was good
"2nd floor of the food center, they have moved to the front row of stalls. Still prefer this one to the other one at the back near the wanton mee. The omelette with radish and Qing Long Cai are also really good.

The special sauce for the fish head can be a bit spicy. The bean sauce is always good and reliable."
Yummy good at decent prices. I always tapao as it's quite hard to find seats there n long waiting time esp after 6pm. The lady boss is friendly n efficient. But the young chap recently taking orders is a bit untrained in service. As of many young folks nowadays. I saw him using his bare hands to pick up raw fish handed over to the kitchen inside n proceed to using the same hand to write his orders. Yikes.
Cheap and good zichar

Wow freshly prepare & steam fish & fish head in special sauce flavours to satisfy your taste buds... come down & try for yourself to appreciate it... Uncle Mike.
The best Steamed Fish Head in Singapore!
"Wide choice of fish dishes, good taste and reasonable prices"
"Shi Cai Xian,Zhu De Hao Chi ,Jie Qian Da Zhong Hua,Zhi De. "
Nice and I think the taste suit me very well.
Affordable and delish tze char!
Very fresh fish and nyonya paste is nice. Reasonably priced
"Can't get enough of their nyonya fish. The meat is flaky and tender. The tumeric, lemon grass, and lime shallots is very fragrant and flavorful. Other dishes are for side only. You just need to order the nyonya fish period!"
Like the steam fish head so much! Do call the stall owner to preorder so you donot have to wait long.
Very good fish and seafood here!  Value for money and ridiculously delicious too!
"Came here with a buddy of mine to try out the food and were amazed by how affordable the food is and it is very tasty !

It is worth every dollar in Sg to try, and the servings are just right ; not so heavy but perfect.
However if you feel you need more you could always add more :)

Highly recommend the Beef Udon and Fries 
Fries are really crispy and fresh ; the (secret) homemade curry sauce that comes with it is amazing too "
Great Jap food at reasonable price.. Don is great with great variety to chose.  Support the young local chaps if you are around the area. Gem of this hawker center
"Love their don, it's full of flavour in every bite!"
Sous vide chicken breast is valuable. I appreciate the effort!! Not to mention it taste damn delicious!!
"Good food, their chicken kaarage is super good. Meat portion is generous too for rice bowls"
"Hidden Gem at parkway hawker centre! Frequent this place with my family, love the japanese food here. Highly recommend everyone to try their pork belly don, my favourite."
Extremely long wait for mediocre food. Sukiya has better gyudon.
"Best dons around at a reasonable price  we ordered for a office lunch and boss was very accommodating to our lunch hour 
Thanks to Fukudon, we had an awesome lunch! "
Good service and affordable for Japanese food! No queue so the wait was quite fast. The beef sukiyaki don was well marinated and paired well with the egg. :)
"The fries are really good and value for money. I got the pork belly katsu don which is good for hawker food but not life changing. However, I did feel that the dons were quite pricey. The two male chefs were really friendly but the female cashier wasnt the friendliest. Overall, can try if you re near the area but i wouldnt come all the way down."
"I come here every week, tried almost all the dishes, all well executed, a lot of effort and care put into each element. very generous with ingredients and affordable price. Unique flavours and beats most of the dons outside. Servers are very cheerful and friendly.  Chicken breasts could do with a squeeze of lemon tho. Will definitely come back again"
My family's go to place for an affordable meal. The food is good. I recommend the potato salad and the fries. Super super addictive.
"Superb option if you're on hunt for healthy/health food in the area at low prices! I had the sous vide chicken bowl ($6.80). The chicken breast was moist, and the soy honey sauce (to me) had a subtle hint of ginger that made it taste like a healthy version of chicken rice! The portion might look modest, but it's actually rather filling.

I also had a side of tomato salad which was refreshing (+$1.50). Came with raw white onions cucumbers, and sesame dressing. Overall, a satisfying meal that I'd recommend!"
"Chance upon the store when I was searching for lunch. I ordered the Sous Vide Chicken Don and it cost 6.80.

Chicken is tender but was not very tasty, the sauce made the chicken taste a-little better. Onsen egg made the DON nicer

it's seem healthy and a light meal option at an affordable price point."
One of d best Japanese food I've ever tasted. Reasonably priced too. The two gentlemen cooking n serving are very polite n cheerful.
"Pretty good Japanese fusion, though I'll ask for less rice next time."
"Had a really good bowl of pork belly katsu don!
Very quick service. Very short wait!"
Great food!
My post-gym staple!!! Such good value for money 
"Love the salmon mentaiko and the egg, tomato that comes with it."
Very good service and taste good with affordable pricing 
"Ordered the Sous Vide Chicken Don ($6.80) with less rice and no sauce.

Requested for sauce to be provided separately but was told it wasn't possible.

Chicken is tender but was not flavourful, I guess the flavour comes from the sauce mainly.

Overall, quite a balanced meal at an affordable price point. Wished that they could have provided the sauce separately."
Good quality don. Good prices.
Delicious and affordable Japanese fusion food. Will definitely come back to try their other menu items.
"Good food, good price. Portion makes for a nutritional meal for those keeping track of macros."
"Affordable fare, value for money. Did a takeout of mentaiko salmon, it was nicely  seared, generous serving of sides with tomatoes. The short grain rice was fluffy, and egg done nicely. Overall fairly healthy dish, could go easy on the mayo and sauces though. Good portion size for chicken karaage, the curry sauce was awesome. Managed by a friendly crew. Short wait of 10minutes at early lunchtime due to frying of the karaage."
generous amount of chicken . taste fresh . but just a little expensive but worth to eat once or twice a week . not much sodium or msg 
"Very generous portions, great taste"
My favourite is spicy pork collar. Queue can get a little long during weekends. Their food are good.
Highly recommend!
Worth trying their truffle potato salad. Really tasty. Managed by friendly young guys. Highly recommended!
truffle potato salad and fries were  no cap
Food was good. love their black pepper pork collar don and pork belly katsu don. Not to mention their CRISPY FRIES w curry sauce. will come back again!
"Date of visit : Tue 29 Oct 2024
Time : 6.10 pm

First time here.
After talking to the 2 young men manning the stall, decided to order the mentaiko salmon don priced at $9.

Salmon is well seared and tasty. Mentaiko is not so salty! Overall tastes good.
Reasonable Japanese food at hawker price !

Service is friendly !"
"I would appreciate more if the rice is served with Japanese rice instead of jasmine rice hence unable to have a holistic enjoyment to this dish.
The chicken is tender and juicy but blend except for the sauce over it. I wished they would marinate the meat slightly to taste and compliment with the sauce rather than independent on their own"

"Try the pork belly katsu don, it's soft and tender. The fries are also crispy and potatoey, great with the curry sauce!"
"I had two takeaway experiences. The first time was the pork don. However, it was my fault for having it after several hours, which caused the meat to become quite dry.
Today I tried the mentaiko salmon don, which I really liked. Besides good taste, the portion is balanced with the salmon, egg, and vegetables. I also had the chicken karaage. The chicken itself is average, but I liked the dipping sauce a lot. Based on my latest experience, I rate it 4 stars."
Enjoyable first experience here. Ordered the $9 Mentaiko Salmon Don which was very tasty. Onsen egg is soft boiled. Staff are friendly and answered questions about the Japanese terminology. Can recommend. Marine Parade Central HC near the new MRT. Paynow ok.
Value for money and delicious!
Had the chicken added 2 dollars for the extra a good value as they gave all breast meat though prefer drumstick the dish is pretty good and plentiful will be back to try the rest
Do one outlet halal bro!! Would love to try your food!!
"I am reviewing based solely upon the sous vide chicken, which I felt was quite lovely. The chicken serving was generous, the lightly flavoured ginger sauce was pleasant, and the onsen egg was good. For the price of $6.80, it was quite worth it. Unlike other reviewers, I found the service pleasant and the man thanked me. The stall was clean and food was well handled, so I felt comfortable. The side of edamame was also a nice touch. Will go there again!

** * Edited 28 June 2024 ***
Still as good as ever, it is now my regular haunt. Tried their beef udon for the first time, excellent! Soup base is not heavy, nice and fragrant. And the udon noodles is lovely and springy. At $8.50, it is a good cheaper alternative to udons at restaurants. Of course, there is no Aircon, but with the large fans above it is still ok."
"Staff were friendly, food is pricier than usual hawker fare but value for money considering what you get. It's what you'd expect from the usual don bowls out there :) will be back when I crave a Japanese don."
I had a take away parcel during my internship was over and I used to roam and explore around East Coast Beach for last 15 days till my visa gets over.
Family likes the spicy garlic pork collar.  I would say for the price the portion is ok.  Any increase in price or reduction in quanity may make me spend my money elsewhere.
"Simple , healthy bowl concept in a hawker center, worth to try.
Ordered the no1 sous chicken of $ 6.8and top up 1.8 for additional chicken, total price is 8.6.
I am very satisfied with the meal , the chicken is so tendered and juicy, lightly seasoned in the soy sauce . Onsen egg is very good to pair with jasmine rice with a bit sesame topping.

Will come back to try other options."
"Served by two young gentlemen who were very welcoming. Food was made nice and fresh on the spot and was served with an onsen egg. Their udon seems to be their best seller as I overheard it was sold out by dinner time. Would be back to try their other food. Can give it a shot if you're there.

Back there again to try the udon. But it didn't seem to come with the torched corn, taste wise wasn't too bad. But we felt it was too sweet which left us with the dry throat feeling after that."
"Tried their karaage . Not bad but I feel could be more crispy . Like their curry Mayo dip , it compliment the chicken very well . Next round will try their don which look good too."
Good bowl of udon. Added noodles for $1.50.
"Definitely deserve my 5 stars rating . Their don is fantastic and the portion is huge, super filling. Price is v affordable as well"
"Must try their Udon!!! It is soooo good, this could be my new comfort food "
Good food takes time to prepare. Be patient and you will be rewarded with delicious comfort food. Japanese rice coated with Onsen egg is heaven. Well marinated spicy garlic pork added ommmmmf to the whole dish.
"Overall 2.5 out of 5, rounded up to 3 as Google review doesn't have 0.5 score.
Food is good but staff at Marine Parade outlet leaves much to be desired. Ordered pork belly katsudon yesterday, prepared by the young lady. While transporting the pork to the bowl, she dropped a piece on the table. She then threw it away without replenishing it; it wasn't exactly a small piece.
Don't know which is worse, that she dropped it or that she didn't replace it. Worst was she didn't apologize even though she could see me looking on. She was so nonchalant that I wondered if this is something that happens so often that she even dispensed with apologies.
I've read multiple reviews here on the sullen service at this outlet. Guess customer service is not something the stall owners believe in as it's still bad despite all the feedback given. Not expecting great customer service from a hawker stall but it should at least not leave a bad taste. For me, the bad customer experience deters me from ordering again even if food is good."
"Have been wanting to try this for a while now and finally got to try it today. Ordered the pork belly katsudon and beef short plate don. The food is decent, would rate it 3.5 out of 5 stars. The egg and onion in the pork katsudon is flavourful, pork belly is tender enough but I don't particularly fancy the breading that much. Beef is decent, onsen egg is good, but nothing special. Overall for the price paid ($7 and $7.50 each) I would say it's ok, something I may try again.

However, I minused another 0.5 stars because of the service. A number of other reviewers have also pointed out the poor service. Actually, I don't really expect exceptional service in a hawker centre but I think the owners could at least say a simple thank you to customers who patronise their stall. The young lady was the one who served me, and throughout my ordering process I said ""thank you"" at least 2-3 times but she didn't even say a single word back. Nothing at all, she was silent throughout the whole process except when telling me how much to pay. I think they would retain alot more customers if they could just be slightly friendlier and more polite! Good service really goes a long way."
Chicken breast don - efficient source of protein and fast service (good if you are rushing for time)
"New guy at the stall was really nice, service was beyond my expectations especially for a hawker centre. Ordered a spicy pork collar don, my favourite dish in this stall thus far"
"Supposedly a good place to satisfy Japanese food cravings. Met with a expressionless face taking order, not a word spoken. Shoyu grazed salmon don presentation look appetising. Besides shoyu lemon grazed salmon, on the side tomatoes salad with sesame dressing and a onsen egg. Rice served was lukewarm, same for onsen egg, only the salmon was glazed on upon ordering.
Price starting at $6.40 for chicken don, $7 per pork don, $7.60 for salmon don & $7.50 for beef don. Overall, average better option available elsewhere."
"Was there today at lunch time,  wanted the Pork collar with rice, didn't notice the word Spicy .. was greeted by the rude lady telling me is spicy by pointing to the menu on the stall.
And when asked is it very spicy? Again was given a rude reply saying its individual liking.
I had tried the food here before and the stuff was very friendly.
Maybe they should educate this unhappy stuff."
"Opened you young hawker who simply do not appreciate your patronise. Rude. Just rude as if u owe them. Just order whatever from the menu and don't ask for more or less if you don't want that death stare by the lady serving you.

Average food just you won't get the same kind around here.

Will not come back."
"Had the Beef Short Plate Don takeaway. All things considered, this just ok for the price. Could do with a bit more meat. Would I buy it again? Probably not."
10/10 rice bowls
Nestled in Marine Parade FC. Chose pork belly katsu don for takeout. Service was reasonably quick. I suppose the katsu was crispy when it was first prepared. Still tasty with some roe to add saltiness. I will reserve my final verdict when I try dining at the food centre.
Food was mid lah tried the oyaka don presentation COULD USE ALOT OF WORK and for $6.40 there are more options lady manning the counter was super rude
"Value for money.
If oyakodon don't want onions, ask for ""plain"""
"Super yummy and really affordable Japanese rice bowls with many flavours to choose from - featuring chicken, pork, beef, and salmon!
Been a regular customer since they opened here and I have to say that my favourites are definitely the Pork Belly Katsu Don and the Shoyu Glazed Salmon Don.
Their potato salad is also a must-try! Order it with any of their dons to make your meal even more satisfying, and for the extra oomph in flavour.
Also, huge shoutout to the Fukudon team who are always so friendly, making sure that they use only quality ingredients, and putting in their best effort to come up with special flavours every month! Do give them a follow on Instagram to get the latest news on what special flavours they have in store!

Highly recommend their very delicious dons (& sides) if you are in the area and if you are looking for a simple yet hearty meal!!"
"BAD PRESENTATION!!! Most of the time you don't get what you see but this is way off from its photo on the menu. This is one good example of long queue doesn't mean you get great food.

Had Pork Belly Katsu Don. Meat is crispy and sweet due to the sauce. Jasmine rice does not match the whole Don experience. I can see why  this is a fusion and understand why it's open at hawker centre. There are better hawker food  than fukudon.

Good for neighborhood customers but not meant for me. Cheers"
Ordered via grabfood. There was a metal string in the rice omg.. Luckily didn't swallow
The Chicken Oyakodon us very nice and delicious and also the potato salad is superb too
Ordered this as a takeaway and have to say it's a disappointment. It is a little underseasoned and the pork is very porky. Chicken is a bit too dry
"Saved this stall for quite some time, happen to be in the vicinity of Marine Parade and decided to drop by for a meal.  Reached the place slightly after lunchtime around 2pm and it wasn't crowded.  i was able to order immediately. Quite a varieties of items on their menu but decided to go with the Sukiyaki beef short plate don which was SGD$7.50.  Waited for few mins before my food was ready.

Portion of meat seems quite little, a bit hard to justify that amount I paid. Flavor wise, not bad but the meat was rather cold when I consumed. Even the gravy that comes with the rice bowl was room temperature, would be a better experience if the sauce was warm.

Overall, the experience was below my expectation after reading so many good reviews from those food bloggers. Would i be back? probably not. Had better rice bowl elsewhere that is more value for money."
"Ordered the Miso Salmon Don to try. Maybe I should've ordered something else... 

Taste: 3/5 This dish is for mayo fanatics since they put so much mayo that it ended overpowering the taste of the miso... Onsen egg, pickles and rice were mediocre too

Portion: 3/5 Not the most generous, received 3 rather skimpy pieces of salmon

Price: 3/5 Damage was $8.80 for takeaway"
"I'm a true fan of their Shoyu Salmon Don! First tried about 2yrs ago and have been loving it ever since!

A useful pro tip: If you have not, do try this dish eaten on the spot (instead of take away). Only eaten there will you favor the crispy crunchy pan fried salmon skin! It's really awesome, together with the rest of the favor that comes with the dish, it's absolutely crazily delicious!!!
This dish also comes at an affordable price compared to food courts/restaurants.
Try it! You will not be disappointed!

Another Pro tip: The friendly staff takes in advance paid order, so if you are like me whom needs to buy food from other stalls, you can order first from them, and collect eg 20mins later. They will then cook your order nearer your collection time! Rest assured, your food will be hot and fresh when collected!

-------------------------

Love their Salmon Don! Comes with generous portion of tomato and oranges. (Sounds weird combo, but is very very very delicious!). Their Salmon is a must try!"
Best!!! Must try
"Delicious, fast and efficient"
"By far one of my favourite dishes to get. Delicious, fatty and filling rice bowl"
"We've been eating here since it's opened. My son's favourite is sukiyaki beef.
Very good quality and recommended to try."
"FOUND EGG SHELL IN FOOD
Would give 0 star ,  the service is NEGATIVE. I understand is a hawker , not paying service fee or something but when customer asking a question would appreciate if able to answer it nicely instead showing a face which makes customer feels that they're stupid ? You're selling your food , you know what's inside but customer don't !

Ordered the katsu don , AND FOUND EGG SHELL

Basically worst experience and this is OVER RATTED"
"Nothing special, taste pretty average.

Opened by young hawkers who seriously lack of basic courtesy and manners/service. Won't support a business like this. Note that this is not a restaurant or cafe but a hawker- who don't even have the basic/simple hello and thank you, but black face lol

Witnessed another customers who came back to collect his order ""hello my salmon okay already?"" and the woman just mumbled to herself (not even facing the customer) ""there"". And then customer went to take himself 

Food taste so-so, hence I won't bother trying out or giving them another chance because of the lousy attitude.

Still Bedok market place's The Burning Oak is the best."
"Jason still does a fantastic don

Oishi desu!"
Have eaten here multiple times over the year. The food is good value for the price.
"had the pork katsu don.. its reasonably price - yes, i then realise its bcos there's more fat than meat inside! also had the karaage, it was decent."
Held a mini lunch groupbuy for my neighbours and all gave very good review esp dishes under the chef's recommendation. Servings are huge and child friendly too. Will definitely come back for more again.
"Not as good as many say... tried the katsudon plate, just breaded meats, pork belly a bit too fat and by far not as good as a grilled pork belly... potato salad ok but nothing to write home about..."
Ordered chicken Oyakodon and the Sukiyaki beef short plate for the first time. Generous portion and it's delicious and affordable. A gem hidden in the heartlands.
"I went to order pork katsudon today, there was a long queue. I placed my order, then went back to my table. When I went to pick up my order, I saw it was already in a plastic bag. I rushed  to collect my order and went back home. Then I realized at home there were two packages instead of just one, it turned out I took the wrong order and it was someone else's.

My two daughters liked the beef and salmon order that I accidentally took. I tried to contact them through WhatsApp, and the response was very fast, they understood and asked me to come back and return the food or to keep on the house. We are very happy with the order and the service!"
Karaage here is super sexy  freshly fried and crispy. All the donburi are really good and affordable. Will definitely come here again for comfort food

Verdict:
definitely must try, worth queuing up"
"The rice looks like it's short-grain but tastes just like the rice you get from an average cai fan stall. The sukiyaki beef don was okay in terms of price-to-meat ratio, and the beef strips were pretty tender. Onsen egg texture was also on point. But unfortunately, I really hated the rice quality so I wouldn't be back. The Spicy Marinated Pork Collar wasn't great for us too. The so-called pork collar is actually made with minced pork and didn't have the flavour or texture we were expecting. Given the price point, these are forgiveable but there's also nothing to draw me back, unless I can just dabao onsen eggs a la carte."
"Ordered in for reservist, food received as packed well and still tasted delicious. Free delivery for orders above $50, minimum order amount starts from $20 ($10 delivery fee islandwide).

Menu is very diverse, will definitely have something for everyone. Ordered their blackboard menu special, which was satay pork collar with achar and egg floss. Pork was very tasty and tender!!! Will definitely come back.

Heard they are opening an outlet in Punggol soon and can't wait to have Fukudon in my hood..."
"Was recommended by my family to come and try. First of all, I am always skeptical when I see sprinkles of furikake and powders on top of the bowl, because the Japanese themselves rarely do that as it mostly skews the taste of the meat and rice. Portion is decent. But the worst of all was the rice. Never seen such a bad rice before. Don't even talk about it being Japanese rice or not, it's dry and brittle as hell. Felt like overnight rice or something. Tried to be understanding, but man it was super disappointing."
Really good food. Clean and healthy. Love the potato salad. Must try
"FOOD IS AWESOME. Chef Remus even provided delivery personally.

Chicken Katsu and Mentaiko is a must try!!!"
"Great food at even better prices. Tastes superb with huge portions, happy to support the team of young hawkers."
Had a takeaway pork belly don with added beef. Taste and texture was good and the portion was more than enough. Price was fair for the quality and portion. Will recommend whoever is in the area to try the store. Would come back to try dining in at the hawker as I can only imagine how fantastic the food would be eating it fresh out of the kitchen!
"Food is fantastic and tasty
Definitely won't be a disappointment

Overalls 10/10"
"Nice & delicious and also very affordable price.
Definitely Will go back to eat again. "
Awesome food and affordable! Highly recommended!
Awesome food and price is highly affordable for the masses. Will surely return for more.
"Generous servings, super tasty pork belly and beef! price is reasonable with friendly young hawkers! will come back again"
Fukudon's food is really good and is super value for its money!
Food is nice and affordable!
The food is nice and not costly. 
The sukiyaki beef don is my go-to order at Fukudon! Very tasty and affordable!
"I have always respected the younger generation to venture into the hawker industry. But definitely not for this particular hawker. With such an attitude, I will never patronise this shop anymore"
Love the spicy pork collar don. Restaurant quality at food court price. 
Friendly proprietors and the food is decent. One of the best potato salads I've tried
This place is a hidden gem. Fantastic dons at very reasonable prices. Great value for money! Will be back again soon.
"Located at Marine Parade hawker, this stall specializes in dons.

We has the sukiyaki don and the katsu don. Both were very good and the soft boiled eggs were perfectly cooked. Flavours were on point, wasn't expecting this from a hawker stall. 

The food is very reasonably priced too.

Expect a queue if you are going during peak hours and this place only accepts cash."
"Have always wanted to try this but only open at noon. (So has severely limited my ability to eat this earlier cos I prefer to eat lunch before 12noon)
tried the spicy pork collar --
Did not look as nice as the photos.  It was incredibly yellow.... Curry powder as the primary ingredient in the pork? I would have expected it to be drizzled in spice powders.....  if I knew it was curry powder I would not have ordered this!!!

The meat dishes were fried on the spot.... And the pork shreds were not properly separated and ended up stuck together, clumped together, I was worried it be uncooked in between.

The so called onsen egg was only '50%' there. Had a video but could not put it up.  Only a little egg yolk oozed out, the rest were semi hard.

Semi generous in the spring onions but wish they gave a bit more (even tho I asked for more); or to have a bit more garnishing.  Since it fusion, how about fried garlic chips/crumbs or even shallots.

Unlikely I will go back to try their other dishes."
Pretty good donburi for a very cheap price. Rice doesn't taste all that Japanese unfortunately.
"Didn't enjoy the food. Too egg was too sweet, and the pork katsu very flat. Waste of calories"
"Have been patronising this stall for a few months with my friends. The food is always of standard, and it's definitely worth it for the price. The portion is good! For a dollar more, you can have a double portion of chicken! (Good for you people trying to clock in your protein)

Ps. I've read through the other reviews. & I think if you've too, please give it a try on your own. Cause IMO, it's definitely worth it. Kudos to the chef!!

Staff service maybe slightly improved. But overall, the food makes me a happy girl."
Ordered the Pork Belly Katsu Don. Good texture and taste but could do with a complimentary Miso Soup.
"Humble stall at a hawker centre not far from ECP - good effort run by some youngsters & food is not bad.

I'll visit again if I'm in the area, just won't queue for it if the line is long.

Happy to support young entrepreneurs."
"There was already a long queue when I arrived before the store opened. The queue started before the stall opened at 12, so do be prepared to wait. We ordered the Short Plate Beef Bowl, Tonkatsu Bowl, Katsu Platter and Thunder Crunchy fries to share among 3 pax. The Katsu Platter and Tonkatsu Bowl were nicely executed for deep fried items - though we felt that we had slightly too much fried stuff towards the end. The beef bowl was much lighter and went well with the onsen egg. The rice in both bowls were a bit ""heavy"". The Thunder Crunchy Fries live up to their name in crispness, and comes with a nice (though not unique) dip."
"New stall at this hawker centre. Had the chicken karaage with curry sauce and rice for $4.50 - impressed by the huge portion for such a price. I left the place feeling extremely full. The chicken was served piping hot, and the thigh meat was well marinated, very tender, and layered with a well seasoned, crisp and light batter.

The curry sauce was interesting as I expected it to be Japanese curry but it seemed like a rendition of McDonald's curry sauce (but a more pineapple-y version of it).

The additional side of potato salad though, was extremely disappointing which contributed to the reduction in stars for this review. While the serving size was also larger than what I had expected, this seemed more like an onion salad. There was a disproportionately large amount of almost-raw, crunchy onions in the salad which ruined the entire dish.

Overall some hits and misses - would rate it 3.5 stars. Worth giving them a chance if you're in the area."
"Good food. Very tasty. For Japanese food, I think the price is really worth for what you get"
"Got the sukiyaki Beef Don with egg. It stated that there's onions but somehow I don't think I ate or tasted any?

The rice was not bad, drenched with the beef drippings which added some flavour to the plain rice.
Furikake was placed on top of the meat only and didn't really add much value to the dish. Tasted more of the togarashi powder which is the Japanese chili powder.
Beef was tender but they could have been more generous with the amount given. The teriyaki sauce was okay, tasted like how it should be.
For my onsen egg, was a little disappointed as the yolk already broke.

Overall an average tasting don with a constant queue of customer."
"Ordered the Karage  with homemade curry. The Karage tasted really good, super crispy on the outside  and moist on the inside and the curry went well okay with the rice. Topped up 50cents for rice so my meal costed about $5. Will come back again next time :)"
Not good at all.
Inspiring success
"Could have given 0 if possible

Extremely disappointed with the Pork Belly Katsu Don & Beef Don

Both dishes fell way below expectations and do not expect your food to look
even similar to what was shown on the menu

Katsu was soggy, Beef was tough

Will not visit again

Pricing wise @ S$6.90 you can tastier food than this at Marine Parade Hawker Centre with spare change"
Fantastic food at a very competitive price.
"My family's latest favorite Donburi place. Restaurant standard, hawker center price."
The Pork Belly Don... I've tasted more expensive ones that aren't as good. If you're talking value this is it right here. Nom nom nom.
"The chicken was cold..... new establishment so that's ok, theres always room for improvements.

1/5. Mainly for the poor attitude and rude girl taking order. When told the food is cold, she just stares at u. Terrible especially when some of us work in the service industry. She could have nicely communicated but chose to act snobbish.

Would have given 2 stars for the food, 0 star for the person taking order. Thus 1 star rating."
"Tasty again, got pork belly donburi and karaage this time. Worth the wait,  and love that it's so close to home."
"Food was kinda disappointing compared to the good reviews written online. Not very value in terms of taste for the price... I wont be queuing again.

The issue is the service staff who has a poor attitude when taking customers order/requests and does not seem trained when it comes to food handling. On multiple occasions saw this staff scratching her hair then handling customer's food and not wearing mask properly."
"Always wanted to try this stall at Marine Parade hawker center, but they are always closed. Little did I realise their operating hours is 12-3pm only and 6pm till sold out? And they are closed on Monday. It's quite complicating. Anyway, on to the food. Ordered the Spicy garlic pork collar Don w/ onsen egg ($6.60) and the Homemade chicken karaage w/ curry sauce ($4.50)

The spicy garlic pork collar Don was so-so. For the amount and price, it was slightly pricey. The Karaage with curry sauce on the other hand was really nice. Light, crispy, chicken tender inside. Goes well with the curry sauce although the curry sauce tastes like from McDonald's. Overall, decent food, slightly high prices."
Thought that it was way too salty. Was really quite average taste-wise. Seems overpriced to me at $6.60.
Value and quality.
Cheap price but the taste is nice
It was a nice bowl of katsudon. I felt it was bit on the salty side and it wasn't anything special. Price was reasonable given the small portion but was it worth the 30 mins wait? Maybe not. I may be tempted if the queue was shorter.
"New Asian fuision eating place that sell donburi.
Made with love and passion by chef Remus, bringing nostalgic deep flavours to bring happiness to those who eats.
Will update for more detail."

"A great combination of sambal, nasi lemak and especially the drum stick at an extremely affordable price.
Followed this stall from the old woodlands checkpoint center to Marsiling mall hawker center.

Would recommend this stall 10/10"
"i've always been a regular customer of this store as the uncle here is nice and always remember my order! that is why i always patronize this stall whenever i come to marsiling mall hawker centre, without fail! "
"Easily the top 5 Chinese Nasi Lemak in Singapore. Been eating here since the 90s at old Woodlands Centre. Suggested order items: drumstick, crabstick"
"Honestly the food is quite mid, downgraded quite abit, quite sad ngl"
"Homely taste of nasi lemak, food is always served hot. Have been patronising this stall for a long time as my children really love their food! Come give it a try on your own!"
"my go to nasi lemak at least once a week during weekdays lunch. affordable prices, nice and fragrant coconut rice, juicy and crispy chicken. do top up the curry veg as well!"
Fragrance rice jengg
"My second time having their nasi lemak and it was still as great - I ordered the set which comes with drumstick, egg and veg. Portion was generous and they will cut up the chicken for you making it easier to eat.

A family business and owners are friendly. It's one of the better nasi lemak I've eaten and I definitely recommend! Price is affordable too at less than $4.50."
"I have been eating this store for more than 10 years. My favorite is their bee hoon with chicken wings, crabsticks, long beans and fish stick. The taste is awesome and the standard has been maintain through the years. The level of cleanliness is one of the tip top I've see in a hawker store. Uncle Auntie and their son take pride in their work! Worth going through the hawker to locate their store n I'm sure u will not be disappointed"
Chanced upon this stall in Marsiling mall. The rice and chicken wing is amazing. Very affordable at less than 4 dollars per pax
"The Nasi Lemak rice is amazing! The rice is very fragrant here as there is enough coconut milk (something sadly lacking at a lot of stalls outside). Other dishes are delicious too, including their chicken drumstick and otah. 

Serving is generous, price is affordable. They have a $3.60 set including egg, chicken wing and crabstick.

Service is good. Owners are friendly, and they will heat up your dishes to make sure the food is mininally warm. The rice is  fragrant and hot on its own, very awesome.

The shop is located at the back of the hawker center (01-60). If u are not sure where is it, ask around for the owner with a burnt hand.

Give the stall a try, its worth it. "
"They have nice nasi lemak at this place, I like the fried chicken drumstick, will always order 2"
Nasi lemak is really fragrant and has the pandan taste. The chili is balanced- sweet and not too spicy. Uncle is really friendly and attentive. He will toast and cut the chicken drumstick for you before serving.
"Most delicious Nasi lemak ever eaten.
The rice is fluffy with pandan, fragant sambal chilli that is perfect with the cabbage n drumstick. Best part, drumstick is re toasted, then uncle will cut the meat off the bone, making it easy to eat! Hot n crispy skin
Sambal chili is handmade in-house, and uncle always ask if I want more 
Every Saturday, must go for set 3. (Closed on Sunday)"
"Best nasi lemak in marsiling mall. Old school green nasi lemak rice, crispy n juicy fried chicken drumstick & crabstick are delicious! Chilli also good!!"
My favourite nasi lemak! Best chicken wings for nasi lemak
"Very good nasi lemak, even better than that other nasi lemak stall that many queue for.

Uncle is very friendly, and they always help to cut up the drumstick, making it easier to eat!

Been a regular now!"
"Best nasi lemak at marsiling mall. Better than tian tian which always has a long queue and tian tian is very stingy with rice, chilli and everything. Gao Ji is very generous - just tell them if you want more chilli, no additional charge, unlike tian tian. And their chilli is better too. Their rice is more lemak too and great service. They always cut the drumstick so that it's easy for anyone, old or young, to eat.

Did I mention also that they are about 1 dollar cheaper than tian tian? Their sets are all price at 3+ to 4+, whereas Tian tian start from 4.50 onwards.

They still kept the very old yellow signboard that reads gao ji out of nostalgia because it has helped fed the family for decades"
"Very old school and nostalgic, my comfort food."
The best Nasi Lemak in the Woodland area must try.
"1st time trying this nasi lemak from this shop and it was amazing! The fried chicken is very good, green lemak rice has the old school taste along with the egg and cabbage. Pure simple nasi lemak like how it should be! I also like to commend on the fastidious arrangement of the nasi lemak in my own take out box, the young man took pride in it.

To round it all up, the chilli is damn good too, very spicy!

Used to buy from the other stall with long queues, but their standard and serving size had dropped tremendously thus bringing me to this shop. No regrets!"
Best nasi lemak ever. They moved here from Woodlands Centre (which is now flattened). Must try the fried chicken and their chilli sauce!
"Never failed me the service and food.
Come back multiple times. Best nasi lemak in this hawker, or one of best in woodlands."
Great service and very polite
"My favourite nasi lemak in this area, great service from the friendly stall-owners, highly  recommend their amazing fried chicken"

"Golden Leaf Kway Chap
Woodlands 11 (ADMIRALTY AREA)
 QR PayNow
Recommended is to dine in. Not takeaway.

Among admiralty area, I feel this stall is best cos'

1) quality of braised pig parts are very clean
2) Chew the parts are very soft.
3) The quality of Hor fun white noodle is very good unlike other stalls -too sticky and soggy. The cooker knows how to make noodle full wet with a good soup! Trust me!
4) Chili sauce for Kway Chap is awesome, have quite tasty. Others got wateryyyyy

Next time if you taste something wrong, pls give the cooker a good feedback. They will improve. They are humble and hardworking to keep the parts very good and cleaner. None of them smelt!  Your feedback can help them continuing their best to give you good ones! Ya!

Best time to go there is morning, fresher!
No aircon, v hot while eating hot soup, ya.
Esp pigeons terrible walking around. It is a place u have to know. But nonetheless, go for that stall .

Take bus 901M, drop off at opp 639. Or
Walk from Admiralty MRT to the stall (10mins). When you see Spectra Secondary school building, it means u can reach the coffeeshop about 5mins)  total 15mins walk (treat it as your exercise walk, why not)"
"I have enjoyed the duck rice here ever since they started. A number of stalls here have changed hands over the years but they have remained. To me, the quality of their duck rice has been consistently good and the portions are value for money. The duck is tender and flavourful, while the rice is plump and not overly moist or ""wet."" In a nice contrast to what you will find at some duck rice stalls, the rice itself is not all that ""dark"" while the sauce which is ladled over is not viscous but has a lighter touch. It's a tasty and satisfying plate of duck rice for me. Service is pleasant, too."
"One Of My Favorite Duck Rice, Soup, Noodle & Kway Chap For e Past 10 Over Years... I'll Popped Over If I Can Whenever I Passed By e Area For Sure...  Slurp Slurp Yummy Yummy!!!"
No replacement of other items in the mixed kway chap and no changes in price when we omitted the dau pok
Another hidden gem in the neighborhood... Kway chap is so good on par with all the super popular ones... Please no blogger come
"Previously ordered braised platter from a different staff.. Platter came with 2 eggs (4 halves) lots of duck, tau pok, intestines etc..we wanted to add but staff said is enough for 2 pax and he was right ..Food also came in a big box

Today ordered platter again, box was the standard duck rice box..sensed something wrong so opened it up..very little of everything, 1 egg (2 halves), we even asked for top up of intestines which we paid extra for but amount is less than what we got previously without topping up.. It was not the previous staff.. This was a different person.. Looked shifty when asked if it was the correct order ..he insisted it was.. Very obvious he trying to cheat us ..didn't press the matter further because he didn't understand English and we had our baby with us..likely won't patronise this place again unless owner investigates and take action for his staff.."
They don't remove the hair from the pig skin.
Tasty and value for money Kway Chap with tender braised duck. Rare gem in heartland
Ordered a pack of the duck rice and surprising very nice. A very rare gem in the north part of Singapore.
Suprised! Braised duck one of the best! Tender boneless. Friendly fast clean tidy authentic tasty local as well as western steaks.
a hearty bowl of prawn noodles! smaller prawns were really good bc they were extra sweet :) ngoh hiang was done well too

"[MULTIPLE OUTLETS, SINGAPORE] If you are looking for full on umami flavour, @haemeesg's prawn noodles have what you need. I've always loved their prawn broth from their prawn claypot steamboat outlets, but their dry noodle sauce is even better!

They sell renditions of their prawn noodles from $6.50 for the basic bowl, to $11.50 for the one with jumbo prawns. I suggest getting the dry version, as their noodles are tossed in their handmade chilli sauce that has a lot of umami flavours coming from the amount of garlic and dried shrimps used. Chilli packs quite a punch as well!

Their jumbo prawns are indeed huge, but I personally will get their Mixed Organ Prawn Noodle ($9.90), as it is packed with loads of pig organ ingredients that are very well cooked. Their liver slices were still bouncy, and they had sliced kidneys as well that had a good bite!

To pair your noodles, you can get their mixed fried ingredients (wu xiang). It's decent, just nothing much to shout out about. The chilli sauce to pair with the ingredients is great though, as it has a nice citrus kick!

Thank you for the invite @haeclaypotsg, my family and I had a good meal  Yes many might think that it's quite expensive for a hawker meal, but the abundant quality ingredients definitely made it worth it!"
The soup is really flavourful and the prawns fresh. I had the Signature prawn noodles dry with chilli. It was simply delicious.
"This is one of the best prawn noodles in the East. I like the rich broth and the freshness of the prawns. Their beehoon is thicker type, and I had the dried version with chilli, which is really tasty. It's a bit of queue as I went on a Sunday. They also sell ngoh Hiang which is very tasty with the chilli dip. Will definitely visit again when I go Marine Parade hawker :))"
Love the combination of the flavours. The prawn broth was tasty & the king prawns were fresh & juicy. I am  definitely going back for more & bring my friends along.
"Tried the Prawn Mee here and it was great. We ordered:**

1.  Signature Big Prawn Noodle (Soup) - $11.90:Big, sweet prawns and fresh prawn balls. Very good. (Comes soup or dry).
2.  Mixed Organ Prawn Noodle (Soup) - $9.90: Tender pork organs (no weird taste) and well-prepared pork slices. Good balance.

The noodles had a perfect texture and the soup was rich and comforting. Nice bonus: free extra noodles (30g) if you want!

Also tried some items from the Ngoh Hiang stall next door - everything was well-fried and tasty. Their chili sauce was fragrant and added nice flavor (not spicy).

Even when it wasn't peak time, there was a steady queue, which shows this place is popular for good reason.

Everything we had was well-made. Definitely recommend giving it a try!"
"Tried the dry jumbo prawn noodles and it was very flavourful! The soup that came with the noodles tasted so rich and sweet, you can definitely taste the prawns that were used in the soup.

I visited their first outlet, and they have improved their menu and added new items! Honestly, I love the pig's internal organs - they were well cleaned and cooked to the perfect texture. The newly added dish - ngoh hiong was fresh and crispy.

Although the wait for the food and queue was quite long, but the food was really freshly cooked upon ordering."
"Just opposite Marina Parade MRT! We ordered the signature prawn noodle, the mixed organ prawn noodle and the original prawn noodle with some ngo hiang. The broth was flavourful and the prawns were so fresh! I especially love the crackers and the youtiao with prawn paste, the chilli was to die for!"
"Tried the No.1 Big Tiger Prawn Mee (Soup) and No.4 Prawn Mee (dry)  - both were really satisfying. The broth was rich and flavourful, and the prawns were fresh. Ngoh Hiang was crispy and tasty too.

Friendly service and clean space. Glad to have this new spot in Marine Parade. Will definitely come back!"
"Congrats @haemeesg on the opening of your latest outlet at Marine Parade Hawker Centre! Super convenient location just next to the MRT exit.

The fam arrived before 12pm but a queue was already forming. Everyone loved the broth, which has FREE REFILLS by the way 

Just like the Chai Chee outlet, ingredients were fresh, plentiful and great value for money! The fam commented that the chilli for the ngoh hiang was very special and irresistible. Guess we'll be coming back for more! Thank you once again for the invite!!!"
"Been a die-hard fan of Bai Nian prawn paste balls and Haemee is also part of their group and it is really delish!

For just $6+, you get not one, but two succulent whole prawns in a bowl of rich, umami-packed broth that's been simmered low and slow with prawn heads, pork bones, and aromatics. Recommended "
"Go during off peak so no need to queue.

Hae! Ngoh Hiang is exclusively available in this outlet. You need to try their sauce- it's tangy and a little spicy, making it so addictive! This unique sauce ties it all together. All of us love it so much that we don't just eat ngoh hiang -- we dunk it into the sauce.

Of course, we ordered their Hae! Mee too! We tried their dry version before at Chai Chee and we are all fans of it! And so this time round, we all ordered their Hae! Mee dry which comes with a refillable of bowl of prawn broth. but the dry noodles sauce mix was better at Chai Chee. their prawn broth was better than before 

The kway tiao was not the thicker and chewier version previously which I prefer! Hope they can bring it back "
"I recently visited Ha Mee's new outlet at Marine Parade, and it was fantastic! The Signature Prawn Noodle Soup was incredibly flavorful, with big, fresh prawns. Don't miss their homemade Ngoh Hiang--it's delicious!"
"Slightly above average.
Glad to hAve tried it but not worth the Q time.
Pretty slow from what I see.
My orders were messed up. Added $2 worth pork slices but forgotten.
Prawns were not fresh at all, mushy kind.
That's weird for a new shop.
I thought its just that 1-2 prawns but it's all our prawns.
Great disappointing meal indeed."
"We had to queue for a while, but it was worth the wait. Since the place is newly opened, it's understandable that they might still be gaining experience. I had big prawn noodles soup with bihun, I really enjoyed their soup broth, it was very flavorful. The prawns were large. We tried their Goh Hiang too, yummy. Very satisfied drip with the chili. Definitely must try!"
"New opening wanted to try but the 3 young people are very slow the guy who do cooking is fine but the 2lady 1 are helping with the sauce and preparing 1 are doing ordering but very slow as no experience

I'll be back to try out the food"
Very expensive and very normal taste. Run by a group of youngster with nails longer than your hair. Slow service and not worth the hype
Super shiok soup broth that is so sweet and flavourful.  The prawn is full size and fresh too! Free additional noodle if you need and soup refill is free too! They even have ngoh hiang. So good and yummy.  Worth a try!
"Bad service, was waiting behind a group for almost 10 minutes, think they were not attended to (even with 4 people in the stall) and they eventually left.

I stepped forward, waited another 5 minutes, no one bothered to take my order."
"Hae Mee SG's second outlet at Marine Parade delivers more than just fresh decor; it's a flavour-forward upgrade with smart tweaks to classic prawn noodles. Diners now enjoy refillable soup and a free 30g noodle add-on, adding extra comfort to each bowl.

The Signature Big Prawn Noodle ($11.90) pairs thick bee hoon with yellow noodles in a savoury toss, crowned with QQ prawn balls, crispy pork lard, and large shell-on prawns. The broth packs deep prawn richness and is now refillable, amping up the shiok factor.

The new Mixed Organ Prawn Noodle ($9.90) features cleanly prepped offals and noodles, less chewy but extra slurp-worthy with its glossy savoury coating. The classic Prawn Noodle ($6.90) stands strong with sweet, briny prawns and an umami-rich soup that trumps their first outlet's version.

On the side, the Homemade Ngoh Hiang ($0.80-$3) adds crisp, umami-laced bites with a standout sauce that channels something like Thai sweet chilli meets Tom Yum.

Patient in accommodating picky request."
"If you're looking for a bowl of comforting prawn noodles, this is the place to be! Umami filled prawn rich broth filled with mixed pork innards and crispy pork lard. Pair it with their ngoh hiang for the best combi!"
"New prawn mee started by the group behind Bainian. Soup (on its own) for the dry noodles is more gao and umami!
Prawn noodle is slighty above average but the highlight for me is definitely the housemade wuxiang selections & chilli. Very tasty for all 6 items we picked, and chilli complement very well. You need to top it off for the perfect meal!"
"Jumbo prawn mee super shiok! Love the broth rich, prawns fresh, noodles just nice. The pork skin and liver done just the way I like it! Wu xiang also crispy and flavourful, not oily at all. Feels like old-school taste done right. Staff very friendly too! confirm will come back"
"There is no shortage of seriously awesome prawn noodles from OAP to East Coast but with the addition of Hae! Mee at 84, the four heavenly king (prawn) collective is complete. This is it. Absolutely mind blowing umami broth like died and went to prawn head pork bone heaven. Peeling the huge fat meaty big prawns here reminded me of the prawns at Kallang Live Prawn Noodles at OAP, my other all time fav. The shell don't stick like many others. Gives Beach Rd a good run for the money. This one is more worth it to me. The amount of sauce that goes into the dry noodles is also one of the most intense I've ever had. Everything here is intense like kena punch in the face while having a prawn party in the mouth. Soup can top up some more. Will be back to take my bowl to the next level. Adding this to my fav list. So haepy. Ultimate shiok."
"Tried the new Hae! Mee outlet at Marine Parade 84 Foodcourt -- the Mixed Organ Prawn Noodle was rich and flavourful, with tender pork slices, liver, and intestines that paired perfectly with the broth. Also loved the homemade Ngoh Hiang -- crispy and tasty. Clean, friendly service."
Fantastic place! The noodles were so flavourful!
"We are at Marine Parade to check out the opening of Hae! Mee 2nd outlet!

Hae Mee meaning Prawn Noodles!

We tried;
Signature Big Prawn Noodles (Soup)
Prawn noodle (Soup)
Assorted Wu Xiang (fried crackers)

Love the peppery prawn broth with its distinctive aftertaste!

The noodles and a thicker mee hoon makes a surprisingly pleasant texture to the dish!

By the people behind Hae! Prawn Claypot, you know this is going to be unique and tasty!"
"Not so bad, at least got Salted Fish Rice with includes a diced Char Siew meat. No other places can have this Char Siew.

With eggs, diced char siew and salted fish, it's already what I liked overall."
"Was a bit hopeful when I saw that my chicken fried rice had a bit of charring. Unfortunately there was a lack of wok hei, possibly due to me eating it more than an hour after takeaway.

The quantity of meat was pretty good, although it wasn't well marinated, if at all.

Overall taste would have been 4 stars, but it was let down by the fact that the rice was somewhat badly cooked. It was similar to the grains you find in porridge, if they were dried up."
"Here Come The Lala Inspired, Fried Hokkien Mee !

"Highly recommended Hokkien Mee.

Personally, best tasting hokkien mee of all the hawker centres that I have been to. Went back 5 times in 2 weeks just for their Hokkien Mee. Could do with bigger or few more prawns but that might just be me nitpicking.

PS: I rarely put out google reviews. But, had to for this one."
"Their signature noodles is quite nice, stock is tasty, noodles is QQ.  An alternative to traditional hokkien mee."
"Hungry and craving for luncheon meat again lol... Regretted not getting the XLB  but I got their Fried Rice w Luncheon Meat tho... Rice altho not so wokhey enough but taste was not that bad. Can't say it is very nice but definitely will try other dishes next time. And hope the XLB won't have to wait so long... (I didn't ask, but some outlet need to wait like half n hour so I didn't get) Luncheon meat and rice portion was generous. Thank you, I am so full now lol

(PS: the reason Idw to wait is bcoz of the heavy stench out there. Each time I walk past I feel like I will die of the smell outside )"

"I had the Nasi Goreng Mutton which cost $5. Even though this stall is mainly known for their mee goreng, their nasi goreng is superb too! The portion was big, and there was wok hei. I would definitely come back if given the chance!"
"IMHO, this is the Best Mee goreng combo so far!"
"His beehoon goreng slaps--and at just $5, it's a steal. You get a good mix of mutton, veggies, and green chilli, and if you ask for it extra spicy, he throws in some chilli padi cuts! 

Flavour-wise, it's got more aroma and depth than most similar joints, probably thanks to the fresh tomato he uses and there's good wok hei going on too, with the potatoes nicely fried, blending in perfectly with the beehoon.

Tried the mixed Maggi + beehoon goreng once, and that combo really hits--way better texture than just beehoon alone."
"Mee Goreng (SGD $6) @ Hass Bawa.
.
Established since 1978 by Abdul Latiff Mohammed Kassim, this legendary stall serves what many consider to be the best rendition of its kind.
.
Slightly greasy, full on smoky aroma, this features yellow noodles tossed with cabbage, bean sprouts, green chili, diced potato, mutton cubes, chicken egg, and a side of cucumber glazed with tomato ketchup.
.
Has combined chewy tender soft crisp textures, with bold smoky meaty vegetal grainy salty savoury sweet spice flavour. The heat lingers on the palate, and the dish is balanced enough to make you crave more."
"Hassbawa's mee goreng (8/10) was delicious. The noodles wasn't overly greasy, with a savory, peppery profile and subtle hints of wok hei. The portion was large and generous with chunky, flavorful bits of mutton.

The mee goreng was fried on the spot right after we ordered, ensuring it was fresh and full of flavor. The noodles held up even after take-away! Definitely made with lots of love."
"The Mee Goreng/ Pattaya Mee Goreng here is pretty good. It's better than majority of the other places I had tried before.

Have been a repeated patron for almost once a week in recent few months, food is always very good, very hygienic and met with very friendly service. Most locals who stayed nearby would definitely agree with me."
"Food was prepared unhygenic as after consumption in the afternoon, encountered extreme stomach discomfort with multiple rounds of toilet over the night and also bouts of stomach churning constantly. Next day morning condition was none the better. Hopefully will recovered by myself as I have taken charcoal and stomach pain medication prescribed by doctor in previous visits and saved for emergency situations like this."
Flavourful and Tasty Mee Goreng!! Well worth the price! Keep visit again to buy more
"Used to eat here very often during my sec sch days. Happy that the taste hasn't changed. This mee goreng is the benchmark that I compare other mee gorengs with.

The colour of the mee is ruby red. The mee is not too greasy and has a bit of char. A bit of egg stir fried with the mee. Bits of chunky mutton. Yum! "
Very friendly boss. Very delicious and big portion mee goreng. Go go Manchester United! 
"Good service, good mutton soup"
"Thick mutton soup (meat) with balanced savoury taste + ""wok hey"" nasi goreng seafood = $12
Not too MSG taste, which is 
Both portion is good for male adult.
Airy and clean hawker centre."
"Searched for best mee goreng in Marine parade and this came up. One of the more hardworking stalls that open till 830pm in the market. By evening most of the stalls here are closed. I like this version ofee goreng, not too oily and have bits of mutton. Portion seems huge but you can easily down this. Recommended. Value for money."
My go to place for mutton soup. The gravy is thick and creamy and good to have with rice or bread :)
had a very satisfying dinner here.
Legit! The best now. Esp the Mee Kuah and the BeeHoon Goreng Mutton!
Can clearly see and taste his passion in frying 
"Googled ""the best mee goreng in Singapore"" and this came up. I'm surprised with low number of reviews and mixed ratings about this shop.

I prayed for it to be good 'cos husbae wanted Mee Goreng all the way in West Coast and I was lazy to travel to the other side.

Went to order ""Mee Goreng + Bee Hoon, no taugeh, basah, and add mata lembu"". Came out less ""wet"" as I expected but I'm surprised it was as good as the one in West Coast. A lil' too salty for me but good enough and the portion is generous lah.

All in all. It was a good day to get this. I'm glad "
"Best soup kambing and mee goreng in Singapore. The standard of the soup kambing can sometimes be just above average but overall it is usually top notch. 7-8 out of 10 times, the mee goreng and soup kambing are absolutely the best that you can find in Singapore.

Better than Kallang, Adam Road or anywhere else.

Especially when served by the boss / son of the boss (taller, 40 something year old guy with a beard).

Very reasonable prices and the staff are friendly. Hygiene standards are good.

Hidden gem for the past 2 decades because of the location."
"On Tuesday 4 March 2025, I had the fried Hokkien prawn mee for my lunch at Fork & Spoon food court in Woodlands Mart, and I liked this meal as the fried Hokkien prawn mee tasted very delicious. Overall, the service provided to me was very good and I would love to try these other wok-fried dishes (except pork and beef) from this outlet in the future."
"Michelin star service rendered by stall owner, he insist that you sit down so that he can bring the noodles to your seat. Prawns are fresh and noodles cooked al dente. Sibeh Ho Jiak!!!"
Value for $.
"I don't usually post reviews but this is probably the worst prawn noodles I have eaten and i have eaten a lot. I don't get the good reviews for this.

Today I ordered the $5 version for the first time, asked for no beansprouts, it came with it, nvm. But the prawns were not fresh at all and mushy, the soup even tho was very dark in color and fragrant but when it's in my mouth, it tastes super bland.

Couldnt stomach it and didnt even finish half. Total waste of money."
"Nice comfort food, traditional flavour. My go to hae mee and location time and again for over a decade. Cheerful and fast service."
Very good bowl of prawn noodle soup. Haven't enjoyed such a good bowl in a long time 
Had the traditional prawn noodle with added pig tail.. nice.
"An old school prawn mee, for $4/-, quite a nice decent bowl of mee. I still prefer if they have the freshly fried shallots & pork lards to taste better. "
One of my favourite prawn noodle soup
"This is an old school prawn noodle stall. Very good mix of chili with the noodle serving in a traditional bowl that you won't find it often in hawker centres. I paid $5 for this meal.

I was disappointed by the freshness of the prawn and did not finished them. I would expect the high standard of prawn freshness in a prawn noodle stall."
Very tradtional bak ku prawn mee. Dry version taste good
Prawns were fresh. Chilli was alright though seems spicy.  $5 soup is good
"Classical bowl, not made to impress, but genuinely good.  something you can eat often and not get jelat."
Hands down the tastiest soup prawn mee this side of town.  $4.00 for a small bowl of noodles as of 19/3/23.  Criminally underrated.
Flavourful soup and fresh ingredients. Price is reasonable too!
"Had the $5.00 version on 29/10/22, was old-school & good, yummy."
"Good prawn noodle , portion is small"
"if you like prawn noodle dry with chilli, this store will be good. Doesnt get enough mention but taste good."
Old school prawn noodle that's been around for decades
3 ridiculously small prawns that can fit in a spoon of my prawn soup noodle.
"Very reasonable price. $3 for an average bowl of prawn noodles. Price aside, the portion is a little small for a full meal, but acceptable given the value. The regular prawn mee comes with two medium prawns, a few slices of lean pork and couple stalks of kangkong.

Overall quality is okay. The soup is not too heavy and has mostly prawn notes without the pork flavour. The dried noodles version with chilli is a little too salty for my liking.

If you're going to tabao the dry version, do remember to request for the soup. If you don't, you're not going to find it when you get home."
"Drop by after work for some little meal, saw this stall at das corner. Went to order a small bowl but adding topping. $5 for extra pig tail + rip"
Jing Ji Shi Hui
Good old bowl of prawn noodles
"Very old school, very nice broth...Open daily 3pm to 10pm"
"Rustic, old school prawn noodles. Soup was good and the dried noodles was well done!"
This stall has been around Dunman food centre for many years. This uncle has been running his stall alone. What I really like about his food is that his prawn noodle is that it is very rustic and old school. Its come in either soup or dry. Highly recommended!
"Visited 21 June 2025 Friday Afternoon. The following sharing are based on our unbiased personal opinion and experience

1st visit to this hawker center. The vegetarian stall caught my attention. Ordered a plate of Bee Hoon noodle with mixed ingredient with a add on egg top with curry gravy.

Wow my taste bud was awaken by a good plate of vegetarian bee Hoon. Curry gravy was really on point, bee hoon was the right texture.

Maybe I'm bias but I must give this elderly stall owner a good solid 4     for serving such delicious food.

Follow us for a gastronomic experience and discover the world finest in its purest form"
Very nice vegetarian food!
"Cheap and good vegetarian food with vegan options ( mostly less than $5 ). Food contains no alliums, hence suitable for religious vegans/ vegetarians. Enjoy your meal."
Very affordable vegetarian stall.
We really appreciate this stall very much.
"Great wok cooking skill by the lady boss, taste pretty comparable to another popular vegeterian stall name- Zhen Xiang that is on opposite road of this food centre. This stall opens till evening 8pm and they offer daily special dish. Blessed to have another quality vegetarian option at North."
"Aunty cooks really fast (usually done within 10min). Ingredients are generous and she doesn't skim on the condiments even though her price are affordable. I strongly recommend the mee goreng and kway teow for the wok hey that's so hard to find in other veg stores these days!! As a picky hokkien mee eater (most veg stores I tried, their yellow noodles have a distinct alkaline taste) but aunty managed to cook with well without that disgusting taste! Strongly recommend food here!!"
The food is absolutely delicious! Also very fairly priced and freshly made. The owners are also very helpful and kind. Would definitely recommend it.
Carpark entrance beside the petrol station is closed till further notice. Have to come in from the back and park at MSCP as the uncovered lots were greatly reduced due to construction
"The herbal Bak Kut Teh taste good.. not to strong herbal taste. BKT come with pork rib and tau po..

Soup can be refilled.. but they staff might ask you to bring the claypot over to refill or sometime they will bring the refill soup to you.

Price for claypot BKT $7.50.. per serving..

Serving still quite fast during dinner time coming 7pm..  waited for 10min and BKT was served to your table.."
They should renamed their salted veg to sweeted veg...
We love the herbal BKT here. The closest you can have that taste like Port Dickson BKT.
"Love the herbal Bakuteh here, the best i have tried. Kept coming back as I couldn't find any ones that are as good.

Have to add the intestines and fried beancurd skin!"
Good Bakuteh ! Hard to find carpark
"It's been quite some years since we last visited. I'm wondering if this is the same original seller? Quality dropped as compared to last time. When we arrive, there's no q, it's weird. U just order at the cashier, take a number stand, they'll bring the food to your table. Not going back, unless I just happened to be nearby."
salty and pricey. pity. last time was really good.
"Hong Ji Bak Kut Teh @ Marsiling serves black broth-style Bak Kut Teh, known for its rich, herbal flavor. The soup is fragrant and pairs well with tender pork ribs. Side dishes like braised tofu and peanuts add variety. Prices have increased recently, and the portion size is smaller compared to before, but the quality remains good, making it a worthwhile visit.

2  - Below Average: Needs improvement in multiple areas, not meeting expectations.
3  - Standard, Average: Meets basic expectations, nothing exceptional but acceptable.
4  - Standard, Above Average: Exceeds expectations slightly, better than the norm.
5  - Special & Unique: Outstanding experience, highly memorable and exceptional."
"Food was soso, bought the learn meat BKT and meat was tender, soup was okay but after eating almost half of my meal, I was greeted with a baby cockroach.  This is my first time writing a negative review.  Please check your soup before consuming."
"Order and they will bring the food to your table. tried to order from grab food but was cancelled after an hour wait. so i was there physically on a friday night, minimal wait time. soup was piping hot and goes well with the braised goodies and youtiao. soup pairs very well with white rice."
Tasty authentic bak kut teh. Excellent selection of side dishes which are also very authentic especially braised peanuts and salted veggies.
"Compared to the lunchtime rush, dinner here is much quieter, making it easy to find a table. Unlike at lunch, when you often have to wait for a seat before ordering, dinner offers a more relaxed experience.

The process is straightforward: place your order at the stall, pick up a number, and the staff will bring your food to the table. By 7:40 pm, the Youtiao was already sold out, but we enjoyed 2 individual portions of herbal bak kut teh, along with a side of vegetables and beancurd skin. Despite being labeled as a small portion, the beancurd skin was abundant.

The herbal bak kut teh came with 3 to 4 pieces of pork ribs and slices of mushroom. You also have the option to add extra ingredients like enoki mushrooms to your soup. Even in Singapore's hot weather, this dish is still incredibly satisfying to eat."
Cannot expect much for the atmosphere since it is in the coffee shop.
"More herbal BKT soup. $7.50 for 1 person portion. Around 4-5 piece of meat. You tiao disappointing.

Soup is okay, salty side.

The coffee shop is always v stuffy and hot. Not conducive to drink hot soup in the afternoon. I hope they would install big fans.

Jan 2025
Portion is the same. Food is okay. Still free to top up soup. Price is good, $22 for many items."
Not bad but usually it is hype when you see a snaking queue.
Quality drops. Soup not as tasty. A bit watered down. Meat also very hard. Compare to last time real off a lot. Will not be back again.
First time having herbal BKT. The herbal taste was not overly powering and the meat was quite tender. Had the you tiao too but it was cold and soft would skip this side dish. Overall the soup was still shiok!
Had the herbal pork slices soup and Kailan. Credible soup with strong herbal flavor. Kailan is adequately cooked for the right texture and taste.
"Portion shrunk amid price increases to 7.5! Taste still good but i feel ripped off because portion shrunk and price increased at the same time.
To me it has no value anymore, bah kut teh only 4 small piece, liver mixed kidney also less and small intestines same too. Whole meal 29.40 rather eat small store which has two big pcs of ribs, pork trotter and small intestines at 6.5 only."
"Bak kut teh tastes exactly like the one I had in Penang. Soup was flavorful and meat was tender. The ingredients were plentiful too. The good taste is evident by the long queue of MY and SG chinese early in the morning. 1 of the best bak kut teh I have tasted in SG. If you are craving authentic MY style herbal BKT without crossing the causeway, this is the place that you are looking for!"
Nice come here for herbal Bak Kut Teh. Ordered the mixed meat with added intestine and a bowl of salted vegetables as well as you tian. Yum.
The lady who takes order got ours wrongly. She is not very helpful and do not know how to recommend when asked. We asked for Tofu skinDou Fu Pi she gave us Tau Pok Dou Bu. The dishes are not bad but service needs to be improved
No WOW factor. Overcooked livers. Bitter Fen Chang. additional charge if you want enoki mushrooms. Can forget about the you tiao. Soup itself not bad though.
"Nothing beat a hot claypot of BGT during rainy dag.. First time trying out this stall, no queue, staff is friendly and guide us to order..

Soup is delicious, aroma is great, taste great.."
"The service was good, but the food tasted mediocre. The herbal broth was lacking, the meat was tough, and the salted vegetables were among the worst I've ever tried. The braised tau kee and tau pok didn't have the savory flavor they should have. The kidney was extremely hard; even though I requested it to be fully cooked, it turned out rock hard. I don't think I will return for the Bak Kut Teh. Also, the cost of three cans of soft drinks and a lcecube was $4.80. "
"Got an appointment in nearby tcm, the r&d nearby got any nice food. This bkt pops out. Went to try by ordering bkt spare part soup with you tiao. Soup base is dark color herbal taste not so rich. Definitely not white and spicy kind. Overall taste just slightly above average, try once is good enough."
"Many parking space available at Blk 7A MSCP. If you are coming here, can park there..."
"On the day we were there, the staff is very helpful and friendly. Must try their claypot bak kut teh. Not the more common peppery type of broth. The soup is more robust, with a slightly strong hint of herbs, but not overwhelming. The meat portions are quite generous too. Can try their braised pork trotters as well, quite good. The price is quite affordable. The menu clearly display the items and the prices"
"I love both herbal and peppery bak kut teh. Hong Ji BKT pork ribs is slow-cooked to perfection, boast tender and flavourful meat. Elevating the experience, dipping the succulent ribs into the chilli padi sauce enhances the overall deliciousness. The broth, herbal Bak Kut Teh is well-seasoned characterised by its clarity and balanced a rich herbal aroma, leaving a lingering and fragrant aftertaste in every mouthful. The aromatic herbal smell wafting through the air made it irresistible for us to wait! Served in a clay pot, this dish boasts a distinctive and uniquely tasty profile. "
"Value for money Malaysian style Bak Kut Teh.
Lots of ingredient and good for sharing with friends. However, the soup is not as herbal now compare to the past, suitable for people that like lighter tasting malaysian style bkt"

"Food is good,no service as it is in the coffee shop store, but no excuse as many other store or the zhi char store all have the service, if you want to top up the soup, you need to go to the store yourself"
Herbal smell thick soup but thirsty after finished e soup w 5 small pcs of Pork ribs. Liver is hard. Can eat if nearby won't travel all e way there again
"the food is good, but portion got smaller and price went up ..."
"Went during weekday at 1pm hence wasn't crowded. They able to customize order of Bak ku teh according to pax to share(3pax) and you can add more other dishes for sharing. Presentation looks good but liver soup wasn't that nice in my opinion & come with limited quatity of ""meat"".

Overall the meal was ok but they don't refill the soup like other famous BKT stores. Maybe it's herbal craypot style hence different practise. Total cost $48"
"Quick service even though there is a line. Most people in that kopitiam is ordering from this store.
Price is affordable as well. Soup is good, the flavour could have been more thicker and denser. "
"Overrated if you ask me. Paying $10 for a bowl here in Marsiling is absurd. Not that is bad but is just tastes like a BKT anywhere else. Saw raving reviews for this but I think when there is a hype from Singaporeans, it USUALLY is overrated. Great thing is that they serve the food and clear the bowls for you (not necessary so not sure if that's why they charge more).

Don't bother buying drinks at the drink stall cause they sell the worst coffee I've ever tasted in SG (does not affect my review of the BKT)."
The taste was herbish like M'sian BKT but lacked some flavour I can't put a finger on
"One of the best herbal BKT that I know of. Service was fast, the You Tiao is quite good, and the BKT never disappoints. The coffee shop can get quite hot though, especially on sunny days."
Standard drop a lot. The You Cai used to be good but now is so bland just like plain water. Disappointed. Not worth coming here anymore.
"Food Rating: 8-9/10. The soup is a good mix of herbal and peppery. The pork ribs are really tender, and the large intestines were really chewy while not being too gamey. The lean meat was tasty and great chewy texture as well. The bak kut teh sides were all great as well, less the you tiao which was a little soft and chewy when I would have preferred it crusty and crispy. The peanuts, braised tau pok and cai wei are very delicious.

Service: Very Good. There was a lady who was warm, friendly and helpful. Took our orders and really made the experience slightly better than a typical kopitiam trip."
"Perfect Bak Kut Teh, best in SG.
Broth is to die for!"
"Herbal Bak Kut Teh (BKT) isn't usually my preference, but I decided to try it due to its good Google reviews. The BKT was generous with the meat, and the herbal taste wasn't as strong as I expected. Overall, for someone who doesn't typically appreciate Herbal BKT, it was pretty good."
"Ordered $7 mixed pork plus 70cent rice.

Godly
Heat retention. Well is claypot lol. Still super hot even after all the phototaking and stirring. Keeping the taste of soup at optimum point.

Chili dark sauce. Spicy and elevated the taste of the pork.

Pros
Soup. Taste is not the strongest but it gets to you after it becomes cooler. But still enjoyed the more mild hot soup.

Bean curb. Nice addition normally not found in bkt. Soaked up all the soup to add dimensions to the dish.

Intestine, liver, bamboo are decent to good. But sauce just bring them to next level.

Meh
Pork rib. Quite heavy in porky taste. I am surprise since it is supposed to be herbal. And meat is tougher than it looks. Taste can always be help by the dark sauce. But not the texture."
"Great herbal bah kut teh, meat is tender no complaints."
Overall the BKT is ok  . One of the recommended herbal BKT in Woodlands estates.
Local food. I'm sure I will return again.
After the renovation they kept changing cooks. Very sadly the taste has never been the same again. And extremely inconsistent.
Nice herbal BKT!
"We use to eat at this stall for it popular Herbal Bak Kut Teh.  However after the renovation, they employed a few vietnamese staff and their attitude were very bad.  They speak so loudly and do not even know what we ordered thinking that they can speak Mandarin and very proud of it. Ended up our order was wrong.  Even asking for cut chilli they attitude was terrible. They smashed the red chilli padi and I was shocked cos it looks disgusting. Still prefer the whole sliced and not so messy after it being smashed. They rudely told me that it all the same.  I did request for a more tender meat of the pig trotter when ordering but she served me those are so hard and rubbery.  Told her about that then she say next time you must ask earlier. What a joke? I did mention when I am ordering but they seem to be rushing off to do their business. Eating oranges at the stall and playing on the handphone!  Too bad service and doubt I will patronise again. Still prefer those aunties that works in the morning which are more friendly."
"Easy to order, with plenty of pictures & descriptors for curious customers who might not know exactly what they want, being spoilt for choice. We took a table by the field and it was breezy & pleasant. Felt like we ordered a feast for 3 including drinks from a nearby stall and we paid $12 per person. Will definitely return."
"Herbal Bak Kut Tea in Singapore. Reasonable price, tastes nice."
"My go to for herbal bkt!!!! The price is not cheap for kpt, but I love the soup. Might have alot of msg hahaha"
"Hong Ji Herbs Bak Kut Teh at 19 Marsiling Ln offers a classic dish with their Malaysian style Herbal Bak Kut Teh which is a slow-simmered boiled herbal pork rib soup served with sliced button mushrooms, tau pok (dried beancurd puff) and fresh lettuces.

The Herbal Bak Kut Teh arrived piping hot, served in a clay pot bubbling with rich broth. The first spoonful revealed a complex blend of herbal flavors, with hints of ginseng, dang gui, and other traditional Chinese herbs. The broth was robust yet balanced, with a lingering warmth that enveloped the palate.

The pork ribs were tender and succulent, infused with the fragrant essence of the herbs. Each bite was a symphony of textures and tastes, with the meat effortlessly falling off the bone.

The tau pok absorbs the herbal broth like a sponge, bursting with juices and flavour with every bite.

Accompanying the main dish were sides of fragrant white rice and a spicy chili dip, adding depth and variety to the meal.

The service was prompt and friendly, with the staff serving the dish straight to your table.

Overall, Hong Ji Herbs Bak Kut Teh's Herbal Bak Kut Teh is a testament to the culinary prowess of Singapore's heritage cuisine. It's a must-try for those seeking a unique and satisfying dining experience. Whether you're a seasoned foodie or a curious traveler, this dish promises to delight the senses and leave you craving for more."
We had these prawn noodles for lunch at Teo Chap Bee eating house and is delicious with nice serving of the ingredients. The prawns are nicely sliced only cooked upon order and is price is reasonable. At $4 or the regular prawn noodle and $5 for prawn and pork ribs.
"Missing Malaysia bakuteh? This is consider good, worth a try. Food made with effort"
"Their Bak Kut Teh is very nice and popular, been here few times "
"soup tastes bland, don't know it's it because i only arrived after 7.30pm, where it's at its last legs.. added a 2 items and the bill comes up to a red note bill."

Quality herbal style soup at reasonable prices
"Very nice Bak Kut Teh, Rojak also great. Abit difficult to come if you don't drive"
"Fast service, tasty food and pocket friendly price."
Average food and not worth the price.
Nice herbal taste with lots of ingredients. Taste good on a hot afternoon and worth sweating out. Order and they will deliver to your table. Highly recommended 
Not normally a fan of herbal ba kut teh but this one was yummy! The braised pork was good too! 
"the food is no longer as nice as last time, bad customer service. ordered 3 person's share and they gave 2 sets of cutlery. when we asked for one more set the staff told us to take it ourselves in such a rude tone. the environment is also quite dirty, hot and stuffy. will not come back again."
"For Malaysian style Bak Kut Teh in Singapore...

This is as close as it gets to Kiang Kee in Kota Tinggi - which is the standard bearer for Malaysian style BKT in Peninsula Malaysia (surpassing those famous Klang Bak Kut Teh like Under the bridge and so on)

The soup cannot surpass Kiang Kee. But v close.
Meat quality is better than Kiang Kee though."
Favourite BKT at the north.
"Very nice herbal soup I love it so much. Small portions might not have much meat, but the meat is very tender."
Always eat their dry kway teow. Soup is flavourful.
Bad  disappointed
"nice food of prata, prawn noodles n bak ku teh"
Yummy herbal BKT.
Herbal soup are good not the heavy type.
"Been patronising this stall for many years,  one of the better herbal BKT in Spore ... of course not as good as those in KL. The salted vege is good, and big intestine is well cleaned,  cooked."
Place to go for Bak kut teh. Herbal type. Not the white peppery type
Overall if your craving for msia BKT but don't want to cross the bother. Look no further this place will satisfy your craving for a good msia BKT. Will definitely come back again. If you love having more soup freight not soup is refillable.
"Portion size was huge, the amount of peanuts was a lot for only $2. This is cheaper than Johor Bahru KSL's BKT. The soup was flavourful. Overall I would come back again."
"If you need a break from the SG pepper style BKT, this is the place to go! Reminds me of home."
"If you're tired of the usual white pepper variety, this is a refreshing option. The pig stomach soup not only boasts generous portions but also the owner's willingness to provide extra soup for takeout at no additional cost truly impressed me."
"The food was great. We had a normal Bak kut teh and Da Chang Tou. Waiting time is reasonable, only the place is very crowded and hot. Worth coming back again."
"This is prolly the best BKT I had in SG (IMO!). I'm from Malaysia, stay near to Klang which is the home to BKT in MY, I sincerely love Hong Ji's cause the broth is rich and herbal-ly, just they way I like it. But again, BKT is all about personal preference, if you prefer you BKT like how I do, then give Hong Ji a try cause the taste and ""feel"" definitely brings you back to Malaysia "
lacking in taste as compared to the ones in msia
"Good old traditional taste of 'dark' BKT..
Wld b crowded during peak hrs, bring along ur patience..
Service is relatively fast once u get ur orders in..
Tkx.."
"Amazing Bak Kut Teh! Loved it. After 5years, im back and the taste is amazing."
A must try.
Good Herbal Bak Kut Teh
"Singapore style coffee shop environment with great food. The herbal soup is great and the portion is very sizeable. We ordered for 4 pax portions and it's comfortable for 5 adult and 1 kids.

Recommended if you are around the area, don't missed this traditional great taste."
Authentic herbal Bak Kut Teh
"the room for improvement for customer service is bigger than a corner unit landed property.
Went on 10 June 2023 ~1pm,
Ordered a number 1 with mian xian. Cashier with red headband charged me $8.8 and when I showed her the transaction she didn't tell me the amt was wrong, she overcharged me.

Fast fwd 10-15mins I went to ask another server and they told me my order should be $8.5, also when my food arrived, they gave me number 2 instead 1.
Here comes the worst customer service you will face
Cashier lady with red headband come and say "" I clearly heard you say number 2""
At this point, I'm totally speechless, give wrong order still can bicker with customer. Moreover, all my friends heard me ordered 1 and only this cashier lady insisted I ordered 2 
Still got the cheek to ask me hear and speak clearly, customer service at its best?

FYI, i don't eat liver I order number 2? What joke is this. Waste of food in the end (see picture)

EDIT: my friend actually know the boss and help me to feedback back. Boss acknowledged, apologised on behalf of the worker and said this won't happen again. Nice boss, at least boss won't bicker with customer"
Standard is dropping. Taste is worse off these days.
"worst customer service ever, teach your workers to listen orders w ears open, not closed."
"It was good until it became popular. Soup lacks flavour. Seems like they can't keep
Up with the demand. Service can be better."
"Great bowl of prawn mee.
Soup is superb, can taste the sweetness of prawn, lots of effort went into it.

Park lard and scallions was an excellent combination.

Ordered the 2 in 1 for $5, very reasonable price compared to other famous prawn mee shop of equivalent standard."
"The Bak Kut Teh comes with alot of soup. I felt this one do not have taste of herbs compared to Johor Bahru's Bak Kut Teh. But still tastes good.
Located in coffee shop where the fans are not that strong"
We always come here for Bak Kut Teh but this time Pork rib is a bit hard.
Great Tasty Food
"Yummy Bak Kut Teh from this unassuming coffeeshop in Marsling. This is the ""Herby"" style; but not over-powering. For $14, we got a medium bowl to be shared by 2, with abt 10 pieces of meat."
"$7 for 1 person with 4-5 meaty but tender pork ribs with just enough juicy fat. Value for money.
For those who don't like the soup to be too herbal, I think this version is a very good choice; hearty but not too herbal or salty.
Second time here and enjoyed the salted veg and peanuts the last visit too."
"Pork Rib Prawn noodle came with 3 pieces of tender pork ribs and 3 halves of medium sized prawns which were fresh.

Noodle was well coated with homemade chili and stock. A customary accompaniment of water spinach and beansprouts.

Soup was of flavorful but not a punch-in-your-face version.

The lady was very helpful and friendly who was accommodating for a soup refill. Reasonably priced."
The standard and style of bak kut teh is different from years ago. Not sure if owners have changed. Quality was ok but underwhelming compared to the last time I tried years ago. Pig trotters not that good.
Xia Mian Gei Ren Jia Chi Duo Yi Dian. 
No such restaurant- changing hand
strong herbal and deliciously favored soup. Preparation is fast and you get your food ready in less than 10 minutes after the order is placed. Some level of self service is required. Overall good food at a reasonable price.

"It's not the peppery type, but flavourful herbal soup base. And there's free top up of soup. You are also free too add on any condiments to customise your soup. Was told it's the authentic Malaysian style. Yummy!

Tiktok: gohht13"
"bak kut teh broth was very flavourful, braised pig trotter was just okay. for the sides we got, the preserved vegetables were not bad but the you tiao wasn't very good. i would come
by again if i was in the area, but i wouldn't make a trip specially to this place since it's quite ulu"
Hard to find a place to sit.
Delicious herbal BKT. The meat were really fresh. Braised intestines and pig trotters were really good too. Soup is refillable.
Hen Hao Chi Hen Zheng Zong De Rou Gu Cha 
Herbal type BKT.... Meat is tender
"Herbal BKT. I think taste is pretty ok, but it's not that cheap and they don't top-up the soup (I've not tried asking for more soup)."
"good decent bah kut teh. im comparing to the ones i ate in klang, Selangor. Malaysia"
"Nice bak kut teh!!! Must try!! Their soup is a sweet soup , sweet herb soup. The meat is fresh and the price is reasonable  Chi Wan Huan Jia Tang,Hen Hao Chi Hen Tui Jian! Huan Hui Zai Lai!"
"Good herbal based bkt, comes with 4 ribs, some mushrooms+vege and taupok.

Meat comes off easily also, pair well with the spicy dark soy sauce. The tau kee side dish for $2 is too little."
"One of the better bkt in the north. Definitely no the nicest until you have to travel all the way from the other end to try.. but if you are in the area then sure, give it a try. Its comfort food in the cold weather for people staying in the area.
More of the blacky herbal kind. My soup was not herbal enough so more could be better. If you like clam then remember to add on, not inside by default."
Highly recommend this bak kut teh to everyone also their boss should plan open other outlet
"Under the same BKT stall name, I Bought and enjoyed a bowl of prawn noodle soup, I liked it"
The amount of likes and positive reviews speaks volume of the BKT quality. Personally it's a stall where I would patronising if I'm nearby.
Soup like water!
"When I was working with my clients around Woodlands area, I always come by to eat at this coffee shop particularly Hong Ji BKT.

This version is the herbal style and have ribs or mixed innards variant. Usually I only ordered 1 bowl of ribs as ordering another dish such as pork trotter will be too filling for me.

There many ingredients such as vegetables, mushrooms, pork ribs itself. If looking for pepper version, go elsewhere.

I will say it's like Klang style of BKT of course with Singaporean flavor.

The crowd is usually very pack especially during lunch or dinner time. Today I went around 2pm and there are many spare tables for me to choose.

The lady staff serving me was chatty and customer orientated. Good customer service! After ordering your dishes, you take. Number stand and place at the table where the staff will bring the dishes to you."
Came here for brunch as recommended by friends. Hot and freshly serveda little taste of Malaysian standard. Very satisfying.
Their soup was delicious! Good packaging and still hot when delivered
"Foods very nice n delicious,  many customers queue up to order foods"
"3rd visit after relocated to Woodlands for almost 2 years. The soup base from this stall is slightly on the sweet side, not too bad. However, we preferred white soup base with loads of pepper (those sold in Song Fa, but then SF BKT is expensive)."
Price increased to $6.50 now for most dishes. Yet to try if the taste maintain high standard.
"This version of bak kut teh is more blacky herbal taste. Not the typical Singapore style peppery pork soup. Claypot just keep the soup warm longer. For the regular bowl of $6.50 includes everything (ribs, tau pok, mushroom & intestines) I would say it's quite decent portion for the price with the current inflation economy. It's situated in non air cond food court so be prepared to sweat a bucket while enjoy. You can except a longer queue time if they are at their peak time for lunch and dinner."
"Very busy during lunch time, not much place to sit."
"Herbal soup Abit too strong, but nice. The braise pork is nice, but meat too fat. Taste better when it's hot"
Nice herbal bak kut teh.. love it with the mian xian.. nice owners helped to make table reservation for us as we were in a rush.. Portion and price is good too..
"Standard dropped compared to before covid period. Malaysia herb style bak kut teh, sufficient to cure your craving in Sg instead of going Malaysia to have it."
"New review: they added pepper into the herbal bkt so it ain't good anymore

Old review: Craving for good Bak Kut Teh but don't want to go to Malaysia to have it? Look no further! The North has your back for herbal BKT. Yes, you need to travel to the North but it's worth your time. Feast on the best (personally) the best herbal BKT in SG. Your stomach will feel so satisfied."
"Wei Dao Bu Cuo,Hao Chi"
Think standard has dropped and become more ex. will not go there to eat purposely unless happened to be nearby
Marsiling treasure
"It's so hard to find good herbal BKT in singapore, so much so that I drove all the way here from the east to have BKT!

Loved the broth, as well as the tenderness of the meat. The rice was good and fragrant as well."
Very nice bah kut tea. Portion was generous.
Nice chunky rib pieces. Very tasty dark style soup
"Above average Bah Kut Teh. Order the mixed Bak Kut Teh. The broth is perfect for rainy weather. Warm one's up. Pork ribs, liver cuts and intestines is done right. Customer service experience is excellent"
good fast services. Price is still same despite inflation.
"Mix and match $26.00, portion for 3 person, soup taste still the same as 5yrs ago. But unable to find wholesome garlic like last time  n mushrooms slice seem getting thinner"
"Getting worst over the years. Bland soup, tough meat."
Not A Bad Choice Of Malaysia Style Bak Kut Teh I Would Preferred Than Leong Kee (Klang) Ones 
Still one of the best bak kut teh out there.
Simple and nice.
"Find it average bowl of bkt only despite the queue. Need to wait ard 15mins during lunch weekday crowd.

The broth taste ok leaning towards bland. The portion is alittle small but it cost total of $7.20 w rice.

Not worth money or effort to come. Find the amk branch slightly better."
First time buying here. Really Bad Service & Attitude. NO MORE NEXT TIME. Other outlet service very good. Surprised!!!!
Love it. Price is reasonable. The taste is not too strong. And the portion is pretty big.
Tasty soup but some pork ribs very tough.Portion was reasonable.Rice quality was good .
Best bak kut teh in town
Still one of my fav BKT stall!
"Very tasty should include serving Chinese tea. After it is bak ku teh, where is the teh?"
The prawn noodle not bad.
"May 2022. A bowl of claypot innards goodness costs $6.50. Pleasantly fragrant with herbal soup mix.
Very popular stall, so go early to avoid the lunch hour crowd."
"The food is good and authentic but the hawker hygiene is really bad saw ants and maggots on the table before our food is here, appetite got turn off but too hungry to care."
"Rou Gu Cha Bu Cuo,Hei Tang Yao Cai Liao Zu. Mei Qu Ma Lai Xi Ya Chi,Zhe Li Jie Jie Chan Ye Shi Bu Cuo De Xuan Ze.

"Pretty good claypot herbal BKT, place crowded during lunch or dinner time difficult to find seats."
"My favourite herbal BKT .
Patronising for more than 10 years
Beside BKT , recommend also braised pig trotters. Prepare for long queue"
fantastic dishes for families and friends
The best bak kue teh i always patronise....

"Delicious Claypot Bak Ku Teh with friendly service!

Had the large serving of mixed BKT which included cut pork ribs, pork liver, intestine and stomach. The broth was savoury and slightly herbal, yet maintaining the light clean taste that doesn't overpower your palate.

Recommend the braised pork trotters as well. We had the veggies, braised egg, you tiao and peanuts along w rice.

Very pleasant experience placing order and the uncle serving is very friendly. Looking definitely return in the the future!"
"Cheap and delicious herbal bak kut teh! Lives up to expectations to being rated 3/3 stars in Food King. Best to eat this dish with iced drinks as the coffee shop is quite humid and hot especially after drinking the refillable hot soup. Totally worth looking specially for this bak kut teh! Highly recommended! :)

Edit: The youtiao is, nowadays, a tad too chewy for my liking. Other Bak Kut Tehs serve much better youtiao. Their rice is also not well-cooked. Maybe some prefer it this way, but I like my youtiao plump, crispy & soft like ""Old Street BKT"", and my rice moist and soft. Minus off 1 star from initial 5 stars. Still tasty, but wouldn't specially travel there to eat this anymore."
"Long queue as always. If u are keen to wait, it's worth it. Malaysian style clear soup type. All time favourite. Average wait min 20mins. The pig trotters is pretty good too. Dine-in, extra soup is free"
"Easily 1 of the best herbal BKT around. Price are reasonable. Taste is good. Serve in claypots.
My wife and I have a long history with this BKT, from the days that we just know each other till today we have children. Even our children loves it.
Take note: the coffeeshop seats and carpark space are quite limited, so try to go during off-peak hours."
Used to be nice but taste not as good as before. But seems is better than going other places for bak kut teh in woodlands
"Neighbourhood delicacy, and must try. Ordered mixed Bak Kut Teh with extra Yew Tiao."
"Came on a Saturday around 1pm, service was good and didn't have to wait too long.

Ordered the herbal BKT soup, braised pig trotters, peanuts, youtiao and meesua. Herbal
BKT soup had a very mild herbal taste; love how soft the meat was but the soup wasn't able to satisfy my cravings for herbal BKT. Braised pig trotter was a really generous serving of meat which was really tender too but the star anise taste was too strong. Peanut and youtiao are what you would normally expect it to taste like. Mee sua was pretty good though, I would say the Mee sua soup was somewhat more flavourful than the BKT soup.

Not a place I would specially travel to for BKT cravings."
Nice foods
"Other than the authentic and delicious Klang style BKT, their staffs are very polite."

Satisfying BKT especially in cold weather
Located at a windy part of north Singapore
With the Malaysia JB vibes
Very cooling and interesting part of Singapore

This is our go to bak kut teh herbal style
Ordered a lean meat bkt for $6
Also ordered a pig kidney mee sua for $5.50
Loved the mee sua and the herbal soup
Lean meat was also alot!
Must eat with tau kee for $2

Warms your soul
Prepare to wait for awhile as it is crowded

They have been around for 24 years"
Not that good as what it claimed
Very nice to eat
"Soup arrived hot and cloudy. Not a heavy herbally kind of soup. Cuts of meat used are lean and still tough. Not falling off the bone like soft. Stewed trotter was heavily flavored of star anise instead of dark soya sauce. Again trotter was still tough as well.

Good value at these prices and staff were very friendly."
"Got malysia vibe, very settling to eat there. Only thing is that is always crowded during peak hours or Weekend"
"Always packed and i believed its a good sign... and we have to settle for ""Downstairs"" instead. Lolz."
Very good taste
No comment
My usual Herbal Bak Kut Teh place. Sadly it's closed today at 7pm when I came by.
"One of my go to comfort food place;)
Refillable soup. Yummy!"
Good and clean hygiene place
"We had their herbal soup with just ribs and pork trotter plus you tiao.

The trotter was good and soft that the meat and skin falls off easily.

Not so much for the pork ribs unfortunately. I was hoping that it would just fall off a bit easier. Having said that, the meat is still good and flavourful cos of the soup.

To the soup, it's the good ol' Malaysian herbal style which is great. You get the herbs infused into the meat of course.

I gave it 4* cos I'm comparing it to the those especially in Klang. And also 4* cos if the meat had fallen off easily, I'd give it 5*."

Good Malaysian styled bak kut teh. Good value. But can be quite inaccessible unless you are driving
ALL ABOUT MSG.
"When on Saturday, the coffee shop is fully pack it very had to find a seat. The business there is good! May due to nice food selling in the house. Give it a try."
Nice and tasty. Definitely worth the trip to Marsiling!
Nice herbal flavour for the soup. Pork liver tend to be overcooked. Better order for medium for 2 persons rather than 2 individual portions. Don't forget to patronise the seafood soup stall in the same coffee shop.
"Overall the food is above average. And, we can request to have our soup topped-out during our meal. Will definitely come back for next visit"
Best bak kut teh in the Woodlands area.
One of the best herbal BKT in Singapore!
I see i never eat
Get to select few variations of claypot bak kut teh. It's slight herbal flavour and meat are tender. Order and they will deliver to you.
"Good hot soup for a chilly, rainy morn. For me just a slight too salty. Pork ribs could be more tender......"
Nice soup.
"Ordered 2 pax herbal bak kut teh along with a plate of you tiao and veggies (can't recall the name sadly). Overall taste was great. Price was quite affordable too! Would imagine that the food would taste even more shiok if I wasn't there on a hot afternoon.

Would recommend for all to come and try. May need to be prepared to wait abit for seats."
"Simplify, mild herbal style of #BakKutTeh soup mixed with pig liver, stomach, pork rib, mushroom is pure shiokness! You can add ingredients like beancurb skin and shroom etc if u want also. My personal fav to satisfy my herbal #BKT crave!"
Not bad still i enjoy it
"The bak kut teh is nice. For those who are near this area, please try. They have different variety. You may want to try the prawn noddle stall beside as well. These combination of dishes is fantastic..."
This is my first time visiting this stall. The Bak Kut Teh taste not really fantastic but acceptable only.
"Good bak kut teh is in the meat, the soup and in my case, also in the accessories like big intestines, puffy beancurd etc. The meat is ok. Not too dry or stiff. But it's diced into miserly, pathetic cubes. I'm not eating teppanyaki dice wagyu beef. I'm eating bak kut teh. And you need to sink your teeth into those meat and let that meat detach from the bone. Without that, there's no satisfaction. The soup is ok. But it is not the peppery kind with essences of garlic melted as one with the soup. Neither is it the herbal, black kind with waft of medicinal herbs blended just nice with cinnamon, star of anise and the spices. A bak kut teh with no hint of aspiration and i would say, disappointment for those like me who travel long and far for the name and fame of this bkt."
One of the most  varieties bahkuteh dishes for the Northern side of Spore ..taste not bad tbough
Malaysia taste

"A tasty trotter with a bowl of herbal bak ku soup.
Meaty ,soft pork trotter with herbs. Very worth of money, only $5 + $0.50 for a plain bowl of rice.
The stall beside with the same name, selling Prawn noodles, taste good too,with pork lard make the piping hot soup noodles nicer."
Nice Malaysian style bkt
"Definitely one of the most authentic KL/Penang bak kut teh I've tried in SG! (Ya, there is a diff from the Klang thick herbal one)
Ordered the pork knuckle as well, quite nice as well and in a very generous portion!
2 person with one BKT, big portion of pork knuckle, you char kuih, veggies and 2 rice ----only $23! Very worthy!
*** Great service with refillable soup - uh la la, my cravings for BKT soup was fixed!!!"
Good almost like kelantan Bak kUT TEA
"Delicious and fuss free herbal BKT  decent portion for 1pax.
Came by for lunch on a Sunday afternoon, there was a queue but service was fast."
"Love the herbal bak kut teh, just like Malaysian klang style BKT and affordable in SG."
Rou Gu Cha Yue Lai Yue Mei You Wei Dao Liao.  Bu Zhi De Chi
Pretty decent for herbal pork rib and innerts. Similar to the one in jb opp ksl. Buttt I refuse to call this bak kut teh. Up to you to decide. Worth trying.
This is the Drastically Dropped  Standard  . Now just going For (Name Sake) . A waste of going there as others are much more better then them.  Sigh.
Worth the trip
Best Bah Ku Teh in Singapore
Alternative choice for Malaysia style bak kut teh
"1)Foods were ok but can't compared to first started.
2)Prices are on the high side compared to hawker centres foods.
3) Car park were few and usually crowded when dining time....."
Nice food . Authentic traditional BKT. Value for money
"the stall at yishun 632 really very bad, soup is no good, no herb at all and tasted sour.. and 4 little pc of meat?????

been eating at marsiling for many years.. still the best there.. but not other branches"
Prawn noddle not bad
Chi De Guo
Flavourful herbal broth. One of the better BKT in SG.
"Other than their popular BKT store, they also served pretty good prawn noodles right beside the BKT stall.

You can add abalone, pig stomach, intestines and other ingredients."
"Nice n strong Hokkien style herbal Bak Kut Teh. The smell n taste stays in your mouth for a bit, while u enjoy the soup. Meat is chunky too. Nice one."
"Good hot comfort food, especially on a rainy day. But owner should do something about the huge rat roaming around, and not be amused and nonchalant about it. Would have rated 5*  otherwise.  Just hope the rat never Jia Liao. "
"I'm quite the fussy Bak Kut Teh person, but this place really serves one of the best Bak Kut Teh in my opinion!
The ""broth"" is dark, herbaly and it made me happy having it:)"
My favorite bak kuk teh. Very crowded during peak hours.
Great Bak Kut Teh. Located in remote area of Marsiling but crowded as alway
"So far the only bkt shop at SG that hits the spot for me. Agree with previous reviews to come later and avoid lunch hour. The waiting time is shorter.
Prices are reasonable and the soup is herbal and nice!"
A reasonable priced Bak ku tae place. Food is good....
"Food is as per usual. But attitude of the cashier is very bad. Went to order take away, and because we are all wearing mask now, I especially highlighted twice that it's a take away order, in case she couldn't hear me clearly. I took the number stand and stood right at the stall front to wait for my order. Ended up order was prepared for dine in. I told the cashier I ordered for take away, first thing she said was ""take away never say take away"". Other staff was apologizing to me while the cashier just looked on, not a word of apology from her."
Good breakfast for Sundays! Malaysia styles bkt. Delicious.
Still OK bkt I eaten in Singapore. Don't compare it with Malaysia.
"very delicious, got Malaysia bak kut teh taste"
"Varieties of local pork delicacies. It'll be good to enjoy with friends or more people, so that you can order lots of dishes to taste them. Sorry waiting time."
"By far the best herbal Bak Kut Teh I have eaten. Cheap and generous with the ingredients. The soup served super hot, drink with care. The kopitiam seat quite limited, so got to wait around for seat. The pretty waitresses serving the food is quite observance, will provide additional cutlery / bowl before you even ask for it.  it will be good if is air-con. After eating, alway sweat non stop."
Bak Kut the n fish soup there is nice
Herbal soup taste is nice
Still the best bkt I eaten in Singapore. Don't compare it with Malaysia side.
"It has been more than a year since I had these herbal bak kut teh.  Still the same good herbal taste. However hot weather eat this, hot. Perspired like mad,  so 4 stars."
"Dark soup with herbs. Not the white type. Depends on individual on soup type. In my opinion, it taste good. You can choose either
1. Pork ribs only or
2. Mixed version ( meaning pork ribs and pork intestines etc)

Side dishes I prefer:
1. Braised peanuts
2. Braised intestines (Lu Chang Fen)

For the lighter taste:
1. Braised tau-ki ( bean strips - sorry I forgot the correct words)

Avoid weekend lunch crowds. Go earlier or later after lunch. Staff will cook better"
Nice herbal BKT
"Quality BKT at cheap prices.

You can't expect m'sia standards but its pretty darn close. Crowds is something to accept but I'd come back anytime if I can't get to m'sia.

The sour is savory yet not overly salty as well!"
Very flavourful and comforting BKT that is unique for its Hokkien-style herbal taste that is very inviting. Prices were reasonable and the pork was succulent and fresh. They will also refill your soup upon request. Only thing is location is a bit out of the way but they have other branches.
"Soup is good but bit spicy. Paikut is generous even for 1 person portion. Price is reasonable atv$6. Taste similar to the one in Jurong point, but JP ones meat are softer. Overall good."
One of my favourite bah kut teh outlet. This is dark soup BKT which is herbal and sweet. The vegetable and beancurd compliments well. The stewed pork trotters is nice and tender. Recommended.
"The taste is not consistent, sometimes is nice ,sometimes not so nice"
"Excellent Bak Kuh Teh at very reasonable prices. A quick glance across the coffee shop would tell you all you need to know about the presence of this stall - the coffee shop exists for the sake of this stall.

Long queues, stuffy environments, and a struggle to find seats is typical in the Singapore scene for good food, and you'd find that all over here.

While the Bak Kut Teh is the main star of the show, you won't be disappointed when order its accompanying side dishes, such as the braised intestines (both small and large), as well as other kinds of soup dishes (like pig tail soup).

Expect to shell out between $8-12 per person - it'll definitely be worth your time and money."
Herbalicious BKT! This is probably the closest Malaysian stye Bak Kut Teh taste you can find in Singapore
Great Malaysian style Bak Kut Teh
Rou Gu Cha. Hao Hao Chi You Jing Ji. 
For the price and the casual setup. Best claypot BKT you can find around North.
"Taste was good, but service bad ."
Revisit one of my favorite bak kut teh since covid. But the soup today for lean meat like this. Unlike the usual one.
"In this particular stall, there is the infestation of rodents n roaches n lizards around the stall n the stall holder is very dirty n they only concentrate on doing business n making money !! NEA officers hv time n again been sent there to spotcheck the cleanliness n upkeep of all the stalls n to impose summons on them should there be any lapses found !!"
I give the 3 star
"i believe many reviews have already elaborated how good their soup is, so i won't be reviewing their dishes. their dishes are great. however, there's one thing you should take note when thinking of eating here: seating is VERY LIMITED and the amount of orders is a lot. it isn't an understatement to say that waiting times during lunch peak period can be an hour. hence, plan your journey early and order early (and get someone to find seats while you queue)."
Fu Wu Bang
It was my second time to patronised this Bak Kut Teh.  The stall uses rib which is easier to rid of the full meat.  The rib was tendered and the sides tasted nice.  The nuts were sweet and the portion is big for a bowl at $1.  Queue may be long but they will serve the food to your table after ordering.
"Probably the closest in terms of taste for Bak Kut Teh which I think can make me think of the ones you can find in Malaysia. Servings are rather small (as compared to other BKT servings) but I think that's just great because you can order more side dishes! Do get the braised tofu, braised eggs, and of course the youtiao. The pork knuckle is quite nice too, I'd say it's worth a try. Soup is refillable  and it's delicious! Price is reasonable too! Would recommend to try this at least once!"
Always a fan of this bak kut teh
Nice to eat in Singapore

Different with traditional BKT. Not plenty of garlic and white pepper and tastes very good with herbs. Price is fair.
Average coffee shop with great food. Don't forget to try the Bak Ku Teh and seafood soup
Nice Bak Kut Teh. Just mostly not enough space to dine in on the peak hours
"sometimes nice, sometimes so so. :D

Recommended"
"Good Malaysian BKT but once in awhile, it loses it touch but still one of my favorite BKT place"
Love it! Their soup taste so nice and good portion are big and price are reasonable. Will definitely visit again!

Delicious Herbal Bak Kut Teh. Hard to find parking lot or seat inside during lunchtime
Very strong herbal bkt taste and delicious like the one in malaysia.. Worth to wait. $5.50.
"Super taste,  fast and reasonable"
Must try BKT
Awesome herbal bkt in Woodlands area.
Food was ok. The herbal was just nice. Not salty. The only issue is getting a table. Inside table can only sit a max of 3 pax due to covid19 restrictions. During peak hours u will have to wait a long time for not only a table but for the food as well
A great place for herbal bak ku teh. Opens at 8am ...go with friends and order a big one. Served quickly and with love. Meat is tender and soup is good

Very Good!
"Delicious. Towards the end it got a little too salty but it's ok. Reasonable price. Cai Wei is too bland, that could be better."
"Tasty herbal soup. A tad pricey for what you get at $5.5 a bowl - around 4 pieces of pork rib (half the length of your typical BKT rib), a few slices of button mushroom, around 4 pieces of bite-sized tau pok."
"The herbal soup is super tasty. They are generous in presenting their portion. Price is also relatively cheap. Be careful not to order too much. The soup during first serving is not enough. We asked for a top up and it is free of charge. However we are expected to walk to the stall to collect the soup ourselves. They don't provide the top up service. While the soup is tasty, it must be noted the herbs used can cause heatiness to the body overnight. So enjoy the soup in moderation. The pork knuckle costs only $5 and the portion is big and delicious too."
One of the better places to get the herbal style broth. Prompt service and great value for money.
"Long queue as usual. Tasty but as always, portions shrink when the popularity increases. Very polite stall assistants jeep customers coming back for more. Best avoid lunch time."
"Crowded, but the waiting time is acceptable."
Bak kut Teh stall is busy at lunch hour. Tasty and average pricing.
Closest bak kut teh compare with those a bridge away.
"Have been eating from this stall for many years. Soup is nice and pork ribs are tender. Unfortunately, the bean curd strips (Braised dao Kee) we had last night was found to have a dead baby cockroach. This is the 2nd time I experienced cockroaches in their braised dao Kee. And worst, saw a rat running underneath their stainless steel cabinets."

nothing to shout about. is just normal and hard to get sit especially during weekend. its bkt smell better than it taste.
"BAD Lot of RATS running around outside and inside the food stall.
NEA should do a routine check please......"
"1st time trying the Bak Kut Teh and indeed it's very nice and price reasonably. We ordered a 3 person portion with 4 white rice together with one pig trotter, 2 you tiao, 1 tofu skin and fried beancurd skin total $29.50. The soup is awesome and pig trotter is very soft and tender. Do prepare to queue during lunch hour. A hidden gem in Marsiling Lane."
"Meat was fresh and tender, rice was fluffy, tau kee was soft, and soup got nice herbal taste without the bitter aftertaste. But I felt that msg was abit too much as felt thirsty after meal. Will still recommend!"
Flavorful bkt.
"Second time here. This time had a good taste of this herbal pork ribs soup. Tried the mixed pig's parts: intestines, bellies, livers and ribs. The meat tasted fresh and tender. The soup was full of herbs taste but not bitter. The vege and the mushrooms added into the soup are a triple plus and that's what the original should look like. Also added kailan in oyster sauce and youtiao to compliment the hearty lunch. If you find the soup is not enough, can request to add more."
The frozen ribs and meat cooked over more time. I don't like it. Not fresh and seems like suitable for old people.
Never disappoints. Love it!
"The herbal ones are harder to find in Singapore, with a famous one being at Marsiling. I know Jalan Kayu has one too, called Soon Huat, and that's the one I go to often since it's nearer to me.

This one is not bad, with decent taste of the herbs. Pork ribs are tender too"
Excellent taste
Pretty Good .. soup is refillable. malaysia style .. not Teochew pepper soup
Best bak kue teh I had after a long time 
Nice Malaysia style BKT.
Rich herbal taste.
"Not bad, soup unlimited refueling."
Soup base standard slightly drop not dark tasty before and the stew braised pig trotter too sweet a little.
So so. Still prefer the authentic Malaysian herbal Bak Kut Teh. There's usually different cuts but here it's mainly pork ribs.
"Malaysia style bak kuk teh , the pork knuckle one of the best"
Nice bak ku teh soup & seafood soup
Amazing Malaysian style bkt. Love this place!
Soup very tasty.
The soup is alittle pepperish. For those who love lots of pepper it's good.
Very popular herb bak kuh the at Singapore
One of the best Bah Ku Teh around in Sg and it is very good that they allow customers to refill soup once. The ribs are chopped into smaller pieces and makes it easier for us to eat and ribs are tender and more fatty. The soup is herbal and yet not overpowering. Will definitely come back again.
Other than price abit high its good deal
"Love their soup here. It tastes better at night since it's been cooking for a longer time. Most of the time the braised intestine is sold out when I reached. Would give them a 5* but many times my order got mixed up by the cashier.

Once I ordered liver soup, they gave me kidney soup.

Another time I ordered mixed innards without pig stomach but it came with pig stomach."
Very good but expensive...
Popular bak kue teh in Woodland
Food was good and cheap
Delicious Bak Kuet Teh with reasonable price
Food alright and price is reasonable but super busy and need to queue up for at least 30 minutes to order your food. Challenging to find seats. Personally I think not worth the wait for the food.
Good Bak Kut tea and taste is very good! Staff are friendly price reasonable
"Regardless if MSG is added,  this is my favourite Bak Kuh Teh. Hard to find herbal soup Bak Kuh Teh nowadays."

Rich herbal broth cook in individual claypot. It's as good as going over the causeway to have but more balance and u do not need to stuck in causeway just to enjoy the Malaysian style bkt goodness
Nice taste of herbal and tender meat. Would recommend people who love herbal bkt to try. This is also the second visit from a person staying in the east and it was worth the travel. Would recommend to try the tao kee as it has a very nice braised flavour and they braised till the texture is quite soft.
Wonderful bkt...
"Strongly recommend this Bak Kut Teh for those that like the more herbal type of soup. Serve piping hot in a claypot, the store allows various combinations of ribs and pork innards. Braised pork trotters were also great, with generous portions of meat (fish soup is from different store but also strongly recommended)."
Stall located in Eating House at Marsiling Singapore . Crowded during lunch time
"Nice bak kut tea, but the person taking orders is rather impatient. Still worth the wait nonetheless."
Traditional
"Good food, long queue."
Saltish though..but taste herby & good

My no.1 choice bah kut teh.Love the herbal taste.
One of the best BKT.
This Bak Ku Teh is a distinctive flavor on its own. Not the usual pepper BKT u usually gets outside.
Food was only so so.
4 stars. Yes... 4. I have finally tried it yesterday. The fragrance is OK but taste of the herb not as robust as I expected. Its still OK. Unique. Good
The rice is undercooked. Soup was alright
"Nice, herbal soup"
"As many have mentioned here.. this is the hidden gem located at Marsiling where you can try the herbal type of ba kut teh. I prefer the herbal type as it can really taste the authentic of it. There are types you can choose. The combination of pork rib, pig stomach, pig intestines, liver and kidney.. sinful?? The meat is tender and the soup was tasty too. I love the braised intestines and stewed salted vege are the best. However the braised tofu skin is so so.. go earlier before the lunch crowd as there are limited seats around..Super yummy!"
Only if you like herbal. Fresh ingredients used.
"Soup was flavorful, portion wasn't huge though"
Just as good as before

Love the herbal style of Bak Kut Teh that is usually harder to find in Singapore. The pork ribs are tender but the soup is not as herbal as expected.
Food was consistent and delicious.
One of the place where nice herbal Bah Kut Teh sold.
Got to say one of the best secrets of woodlands. Food is very tasty. Sadly the serving size is getting smaller.
My favourite BKT
"Worth to try Bah Kut Teh, give them a chance "
Good taste
Good food!!!
Popular stall in Marsiling serving pork ribs with soup in claypot. Usual variety of side dishes and stewed pork knuckle. Packed at lunchtime
"Served good bak kue teh. Price are reasonable, depends on your order my family of 6 spent about $60 for a main bak kue teh, plus 5 side dish( average $5) except of the braised trottles. Place is windy for outdoor seating, indoor can get stuffy if fully packed."
Love the herbal taste of the bkt soup. Shiok!!!
"I was dining at this stall earlier at 8pm.To be honest,it has shown tremendous improvement on its soup taste after my last visit some 3yrs plus back.The number of times i had eaten from this store can be counted by 1 hand,with 1 finger balance.Its bah kut(ribs) arent really well flavoured,as compared to other stalls that i had eaten from.However,the soup taste is comparable to the malaysian's taste,as vouched by my mrs.I dare say,the soup taste could have been from the accumulation of the flavouring from the entire day's cooking stock.I may sound cruel in giving such critics,but i had tasted better bah kuts within SG while working as a cabby for a short while.This shop will get 3 stars for the time being..If there is consistency in the soup taste,be it lunch,noon to night on my next visits,i believe the rating will change again from my side..Keep up the good work guys"
"A well hidden gem found. The herbal fragrance can easily be smelled from the carpark. The ribs are nicely cooked and is not tough to bite on.

The soup base is smooth and not oily and is pleasant even for kids or elderly.

Try it. You may just fall in love with it."
"While there was a queue at dinner, it moved fast and the staff was friendly. Unfortunately, the you Tian and intestine was sold out which was a huge disappointment. The pork ribs itself was not bad; most pieces were soft and tender and went well with the dark sauce chilli. The soup was flavourful. The pork trotters was a tad salty but overall not too bad, and the fat went well with the rice. Personally I wish they have the fried tau kee that we can add to the soup."
It's not that great  for a wait abt 30mins..but it's hard to find black bak kue teh in singapore
One of the good place to taste the herbal soup style bak kut teh.
Chao Hao Wei
Standard dropped alot.
Reasonably priced. Good service despite long queue. Can ask for more soup. Strong herbal taste!
"Tasty. The pork leg is especially good. Bak kut teh is also very nice. Come before 12 on weekend to prevent long queue. Most importantly, the staff are very friendly despite its popularity!"
"The herbal bak ku teh  is good,price is reasonable,don't bother about their prawn mee though"
Nice but need to get there early
Hot pipping and delicious BKT. I LOVE IT.
Good food!
"Personally, the taste that got me wowed was no longer there.
The meat is tough, and with the change in soup base taste, it's really just any other bak kut teh.
If you are in the area and craving for some, this will suffice. But don't bother traveling across Singapore."
The food is not nice and there are lizards crawling all over the walls. It is no herbs at all
"The Bak Kut Teh soup is fragrant with a tinge of herbal taste. The pork ribs are meaty.

The ""cai wei"" (salted vegetable) is sweet to our surprise. Soft and easy to eat.

The pig trotters are lean and not fatty, suitable for people who are health conscious.

The ""taugee"" (beancurd skin) is a bit tough to my teeth.

Overall, one of the best BKT in Singapore and I fully recommend it."
Healthiest pig trotters I've ever eaten! Soup is tasty but lacking herbal taste. I like the braised salted vegetable. It is sweet and not salty at all. Tau gee can be softer. Will definitely come back again!
Long queue during lunch. Not enough tables.
"Reasonably priced and tasty soup. But the quantity of ribs, mushroom, etc can vary somewhat from time to time. Service is quick despite being packed to the brim during peak meal hours. You have a harder time getting a table than the wait for the food."
"Soup is tasty, good portion and @$3.00,it's a steal ."
"Tonic soup base good for those whom love. The pork was a bit disappointing. Small broken ribs and has not boiled to the point of ""meat drop "" effect."
"It's not bad only, think it's overrated, and too expensive at $6.50 for a bowl of Bah Kut Teh and rice. Add soup need to self-service.
Taste wise, can't beat those branded Bah Kut Teh that has their own chain.
Woodlands St 11 used to have another bah Kut Teh stall that is really good, but think close down already."
Am here again
"Better than expected, value for money"
Tasty and nice food
Really herbal tasting soup at reasonable prices! Delicious!
"Nice KL style claypot Bak Kut Teh, strong soup base."
So far one of the nicest/nearest place to eat  bah ku teh.
Delicious and reasonably price
"Taste-wise, good. Service, excellent. Ambience, not so good as it is located in a non-aircon coffee shop.  Price, fair. About S$5.50 for a bowl of bak kut soup with about 3 pieces of pork ribs (for one person). Rice is 50 cents per bowl.

If you're driving, it may be difficult to find parking lots at the open-air carpark as it also serves a large market and food centre next door. A better bet would be to park at the multi-storey carpark at the other side and walk a bit further."
Something better than the usual peppery bkt. This is something closer to malaysian herbal bkt
Great tasty bak kut teh at unbelievable prices. We are regular patrons of this place.
Nice herb taste
Nice prawn noodles
"Tang Di Hao He,Jie Qian Bu Shi Hen Gui. "
"I have to be very bias here on this review. The fact this BKT style is similar to Malaysia general BKT style makes me feel at home.
Not just the feel of eating back at Malaysia. But the same taste of the herbs infuse into the soup reminds me of the way my dad cook his BKT for us as well.
The pork selection is varied, I would recommend the ribs hands down. With additional penuts or you tiao and the beancurd skins.
Price is very reasonable. Do come early before the peak hours to avoid wasting time waiting on table."
The best BakKuTeh in the universe!
Quite good herbal style bak ku teh in Singapore. It mix pepper and herbal style together.
Price wise is affordable.. the only problem is that the place is quite pack during dinner time. The soup is light and not so peppery. One of the best soup I have tried. However there is a lack of meat in the soup. Overall I would recommend
Crowded and the seafood soup in the same coffee shop is great.
I brought many friends that to try their bkt. All of them said it was good
Very unique herbal cum peppery soup
"Bak Ku Teh with a difference, a medicinal flavour. Must try."
Nice and good. Herbal Malaysian style.
Best herbal Ba ku teh
"Prawn mee, ok value for money"
"Although herbal soup base, but it is not too strong taste. Ingredients are fresh. Service is friendly."
Bak kut teh taste lighter than last time
The soup was flavourful.. most recommended are the pig organ and Bak ku teh
"From many years back till now, the taste of this Hokkien Bak Kut Teh stays consistently ""Good"" as well as the braised pork knuckle. Recommended."
Soup today was a little off mark.
Nice bak ku teh. Inconsistent standards when its crowded. Try the seafood soup instead. Nicer in my opinion
It's rare to find the Malaysian style of BKT here in Singapore so this already is enough to put it a notch above the rest here. Conveniently located right beside the much famed seafood soup
"Average bak kut teh with added tau pok. As usual,  soup is tasty. The pork rib in black sauce soup is good."
"Authentic Malaysia style bak ku teh is herbal soup. The taste of the herbs are not overpowering. Love the intestine and pig stomach. Intestines are properly cleaned, no smell and it's tender. Pig stomach is a little over cooked though. I like it to be a little chewy so it suits me. Salted vegetables is just nice, not too salty or sweet."
Best in Singapore! Always great and very busy. Coffee shop style.
"One of the best herbal type of Bah Kut Teh around. And the closest thing to the real authentic ones across the causeway.

Soup base had strong herbal taste and not too salty. They have a variety of different takes, From Bah Kut Teh only to mixed claypot with a mixture of pork ribs and innards.

Price is reasonable with average price around 6 to 7 dollars per pax.

Coffeeshop is a tad small and will get crowded fast during lunch and dinner times."
"Very used to eating Teochew type, this is the first time I tried the Hokien version of Bak Ku Teh. The soft pork ribs were boiled to satisfaction. The liver, kidney and salted veg were good. Price wallet-friendly.

The eatery was very crowded as it is popular. Go early to avoid crowds. Recommended."
The go-to place for Malaysian style herbal bah kut teh
Great unique taste
"Decent bak kut teh, the meat is slightly chewy, but on the whole, quite filling."
Could had been better....
"The bak Ku teh taste mild compare to last time, meat still tender but the soup base not as good."
Very authentic favour. Price are reasonable. The Braised pork feet(Lu Zhu Jiao) is a must to try! Soft and favour boiled into the meat.
Sorry not for me. It is not halal.
"Awesome herbal bak ku teh, must eat in the north"
"The coffee shop is relatively old with 8 to 9 stalls. Outside seats are under direct sunlight. Most people order from the bak kut teh stall, which explains the popularity of the stall. $7 for bak kut teh, rice, and Cai Wei. I prefer this herbal soup to the peppery type. Value for money."
alot of nice food to eat
BLACK HERBAL SOUP BASE. Very POPULAR too. Limited tables.
Nice Bak Kut Teh and seafood soup
Best herbal version bak kut teh. do not miss the herbal soup when you are around the area
"bak ku teh is nice.. its not the just pepper soup bak kut teh.. you can add veggie, yiu tiao, gloden mashroom,  intestine etc to make it more tasty, of course with additional cost.."
Acceptable and waiting time not too long.
Still the place to go for great Bak Kut Teh!
"amount of ingredients, tenderness of meat "
loved the herbal soup but the quantity is lesser
Very famous for their ba ku teh. The taste is more herbal compared to the peppary ones. Service is very quick and each bowl cost about 6 dollars only
Nice herbal bak ku teh unlike normal bak ku teh which is hot & spicy.
So so.. nothing special...
above average bkt
Nice bak kut
Ok.. not too bad
"Can't rave enough about HJBKT. In my opinion, they have 1 of the best BKT in SG, which is on par with the BKT found in Kluang. The soup is thick and flavourful while the other side dishes like the intestines, dao ki & beans are worth trying. Soup is also re-fillable. Definitely the place to be for some authentic Bak Kut Teh!"
So so.. nothing specials...
"Superb bak ku teh, Malaysia style. Their pig trotter is good too, definitely must try"
They served Malaysia style black herbal sour instead the white pepper type. Taste good but a bit expensive.
Generous servings at low prices
Good food!
Excellent food. Traditional Malaysian BKT!
"Was very disappointed with the herbal soup bkt. Doesn't taste the same as before, couldn't taste the herbs at all .Ordered the dry bkt but was serve the soy sauce type. Totally salty to drink the soup."
Good food at affordable price
Prawn noodle very very good!
Lousy food. Dirty environment. Food taste cannot compare to KL herbal bak ku teh.
"Herbal style Bak Ku Teh, but I would like it with a stronger herbal taste. This is similar to Malaysian style Bak Ku Teh."
Very good.
"Specially like the fish soup and the prawn mee stall,  sometime the bak ku teh...  The indian prata not bad too."
"Without a doubt one of the best Bak Ku Teh stalls in Singapore! Absolutely love the herbal soup (not the peppery type though). Plus, you can request for more soup free of charge!"
Good taste
"Nice and value for money Bak Ku Teh located in the neighbourhood. From It's aromatic herbs soup base to the tenderness of the ribs and fatty trotter.
Ampler HDB parking space at the back of the block."
"Nice relaxing place in a lay back ""untouched"" HDB estate. Nice herbal style bah kut teh. Enjoy the lay back feel of the neighborhood ... Market have huge variety of food too ^^"
One of the very few unique bak kut teh around! Herbal type soup instead of the usual pepper type clear soup. Taste is consistent also. Crowded most of the time during meal times. Worth checking out!
Nice herbal bak ku teh and prawn noodle
Marsiling market
"Quite hit and miss actually. That's what you get when everything is made from scratch. On good days, the herbal broth can send you to the high heavens and back with but one sip from the hot claypot. On lesser days, the broth is still tasty although more to do with the secondary ingredients rather than the herbs."
"Soup very nice, meat not bad, serving is very fast"
One of the best BKT.
nice herbal soup base bak kut teh
"Amazing Bak Kut Teh for the price itself! The soup was very fragrant, the meat was also very tender! For the price paid of $7, the whole meal was very delicious and affordable! The dough fritters were also good! Highly recommend to try if anyone is around marsiling area!"
Qiang Li Tui Jian Hao Chi De Rou Gu Cha
So far the best bak kut teh after trying so many other places
Not so good
Not nice at all ...
"One of the best bak kut teh in Singapore. It's kind like Malaysian bak kut teh and herbally cooked with black broth, not the peppery one. To reach here ride MRT to Woodlands MRT then go to bus interchange, ride bus no. 913 Berth 6 (not 5) then walk about 5 mins here. It's really affordable."
"Went late evening, ordered mixed ingredient pot but came with lots of liver and pork ribs only. Where are mushrooms, intestines, stomach, beancurb skin supposed to be in the mixed pot?? Soup became overpowering taste of metalic liver. Not nice at all! Ordered separate pot of intestines came belly pork without any notice. When asked, the response was no intestine so we just give you pork loh. Kind of hard selling without notice. If ingredients are not available, should not have inform customers items are available. Only plus point is the availability of top for soup. Family didn't enjoy the dinner, unlikely to go again."
Nice soup bakuteh.try!
rich prawn soup with plenty of toppings
Good herbal BKT.
Hen Pu Tong. 
The kind of a very good but underhyped eating place. Bah kut teh is of the brown herbal soup type. Soup is refillable for free. What a satisfying treat.
Totally in love with their bak kut teh. Don't mind to travel far for this! You can add soup without additional charges.
A very long estiblistment selling herbs Bak kut tah
Waited quite a bit on a Sunday
One of the best Bak Kut Teh in the North of Singapore. Authentic old style preparation adds more charms to a simple dish of meat soup
Malaysia taste
"Average food, if they don't up the coffee shop hygiene I think this place confirm have food poisoning soon. I'm not targeting at the stall itself, but the coffee shop as a whole. Pigeon flying ard, stray cats in the coffee shop, dirty tables and chairs, rusty shelter"
Meet chewy but not tough. Soup tasty but you do not feel thirsty later.  Excellent price.  Coffee shop setting.
Baik la sia
"Wo Xi Huan Chi Ta De Xia Mian,Zhen De Bu Cuo Hao Wei Dao You Chi Dao Xia Mian De Gan Jue,Bak Ku teh Ye Shi Hao Chi"
Awesome Amazing Affordable
Loves their soup.  Very herb base.
Malaysian style BKT
The herble soup is so delicious
"The food quality is not consistent,sometimes too salty and sometimes the taste is not enough"
"The best malaysia style i have ever try.
Is still my best choice"
Lovely herb bkt must try
Great soup!!
Food was consistently maintained at very high standards even though it was jam packed during lunch hours. Had a satisfying lunch.
It is nice! had my lunch here. the portion is just nice. tried the herbal bkt and the pork trotter and rice
"The BKT soup has a strong herbal taste, the way I like it. Ribs is good but not tender enough for my preference. For those who like leaner and harder ribs, it's worth a try. Avoid otherwise."
Standard still there but service lag
Average food taste
"Excellent. I don't really fancy rib meat, but their meatball option is highly competent. The oiled vegetables are of a small serving and ordinary in taste."
"Pu Tong Yi Ban,Shi Pin Jie Ge Da Zhong Hua. "
"Tasty pork rib soup and I love the braised small intestine,  so chewy and tasty."
Zhu Jiao Hen Hao Chi
Tasty foods.
The bah ku teh tastes good. It is different from the peppery teochew style.
"One of the best herbal bkt around. Best on a rainy day. Choose the mix pot instead of all meat for a good, fresh variety of pork.

Order the sides. They are good stuff. Will definitely be back if in the area.

Hard to compare but I'll take this anytime over the famous peppery bkt in sg which are also overpriced."
good. Fantastic
Nice bak kut teh with refillable soup! :)
"Very impressed meat soup, as well as the steam pork ankle !"
Great food at an affordable price.
4 stars for the Bak Kut Teh.. but not for the pig trotter.. it's a little too firm and hard to tear the meat off the bone - not sure if it's by design - just not to my liking.
Delicious food
Good variety of items available.
Good delicious food.  Nice pork ribs with slice mushroom n tow pok
"Ribs could be more tender.... Not much herbal aroma from soup, could be better"
One of the best hokkien style bak Ku teh in Singapore. Their soup have strong herbal taste and smell. However their meat is a bit lacking mainly because I think they use frozen pork. If you do not mind that then it's a must try! Make sure to order yew jiak guay to compliment it!
One of the best.
You will like the Bat Kut teh if you prefer herb instead of peppers type of soup. Recommended 
Nice food but crowded.
Nice herbal style bakuteh
Good herbal style bak ku teh. Standard is very consistent so far all my visits.
Shiok!! Eat and Eat! Never enuff!
Very good food! Highly recommended!
"They are quite busy almost everyday and the food take quite a while to serve, but it's a very very delicious pot of Bak Kut Teh that's worth the wait!"
One of the best hokkien style bak kut teh in Singapore.
Average food
Few in woodlands do not know of this place that had served Malaysian styled claypot bak kut teh for decades. The price is kept low due to a lack of furnishings which is how I like it. Soup refills are welcomed. Ingredients are also generous.
Herbal style soup
Good food! But can be quite warm especially with the hot broth soups
One of the good herbal bak kut teh in the area
Its a great teast
The black herbal type. My favourite.
"It's the herbal of BKT, if you don't really herbal kind of BKT it might not suit you as the herbal taste is quite strong. But overall, it's quite a delicious bowl of traditional herbal BKT with taupok and mushroom. The pork rib is soft and well cooked. $5 for a bowl of BKT is quite reasonable compared to other places which usually cost $8 and above. Quite good!"
"Excellent herbal style Bak kut teh. Reasonably priced at $6 for a set. Tip: add golden mushrooms for $1, very generous portions!"
"No taste of herbs or pepper. Still affordable price
though.."
"Good, but not sure why, I felt very thirsty every time after eating it. "
Excellent value for money
Rou Gu Cha Zhi De Yi Shi
The food is not as good as 10 years back. But the taste is still OK
Took a while for the food to come. Soup was good.. but the rest of the dishes was just ok.
The food is good and nice.
Nice but a bit pricey
Best herbal bah kut teh in town
Nice food. Variety of foods beside the bak kut teh.
best place to have dinner over there
Ok it establish very long time ago with herbalvariaty and broth boil clay pot quiet unique and suppose to warm the body patron non stop from lunch to dinner ok try to know all are welcome coffe shop
"so so nia, famous but not really tasty. meat a bit hard
pork throttle a bit salty. no garlic to go with.."
Typical coffee shop setting. Can refill soup. Nicely
"Zhe Li Shi Wo Yi Ban Duo Nian Lao Xiong Di Xi Huan Ju Can He Liang Bei De Di Dian,You Xu Duo Mei Hao De Hui Yi. "
decent tehh
Delicious! One of the best in SG!
Always the go to place for my family and myself whenever we want a bowl of good bak kut teh! Never fails to curb our cravings when we go to them! Highly recommended!
Best bkt tasted
The best bak kue teh
Good hawker food at affordable price.
Food is OK. But the place is not very clean.
Excellrnt food
A good find in sg for those tat like malaysian style bak but teh.. the soup is good and can be refill(self service).  The kopishop is quite packed during lunch hour.. parking may need to wait too.  Will come again
"This BKT was delicious, however slightly on the pricy side. $17.00 for 2 person."
"Came here on a weekend noon. Once you reach here, you can smell the fragrant bak ku teh smell. The coffeeshop was quite crowded but we managed to find seats. There was no queue at the shop as you just need to order and wait at your seat. Waiting time for food wasn't long. The soup was filled with pork ribs and tau pok but the meat was hard and soup is ok. Overall not worth the special trip down here just for bak ku teh."
"We had a pot of mixed BKT for sharing, together with rice and salted vegetables for $14. The BKT soup was extremely nice! It is definitely not as strong as the ones sold in Malaysia but I felt that it was just nice on the palate. Don't get the salted vegetables though, it tasted pretty sweet and we didn't really like it. The youtiao and braised eggs were sold out when we went for dinner, but it will definitely be a good side dish on top of the soup!"
BKT is above average. Not great though.
Soup is diluted and meat is hard.  The stall helper isn't friendly.  Overrated
"I went there last Sunday night, and after placing the order, I saw a rat on the kitchen floor of this Bak Ku Teh stall. This will be my first and last time eating there!"
"food tastes excellent, reasonable prices!"
Best bah kuh teh
"Fragrant herbal bak kut teh served in claypot! After eating this, I prefer the malaysian version better - so much richer in flavour."
Great value for money
"Pork knuckle, cheap and good"
Great bak kut teh at reasonable price! Might have to wait for seats tho.
Still so nice after decades
Best herb style BKT. More tasty than Malaysia BKT
Soup served in generous portions. Strong herbal taste and strong on the stomach. Refills allowed.
Herbal broth is good. Prices are reasonable.
Parking inconvenient
ENOUGH MEAT TO FIN THE RICE 
All good food.
Very nice herbal back GUI tea
One of the best tasting and value for money prawn noodles!
The soup has no herb flavor. Mayn my expectations too high
"Taste average, more towards herbal taste rather than pepper taste."
a taste of KL Klang style
"Herbal Bak Kut Teh, price is affordable, tastes good.

Fried Dough Fritter (you tiao) is definitely not tops. More likely buy from supplier then just cut up. The star is definitely the soup. The meat depends on your luck, sometimes get the tough parts, some are tender. Believe they don't just use one particular cut of meat that's why.

Tip, if you go in large groups, don't think about ordering the large portion. Order individual portion comes up to about the same price and you'll get more meat.

Service is really fast, it's usually pretty packed especially during dinner time, but the wait is really short. Take your order, sit for a bit they will deliver to you. Which is really great."
"This hawker sells bak kut teh (also known as pork bone soup), a Singaporean favourite. What makes this particular place stand out is their spin on this commonly - found dish.

This style of bak kut teh is one that is boiled with lots of herbs, resulting in a dark coloured broth that is highly flavourful. (side track: the more-commonly-found variant of bak kut teh has white broth, with a distinct peppery taste)

The food is flavourful and the service is relatively prompt, which in turn makes this eatery a suitable quick-lunch stop. The stall also offers free soup refills, and it is not uncommon to find a person walking around offering to top up your soup. (if that person is not to be found, simply asking the hawkers manning the stall suffices). The selection is somewhat limited to bak kut teh, but they do have some variety in the type of bak kut teh (E.g. Lean meat, etc. etc.). There are also the typical sides that one expects to accompany such a meal.

Word to the wise: tables are limited and gets filled up quickly during lunch time. Highly recommended to reach the area before 12."
Very tasty yum..
Yummy bakkutteh best of all i hv tried ate it since 2005 till now
Authentic bakuteh with combo fish and prawn soup !!!
Huan Chi De Guo Ba!
Price reasonable and big portion.
Nice food. But crowded during lunch time. Need to wait for table. Worth it though.
"It's a malaysian style kind of BKT.
Not too bad a taste. I will only give it 3.5 star. Many will say it's good but I will say to each their own.
Whatever you do please do not eat during the end of the day. They dilute the soup in which it tastes yucky. I happened to be there about 8pm. Having a late dinner. So I thought I would try it but to my disappointment the soup was diluted! That is an utter NO NO for me and utterly disappointed with the taste. I do not believe in compromising taste for more servings. That is really bad to begin with.
So be warned. Only have it during the day!
Apart from that they serve Prawn mee too.
Enjoy the food."
The bakuteh itself is 5star. Must try.
Cheap and good
Good and tasty. Soup can be refikled. Can be crowded during peak hours
One of the better herbal ones
The best Bak Ku Teh I have eaten so far. Not to be missed if you like the Herbs type. 
Really good herbal broth that keeps you going for more. Perfect during cold seasons! Additional sides of preserved vegetables give a boost to the flavour as the acidity cuts through the fatty ribs. Really good!
The soup is quite robust - the Malaysian style herbal soup. The pork rib is not up to expectation though.
Waited quite long. Food is ok.
"One of the Malaysia style traditional Bakuteh in Singapore that is still reasonably priced. Taste good as well. Usually crowded during lunch, dinners and weekends."
"Rich taste of Chinese herbs. However, the meat bone soup leans on the salty side. Take note."
Crowded place but fast service. No special ingredients but it's ok
"Slightly expensive (relatively), but still satisfying"
The BKT is AH-MAY-ZING AMAZINGLY GOOD!! The coffee shop is filled with people having their meals from the BKT shall so be prepared to fight for seats during peak hours LOL.
Great and yummy BKT. But they are super busy. Managed to get our order wrong despite confirming and repeating our order.
Best BKT in Singapore
Visited on 4 Dec 2017. Had bak kut teh and 2 other dishes. Found all of them too saltish. Doubt I will patronise again.
"The food standard fluctuate, maybe the place is crowded, hard to keep up the standard.   Few times visit found out the soup is diluted ."
Tasty food and you always can ask for refill of soup
"Taste no bad, can try for it"
"If you like herbs bak ku teh, then try this one...delicious"
If you are looking for authentic Malaysia Bak Kut Teh in Singapore...this is one which you must try. 
yummy bakuteh. but too crowded.
"If you love Klang's BKT, do not forget to add dark soy sauce into the soup (do add it yourself). Honestly, tasted bland without dark soy sauce. Herbal taste is decent, had better ones in Malaysia. I rate 4 stars because it is relatively cheaper than other herbal BKT stalls in Singapore. Portion is also generous."
"Came here for the herbal bak kut teh.

Bak Kut Teh - Ordered mixed for 5 pax. Totally bland. No taste at all. Don't taste the herbal too.

Braised pork belly - A lot nicer, that's why I gave overall 2 stars."
Nice herbal Bak kut teh.
"I was told this is the best Bak Kut Teh restaurant at the North of Singapore.
It is the herbal type and not pepper."
You can order mee sua or noodles to go with the bak kut teh instead of rice.
"great food - ordered the mix bak kut teh that also comes with pork liver, stomach and tau pok"
"Good herbal bak kut teh, braised peanuts at affordable price"
Famous for Malaysian style herbal bak kut teh. The prawn noodles are also pretty good.
Immediate and very friendly professional service. Delicious food. Lively atmosphere.
Got newspaper cutting to introduce this place. Viewing at stall.....
Soup top up is free and the the taste is pretty good. Cleanliness of the place might be a concern to some.
"The soup base is like those in Malaysia. Small dishes is also good. I like the peanuts, is so soft and tasty."
One of the best bak kut teh you can find in Singapore that is not the peppery type.  Finding a table and seat is quite challenging during peak meal hours though.
Hood tasy BKT
Best Herbal style BKT in Singapore
Food so so only
Herbal style Bak Kut Teh. Limited seating especially during lunch hours.
Cheap n good. Bkt and fish soup beside. Try both!
"Very popular place, difficult to get a table during the weekends. It's a style that's not as herbal as Klang BKT but is still good. Soup is also less salty compared with some BKT chains. Take note that the Prawn Noodles are usually sold out by 3pm."
Good. Not the usual peppery type of soup but the herbal type.
bakuteigaZhi i
Nice good food
Great taste of herbs bah Kut Teh. It's not easy to find herbs type BKT in SG. Price is cheap as well.
The only Bak Kuk Teh which has the standarf for its name in this region
Lots of people. Always not seat
losing it initial taste
The soup is very nice. However it is a bit bland compare to my last visit there.
Bak ku teh is popular in north and prawn mee is good reasonable and good portion.
Claypot bak ku teh with herbal soup base.
The taste of Herb based and it's pretty good. Worth the trip
"It was good, the food was very nice. But the place was hot and a little humid, and there were people smoking at eating areas."
Good herbal soup
Best Bak Kut Teh in North zone
Haven't try
Awesome place for bak kut teh.. Come early on the weekend otherwise most are sold out
Good and cheap food
Authentic herbs Bah Kut Teh in craypot. Thumbs up for the soup!
"The soup was very flavourful!! Even thkugh the place was very crowded, we didnt have to wait long. Cheap, good and authentic food!"
Soy sauce bak kut teh with a herbal undertone. Good  n hit the spot if you are missing Malaysia bak kut teh. Just wished they had a more pronounced meaty n deep taste in the soup.
Very good value for money
I like the herbal soup but the small intestine is a little bitter
Authentic and delicious
Famous baktuteh. Herbal type.
Very crowded during lunch. Nice Bah Kut Teh.
Nice ba ku teh. Must try
Tai Duo Ren Zai Na Bian Chang De Jiu
herbal bak kut teh is really good. must try!
Nice herbal bak kut teh
"One of the better bak kut teh around. Quality has dropped somewhat compared to 5 years ago, as well as smaller portions. Overall still good quality soup. The free soup refills is a plus."
Nice herbal bak ku teh
Love the herbal taste of the soup. Not too peppery. It's definitely a 5 stars dish. Don't expect good service during peak hours though. And refill of soup is free!!!
"Good place for herbal bak kuk Teh.

Indian food also good
Fish soup is good
Prawn mee is good

Seating, not so good, tends to be crowded and warm. However food is worth the wait!"
The best herbal bak ku teh in the North!
Nice flavor but pricey. The clay pot adds a nice touch.
Nice and unique flavor! Very different compared to others.
Nice food and fast service
As close to the 'real' Malaysian style BKT as u can find here
Superb BKT
Business is brisk so come early as the soup base sometimes sells out before 7-8pm!
One of the best herbal bak kut teh in Singapore! Too bad I didn't get to try the other dishes. Will definitely be back.
Very good ribs at a very affordable price
"Lovely BKT soup! The meat is so tender - I usually don't fancy the meat but this was good that I finished all of them

The soup was great - you can ask for more soup and the stall assistant/owner will gladly give it to you."
The Bak Kut Teh here is excellent
"There's always a queue here for their claypot bak kut teh(herbal pork rib soup)

personally find that it's ok only but the fact that it's cooked in a claypot plus fresh ingredients, are a plus

the soup it self is mildly herbally,some might find it close to being bland"
Has the Malaysia Bakutteh taste! And reasonably priced.
I recommended this stall if you like Bak Kut Teh herbal type.
Herbal Pork Ribs Soup (Bak Kut Teh Rou Gu Cha). This is different taste from the usual peppery version.
"Friendly staff, best rainbow kueh. The fish keropok is one of the best I've had.

Very good rice dumplings that does not employ the use of dried shrimp, scallops. Great for for people that are allergic to it"
Tried the nyona one. Filling was fantastic but would've preferred if served hot. Would recommend takeaway and microwave/steam a little bit
"One of the place that I will go to for bak chang, freshly made daily and love both the nonya and the hokkien version. If want to buy during the dumplings festival, be prepared to order in advance or go in early morning to get it before it sold out."
One of the better nyonya dumplings.
"Really nice traditional kuehs, dumplings, bak chang everything. They're very popular and often sell out early so they're rarely open after 11 AM. On some festive occasions, like dumping festival, they make special dumplings - which sell out very fast, so better go down and preorder!

The price is higher than average, but they claim handmade stuff and premium ingredients, which you can feel very well.
Overall highly recommended!"
Not bad honestly. A lil overpriced but will be back if in the vicinity.
It is the best Dumplings I ever had. Better to Kim choo in my opinion.
"Best Nyonya dumplings I have ever tasted!
Blk 50A Marine Terrace!
MUST TRY !!! Gu Zao Wei Zong Zi!!!"
"If u are a big fan of Rice dumpling, their Nonya rice dumplings were the best in Singapore. Myself, hubby, my kids and my in-laws love it!"
Only 7 pcs of oyster in medium plate. Taste wasn't good either. Dissapointed as some reviews were good.
"$5 plate, overall a good plate of fried carrot cake as you expected.  Why 4 stars is due to the sad reason now a days it's harder to find a good plate with taste and texture right.  There is 3 stores (at least) selling carrot cake, might update again after I try all.
However, I feel the ""Cai Pu""a bit weak.  Go try Lorong 8 Toa Payoh for a plate with fantastic ""Cai Pu"""
"Not going back! $4 and so small packet. Auntie super black face. Speak behind her mask ""want chili , no chili?"" Cannot hear her but she buay song. So ok, sorry my fault I cannot hear u but u also must fry properly lah. This is too expensive and most importantly NOT NICE"
White carrot cake is bland and mushy. I have not tried the other food options.
Delicious Fried Carrot Cake with generous portions. Both Black and White versions taste great. Good value for money.
Auntie is doing the food as good as uncle. Do give continuous support.
"The black fried carrot cake looks unassuming but it is delicious. It would have been perfect if it was less sweet and preserved vegetable added to this dish and has wok hei but it is good enough as it is especially for $3.50.
Service is a little slow because it is operated by three elderly ladies but they were flexible when I changed my order from eating there to packing back."
"To me, this is one of nicer carrot cake .
Nothing is lack busting.
Best to makan during  morning. Less people."
Taste so bland. Very oily also.
"Stall serving Fried Carrot Cake, Fried Oyster eggs & Fried Kway Teow. Should be the best in this Hawker Ctr as the waiting time is usually around 15min, even though there are two cooks an assistant."
"Came for an afternoon break. Ordered their white carrot cake for $3.50 with chilli. The version of their carrot cake is with soft eggs and chilli added into the carrot cake not on the side. Light egg fragrance and soft eggs from their white version. Though the spiciness level is not specified, I do feel some punch. I should add more on my next visit. Overall a good plate of white carrot cake. Will be back for other dishes."
"I tried the white carrot cake with chilli. Sorry to say I felt disappointed. Taste is bland, I mean no fragrance, and chilli is almost non existence. Just abit of chilli oil. There is no soul in it."
Amazing carrot cake with wok hey and many eggs. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Must try
Too wet and sticky
"Bought their white carrot cake for $3.80.

Their sign board wrote top 10 biggest carrot cake in Singapore. The carrot cake is the big chunk variety but then it is really not the largest but I guess with most of the carrot cake being small chunk it is not difficult to be in the top 10.

The only good thing I feel is a chili. Crispiness was way below par. While the texture has an unpleasant greasiness to the soggy carrot cake. Taste wise was still okay on the saltier side with occasion pieces with nice char taste."
"No option to give 3.5 stars. Had the white carrot cake. Sides were a little crispy (Xiao Shuang)and it has wok hey taste. Portion can be bigger. Overall not bad. Read reviews the black carrot cake is good, can try that next time!"
"A well executed plate of carrot cake. Kway was soft.

Touch of caramelization though lacking in preserved radish which would have added another dimension."
"Better than the Soon Soon Carrot Cake Stall located at the same Hawker Centre. Was pretty good for $4. However, they are closed on certain days. And depending on the time of day. The wait could be somewhere around 4 minutes to 20 minutes based off experience. Might be longer during lunch rush. I usually arrive between 9am for breakfast or 12pm for lunch if I decide to have it."
"Not the best hokkien noodle and fry kueh tiaw I ever had in Marsiling area

Hokkien noodle - the ingredients many, but the taste not there. Can't really taste the prawn broth.. I like the noodles size and thick beehon type of hokkien noodle....portion huge

Kueh tiaw - I thibk its equivalent to the economy kueh tiaw stall standards. The only diff are ingredients. Come with chinese sausage..  but not that fragrance type sausage... portion huge"
While the carrot cake is of decent quality. Significantly long wait is required and it is hard to estimate unless you get confirmation from the owners. Even had an incident where i waited for 40min only to discover my order has been forgotten will not be revising.
We always visit this stall and their neighbours Yan Ji at Marsiling Mall Hawker Centre for a nice dinner at Woodlands.
"We had the fried carrot cake for black and white spicy version. Overall, the black version was better and spicier than the white one. It would be great to mix black and white. The white was nicer fried but lacking the crispiness of the eggs. The service was pretty fast and they have a beeper which was very convenient.good..."
Portion is OK for sgd 4. No wok hey. Quite fast.
"Lousy Fried Kway Teow at $4 paying just for the noodles. Few Ingredients, Its like eating those pre cooked dry mee with fish cake,  Ngoh hiam for breakfast sold at many central stalls in the morning!"
Love the taste
"This stall is originally from Old Woodlands Centre.   Carrot cake especially the black version tastes great here, definitely better than average.

14032020"
"Ridiculously Priced, Definitely do not visit. This bowl cost me $9! Can you imagine? I ordered a Spicy three that cost $5 so i ask the guy can i change the Chinese sausage to roast duck he tell me can no problem need to top up some money and I'm fine with it and i add noodles end up he charges me $9 for this... I add $1 i can get two bowl of noodles!"
"Super little meat given for a packet of soya chicken rice. They will pack more rice but 2, 3 pcs of meat. 3rd time buying still same.... Won't buy again."
"This Hong Kong Style Roasted Delight Stall is located in the coffee shop at Blk 167 Woodlands Street 11. I visited this establishment for lunch as I reside in the vicinity. I was accompanied by my friend, who was assisting me with a house painting project.

We ordered three treasure delights, which are good enough for 2-3 persons for a meal. It consists of roasted duck drumstick, roasted pork, and char siew. Overall, the meal is great. I recommend trying the char siew as it is really tender and flavourful, but take note it is the fatty portion."
One of the popular ourlet in Singapore. Food are reasonably cheap and good.
"Food taste good but the fat guy attitude so rude ,  seem like he don't like customer order food from him , won't go again even the food is nice"
"Visited on the 23 Nov, 1:20am +/-.

First attempt on the outlet stores.

The store was empty, me thinking that the person might be in the gents, so we waited awhile.

Was greeted by a dragging feet behind us after awhile in which he went to the store front to start cleaning the chilli dispenser area (good hygiene practice) carried out at a relatively awkward timing.

Ordered San Bao Mian,while waiting we saw a note at shop front stating that hua zai roast duck is concerned on the service standard and stuff and also listed down the store manager Mr Yong number - was delighted that the management took up such initiative to maintain the standard, until I finish the purchase.

The store rep pass us the noodles and collected $10 from us and was return $4.80 worth of coins. Checked back with him if he have notes, negative.

Maybe we could have more notes (if what he said is true)or at least pass me one note and some coins.

Maybe we could leave the cleaning after the customer purchase? Was dumbfounded as it's literally us there and is there a need to do that at the moment?

Maybe his service could be better. I mean if he could just provide service at the first place.

Now I fully understand why the service note were placed at the store."
"good price m good service.
self help with soup n i like this idea."
"Ordered a spicy three treasure noodle, roast pork and sausage was pretty decent but the real champion is the charsiew, if you like fatty cuts, this is worth trying"
Not too salty nor too oily.
"Last time the stall just open, the food was good.

But now the service and food are BAD cause THEY REDUCE THE HOR FAN FOR SHREDDED CHICKEN HOR FAN and DO NOT APOLOGISE FOR THE MISTAKE like give chicken slices with bone instead of shredded chicken.

THE STAFF THERE LIKE NOT TRAINED PROPERLY IN SLICING THE MEAT AND STILL GIVE PIECE OF BONES WITH THE CHICKEN SLICES."
The portion given by different server varies. The lesser serving can up 50% less.
$3.50 per set. The price is affordable and the food portion is big and delicious 
Best chicken wing ever
"The auntie very friendly
Once i wanted fried kway tiao she told me to wait five mins cause got hot one
Wait for just fried one"
"Amazingly Delish and VFM morning economic bee hoon breakfast, especially the fried chicken wing.

Very fragrant nasi lemak, spicy sweet sambal, tasty and crispy deep fried chicken wings, fried koay teow, etc. Really like the deep fried crispy pork chop! So good that I forgot to allow my camera to feast on some of the great picks.

Btw, after so many years, I still think this is the bestest economic bee hoon fried chicken wing in Singapore! Simply delish and value for money! Crispy, fragrant, juicy, tender and full of umami... Really love the secret marinade used.

Service is fast and the boss and lady boss there are super friendly and welcoming.

Come early, otherwise there's always a queue on the weekends."
"Bee hoon very nice, despite lightly seasoned. The side dishes are all prepared on the spot before the uncles began selling. Highly recommend!"
If u r in sg must one time need to eat here. Awesome noodles 
One of the best nasi lemak in woodlands so far. Regular customer here for the past 15 years.
Love their economic noodles
Amazing fried chicken wings. Worth every penny spent there.
"bad la one of the auntie (I posted a photo of her , not the uncle beside) , n just now I went there around midnight 3am-4am the auntie very rude to my mom , cos my mom tot the auntie count wrong amount cos my mom didn't know I added something after that has already paid and my mom kindly want to pay her again for the thing I added , the auntie said my mom ""where got count wrong"" , the auntie tot my mom say she count more but then my mom tot the auntie count less , then she scold my mom still stare at me for no reason ,, the service very bad leh , pls improve la , ik the food nice but the people not nice , ppl not nice then customer but one time also run and wont come back la , funny sia , disrespectful to customer"
Have seen long ques here. They don't open on Wednesday. Finally got to try it when they are not off. Bee Hoon is ordinary. Nothing to Wow about. Fried chicken not bad but when hot may taste better. $3.20 is still quite alright for 1 chicken wing and 1 luncheon meat. Overall I have eaten better ones.
Love the generous portions in this day and age of steep inflation.  Chicken wings at $1.30 is a steal!  There's a reason why this stall consistently gets long queues at anytime except at 4am when they first open ;)
Best fried chicken wings in Singapore. Same taste for over 20 years. 1 is never enough
"Had my breakfast here.  Well.. the kueh tiaw and noodles weren't that fragrance.  Just soya fry with it..

If got garlic will be nicer...

The portion okay..  sambal soso only.."
Very tasty noodles with economic pricing!
"The chicken wing is so flavorful. Should be the shrimp paste fried chicken wings? The bee hoon also another highlight. Normally been hoon steal is just ok, however this stall bee hoon is surprising me. Deserve to try ."
Really Nice. Price is nice too.
Fried noodles are to die for. Freshly cooked and doesn't have the usual alkaline taste like other economy beehoon stores' noodle. Store owner is very generous and friendly. 10/10  (the chicken wings are also a must try!!)
Ordered mee with chicken wing and otah. Chicken wing was just out super nice. Highly recommended for breakfast.
"Valuable meals for my brunch
The chicken wing , crunchy and crispy , juicy too.. will visit again ya "
"A great walk with a flavourful meal is such a reward on Saturday!
Love the beehoon! And my mama loves her kway teow and mee "
"Rude seller, tried to clear their other items and told me that chicken wing is unavailable while they were almost done frying at the back."
"Always my go-to breakfast spot! The fried bee hoon is fragrant and not too oily, and the portion is generous for the price. Their fried items are freshly made -- crispy and delicious, especially the luncheon meat and fish fillet. The staff are friendly and efficient even during busy hours. Convenient location and great value for money. Highly recommended if you're looking for a satisfying local meal!"
"I like the mains,this time I tried their char kuey teow, taste so good! And the boss and lady boss are so nice and welcoming."
"My first time here. I am impressed with the fried kway  teow. Soft tasty with a tinge of wok flavour. I coupled it with prawn fritter, fish cake , tow kwa and cabbage. Prawn fritter and cabbage are made from scratch by the chef. Really high standard! Strongly recommend you to eat here."
"Great beehoon that is pretty affordable too! Other than this day, I usually get a tau kwa and an egg which only costs my $2.20"
"Ordered the chicken cutlet mala fried rice. The stall holder confirmed with me at least three times what my order was but I still ended up with tom yum fried rice. Went back to the stall but was told to accept it in an indifferent tone. The rice was oily and the chicken cutlet was pathetically small also. For $7, you are better off trying fried rice at Oji at the food court at Parkway Parade."
Did a taste test. Their competitor is the paper wrapped and Hup Lee is in styrofoam box. Competitor long queue but Hup Lee no queue when I was there. Verdict of Taste: Hup Lee bee hoon and chilli definitely better. Herd instinct could be at play.
"Great service from the operators here. Service is quick enough and the options are generally wide enough for a weekly breakfast.

The beehoon and noodles in general are alright. Pretty strong dark soya sauce flavouring. The chilli helps to bring the dish together.

Overall, nothing really amazing. But it is humble and local breakfast."
"The San Lou hor fun here has a lovely wok hei. Ingredients like the beef and fish slices are always fresh and the portions are generous. Love too that the vegetables with the hor fun are bean sprouts and kai lan, cooked to perfection by a skilled chef.

A great gem of a stall in this neighbourhood."
Tasty but the hor fun needed just a touch more wok hey. Could just be today. Ingredients are extremely fresh and well cooked. Worth the price.
"Very humble store in a hawker centre helmed by a very friendly order taker and a great chef who dishes up simple hor fan (with great wok hei). The price is very reasonable and the dishes are great.

Don't expect restaurant ambience but for hawker centre San Lou Hor Fan, uts outstanding. You can ask for their crispypork lard bits too.

Highly recommended and will visit again."
"$6 per dish and takeout is 30 cents per box. Very tender beef slices and thick fish slices without skin. Hor fun has wok hei and very good elastic texture, not mushy or undercooked."
"Very good hor fun with good wok hei.

Ordered Beef hot fun with requested added ingredients (additional 2.50 for extra ingredients)... and eaten with the pork lard condiments.

Satisfying meal, food quality is better than most hor fun in some restaurants."
"Not able to decide which hor fun to try, I greedily ordered the option ""with everything"" - fish slices, beef slices, prawns. And added an extra egg.

I knew I was in for a treat when I saw the giant licks of wok hey flames  dwarfing even the cook himself and filling the entire kitchen.

I also watched him cook each protein separately - fish slices, beef slices, prawns, and finally an egg droppped into sauce, and crunchy bean sprouts to finish.

Of course it took longer to cook, but damb was it worth the wait. A smoky char is evident from your very first spoonful - permeating the sauce and the hor fun noodles. All 3 proteins were pitch perfect, with that juicy just-barely-cooked texture.

With extra egg, just $6.70. Simple food made exceedingly well, a total joy"
"It's one of the wok hey hor fun place. I usually takes the mixed ingredients hor fun, and I often top up Jia Liao ingredients to S$10/- per plate which his good size for 2 to share. Not small prawns but mid size ones. Fish slices many and vegetables. REMEMBER to take the crispy pork lard to add on the dish, i think he has seasoned it so it taste wonderful even on its own. Not on the menu choice for the up size but you just need to tell the Fei Lou (fat man) chef. Yah, I call him Fei Lou! 

Then our favourite too - their Har Jeong Gai (prawn paste chicken)... crispy outside and yet tender inside. Better than many restaurants in my view.

Try it - tell him another fei lou introduced."
"Quick and friendly service, no frills and filled with wok hey hor fun. Good to order when you feel lost when every other stalls have long queues"
"Ordered for takeaway (reheated before eating):

1) beef hor fan that day had good wok hei, easily the best dish of the 3 items I tried! Would also consider it to be a steal at $6 (+$0.30 for takeaway)

2) san lou hor fan - although also a hor fan dish.. no wok hei like the beef version. Generous fish slices though

3) Prawn paste chicken - tempted many travellers with the smell as I took the bus back. Reheated with grill, good but not wow for me.

Overall decent quality at the hawker price!"
"Bought a takeaway meal from stall. Despite ordering the meal regularly for many months the stall assistant forgot to include green chillies with the meal even though she was reminded. She is either very forgetful or engaged in lying to customers. Please do not trust the assistant and check the contents of your order that everything is there before leaving!

Lady boss is very friendly and genuine. Horfun is exceptional with wok hey flavour. They also do mini takeaway menu but will definitely travel for it!
"Tried the San Lou horfun n Ginger Beef rice. They are good.
But the star is the Prawn Paste Chicken. Wow! One of the best I tasted. Must try!
The crispy skin plus the well marinated chicken meat is yummy!"
Best beef hor fun with wok hei! Love all the dishes here. Our fave place to tapao for our gatherings!
Great wok hei. Great amount of fresh fish
"Ordered Beef Fried Rice, San Lao Hor Fun and Prawn Paste Chicken. I must say all the 3 items were delicious and value for money. Beef from the fried rice was very tender and loved""wok hei"" taste from the Hor Fun. Prawn Pasted Chicken was crispy and loved the extra crunchy crust that came along with it. Keep up the good work!"
Very tasty hor fun with wok hei which is rare these days.. and many good dishes including the crispy prawn paste chicken.wings
Had a regular hor fun and the wok hei was on point and ingredients are very fresh. Prawns are very crunchy and sweet. Been awhile since i have had such a good meal. Lady boss was very patient and recommended what was best. Family enjoyed the prawn paste chicken and my brother was singing praises for their pork ribs king rice. A hidden gem in the heart of marine terrace. Dont miss out!
Love the fish san lou hor fun very much as it smells fragrant with wok hei char hor fun. My go to comfort food. Big pieces of fish fillet. Generous serving. Very reasonable pricing too.
The beef hor fun and seafood fried rice are very delicious and the wok hei is definitely there. Value for money and CDC voucher is accepted too. The lady boss is damn friendly and serving time is quick. Also we ordered pork chop and shrimp paste mid wings.
wok hei with silky horfun is such a pleaser! Do try their generous serving of crispy golden pork lard nuggets. Their pork ribs and prawn paste wings that are well marinated and perfumey!
Good quality food. Wok taste. The fish slice hor fan is delicious. Portion is just right for one person. Highly recommend.
Full of wokhey !
"03 Oct 2023: Great wok hei flavor and sure is a comforting plate of fish hor fun with crunchy bean sprouts. Taste is great, reasonable price and serving portion is just nice."
They have one of the best seasoned prawn paste chicken that leaves one craving for more. Always have the prawn paste chicken as a side to their delectable hor fun or rice.
"Takeaway Order for 5 meal sets and chicken wings.
Add-on ordered 4 extra eggs BUT only 3 sets with extra egg after opened the boxes at home... OWE ME ONE EGG!

***  We mentioned the incident to the stall's lady during our next visit and she added a free egg for our order "
Hard to find good hor fun. This is definitely the better ones. Beef is tender. Horfun has strong wokhey.
"Best Horfun in Marine Parade area! The meat is tender, the gravy is thick and tasty, and a strong wok hei smell masks the entire plate. Delicious!"
The beef Hor fun is very nice cos it has wok hei taste and the beef is soft. Very nostalgic taste. The Pork Rib rice is also nice too. Meat is soft and the sauce is nice.
"And they are back ! So happy to see the previous chef back at the helm of the defunct Premium Horfun stall.

Good as ever!"
Very nice rosti that is evenly cooked and not as oily as other rosti! I had the crispy chicken cutlet. Would love to go back if I'm ever in the Woodlands area again
First visit. Saw many good reviews online and decided to try. Portion was generous for rosti.
Food is great but service is questionable.. we had kids but shop doesn't provide bowls.. in the end ask us to pay 30c for takeaway. Ek no thanks
"The food is okay but they made my order wrong instead of black pepper chicken I got mushroom chicken. Very disappointing.
The 3 packets of sauce rule is ridiculous"
"Ivan's Carbina serves up solid, satisfying comfort food with great quality ingredients. The flavours are well-executed, and the portions are generous, making it a really good value for what you're getting. The menu offers a nice variety, and you can tell the food is prepared with care.

The overall dining experience is pleasant, though there's still some room for improvement in terms of service speed during busier periods. That said, the food more than makes up for it. Definitely worth a visit if you're craving hearty, well-cooked meals. Would gladly come back to try more!"
"Chanced upon this hidden gem rosti, not too greasy and value for money!"
Snail pork sausage was recommended.
"Good food, good service, and generous portions with reasonable prices. Will definitely visit again. Very friendly staff too.

Visited for lunch and ordered their signature rosti with garlic sausage and snail pork sausage. Rosti was cooked very well. Portions were great, and the food was good.

The store is located at a local coffeeshop, so might get a little warm during the day.

Only downside is that the food is served with plastic utensils. Was hard to cut the sausage casing with the plastic knife and fork.

Would like to try their other dishes like chicken cutlet and steak, but am apprehensive because of their plastic utensils."
"Pretty huge portions, nice rosti but would be better if it can be crispier on the outside while still being soft on the inside. Mushroom sauce is nice. Would appreciate more sour cream too, given the huge rosti size."
Ok not bad
"Decent rosti at affordable price. Not very oily and crispy on the outside, and goes very well with the sour cream as the classic combination. Had the black pepper chicken chop to go with it. Definitely looking forward to trying other mains to go with the rosti next time."
I'm surprised by the quality of food. Everything was amazing. This place is such a hidden gem
"Rosti quality was good and was reasonably priced. Chicken chop was also flavourful and well done. Steak doneness was accurate according to our order.

All in all worth a try."
"My favourite Rosti!! Love the Snail sausage Rosti, other options available too like chicken chop.

Goes well with the cream!! Remeber to add an egg if didn't "
"We came specifically for the rosti, and it didn't disappoint. It had just the right balance of charred and tender parts. The accompanying teriyaki chicken chop and crispy dory fish were equally enjoyable. This place is definitely worth a return visit."
"food was very good and sumptuous, service was decently quick and atmosphere was relaxing"
I order pork chop and rosti. Pork chop was a tad over cooked and rosti could be crispier. Perhaps this is because I Dabao back home
Super affordable rosti in a neighbourhood area. The wait could be long during lunch/dinner time. Would still highly recommend!
Worth the travel down 
"Affordable rosti with generous amt of portion!! Each of our rosti costed $9.90 (we got cheese and garlic sausage). i liked the cheese sausage! rosti was also bombz in my opinion, and the egg yolk was runny :D although i think that the sour cream could have been better. BUT BUT highly recommend to come try if u're craving for rosti and living near the west! staff was very friendly too :) almost everyone around us was having the rosti haha"
Food was delicious
Always come here for their Dory Fish rosti and it never disappoints. Huge portion with great price. Best thing is aunty never forget you and know what sauce you like and don't like. Highly recommend to fellow local to try and support them.
"Ordered snail sausage and chicken parmigiana rosti, pretty yummy located under a coffee shop."
"Nice food, delicious and huge portion!"
"Compared to the price point of Marche and other western joints, Ivan's Carbina prices their rostis at a really affordable price. Meals start at $9.90. Portions are generous too.

The sour cream tasted odd in my opinion."
The fish and Rosti is very delicious. One nice thick slice of fish.  Rosti is always nice.  Highly recommended
"Food standard drop.
Was a regular customer to this store but not anymore.
Both chicken chop and rosti was cold.
Only given 2x chilli sauce and unable to ask for more.
Bad customer service experience."
Rosti is great and the steak is cook to requested doneness
Very decent rosti; just a TAD too charred. The sour cream was underwhelming; i wished it was more sour. Chicken chop's skin was correctly crispy  Pork chop was okay; wished it was more moist.
"Huge portions, totally worth it! Definitely recommend eating it there at the coffee shop so that the rosti or crispy chicken cutlet doesn't get soggy (tried grab before and it tastes best when just prepared). I do feel that the rosti is quite thick leaving the insides soft/more wet, so it could probably be fried longer so that more parts of it is crispier/drier."
"This is the first western stall that I have been to in a coffeeshop that offered Rosti together with western cuisine.

For lunch, I ordered Rosti with black pepper chicken chop. The rosti was delicious, with a pleasingly crispy exterior and a soft interior. The black pepper sauce and also the cream paired well with the chicken chop and Rosti. The only comment is that I feel the chicken chop is quite dry.

Overall, it is a great meal with affordable price. Hard to find a unique western stall that offered Rosti."
"food getting worse,  cashier give best attitude in the world  until u never forget."
I chance upon this place randomly and the portion is really good but for some reasons I cannot get any connection to make online payment.
Nice taste especially the sausage
"Food is great, just that the plastic cutlery can be challenging to use, will be good if there is an option to choose add on rosti which currently it must be a set.

The coffee shop itself can be crowded at peak hours, and ceiling lights is too bright and can feel hot if u sit below those seats, it is basically a place where u eat and just go, don't think ab sitting down to chill."
"The rosti was bangin. You'll never find rosti of this standard at ~12 SGD in Singapore. Would come again.

I didn't like the disposable cutlery though. It was okay when eating the rosti but it felt flimsy when I was cutting the sausage or chicken."
"Decent western food, albeit slightly pricey. That said, large portions of carbos are being served, so one will never walk away feeling hungry."
"Overall 4.5 stars,  had the Pacific Dory Fish roseti.
portion size is good - as a big eater myself, 1 plate is enough.
Fish is thick as per picture... even tho is $14.30, worth the price.
Do come by and try if you happen to be nearby !"
"Came here for the rosti, pairing with teriyaki chicken and garlic sausage. While the rosti is still decent after dabao (can't expect it to be still crispy), sausage is good as well. I can't say so for the teriyaki chicken, while the chicken is well seared, the sauce totally slaughtered the whole dish. It was so overly salty that it exceeds my 1 month's worth of sodium intake.
Previously had their fried dory fish at the coffeeshop, it was dry as a desert. Plus their plastic cutleries, it was really annoying to fork or cut anything. Definitely will not recommend their fried dishes."
"Chicken cutlet is over done, stiff and dry. French fries is soggy, to make things worst, plastic cutlery. It's challenging to cut and even to fork the fries. Taste is so so, not fantastic but edible. Stall owner should really consider serving proper cutlery for dine in patrons, i can live with the recycle material plate. Overall can be better."
"Favorite western food place!!!! I visit the place often and always leave feeling satisfied. Highly recommend. Huge portions too and delicious menu  Please continue selling, i will support ^^"
"Best local rosti you can find in Singapore. Generous portion with qiaqia rosti, crispy on the outside. Sour cream goes well, is light not too jelat. Yumz, can't wait to come back again."
"I really really like the rosti.... is almost as good as the other popular Swiss place... :)  If you are around the area,... drop in and try.  No regrets."
The Roesti was as good as the Swedish restaurant I went to but about half the price and not oily. It was a coffee shop so slightly to the warm side.
I love the rosti and how huge the portion is with chicken chop. It's delicious but it can be really oily. The aglio olio tasted pretty good too. Is worth the price for the good food.
"Been going here for a long time. Over ten years. They have maintained the quality and portion of the rosti. Service is always impeccable and the family running the stall are very friendly. There is a bit of a wait when they are busy, but it's worth the fresh crispy juicy rosti at the end of the day.
It's a coffee shop and atmosphere is OK. Sit outside for a cool breeze.
It's $9.90 for a rosti with cheese sausage and the portion is very filling. To compare, as of today, marche is selling just the rosti for $13.50.
Affordable and delicious. I look forward to coming back each time"
Good portion size. Will be great if rosti is a little less oily. Otherwise everything is great!
Had the pork chop with rostie for lunch. I was quite impressed to found a nice rostie at neighbourhood coffee shop. Super nice and I will go again tmr.
Probably the best ribeye steak I ever had from a hawker stall. The Roesti is a must try if you have a chance.
"I love ivan's but they seemed to be close all the time these days, anybody know what happen? 3 times i went this week from bishan but all 3 times they were closed

edit: Had Ivan's on Sunday 14/7 was very good af quality is still there, back to 5 stars!

ps, could have put a sign up or something so infrom why you were closed, not everyone follows your on facebook!"
"Rosti is good , better than Marche .
Service with a smile 
We came all the way and it's closed but still willing to take our last order 
My boy love  his ribeye "
Lady staff at the counter has VERY bad attitude. We don't owe you anything and don't deserve such treatment. Continue like this and soon you'll close shop.
Ordered their rosti mushroom chicken chop. Add on snail sausage. It's good. A 4.3 star. At least I can see mushroom on the sauce . Though the snail sausage is average. I will try their garlic n cheese sausage next time . The paste look nice too. By looking at it should be better than kk teppanyaki I reviewed last week. Will try their spaghetti the next time.
"Very good food for the price,  and generous portion.  I can't finished mine. Highly recommended budget and great standard food. Especially, their pacific dory, very fresh and big serving."
"Ordered teriyaki chicken, their sauce is nice. Cost 7.90 pretty good price for western food"
"Great food! Portion size is pretty big and everything was packed well. Got the rosti with chicken parmigiana & added an egg. Sour cream was mild but overall everything was tasty.

First grab order via grabdelivery"
Grab driver's recommendation. it's rosti so I was excited to give it a try! It didn't disappoint. Big portion and generous with the sauces (sour cream  & tartare sauce). Huge chunk of dory and crispy rosti. Will be back to try other dishes :)
"Food not too bad
Big portion
Will visit again"
Rosti is a must try 
"Rosti portions were generous. Lightly crispy on the surfaces, soft inside. NZ beef steak medium rare was soft and tender with the right done-ness. Crispy dory fillet was huge as well, with mostly the fish meat and very thin crispy outer layer. Cheesy chicken and mushroom chicken were above the average coffee shop western food. Strongly recommended for good quality western food for reasonable prices."
Ribeye is tender and soft but the sauce is bit salty for my liking. Garden salad is good.
Yummy rosti and nice steak
Awesome rosti
Rosti with sausage and egg was very filling and worth the price.
It's not easy to find a stall selling rosti in coffee shops. The rosti and fried dory is good.
"Came here for the Rosti and it was decent, can't complain too much for this price. Though they could have given more sour cream and the snail sausage was pretty meh (not flavoured well). The ribeye steak was cooked pretty on point (medium rare), which is pretty impressive considering most coffeeshop western stalls have the tendency to overcook it. Only minor issue is the black pepper sauce is a tad too salty, but it does pairs well with the butter rice."
"The rosti is not dry enough for me. Feels mushy on the inside.
But the portion size is big and their chicken cutlet and chicken chop is not bad.

Worth to try ? Yes
Worth to come back? Yes, if I'm nearby."
"This stall keeps appearing on my google maps. Hence, I have to try. Unfortunately, didn't see that their rosti is famous. But their fish and chips is not bad as well. Tried their rosti, abit too jelat for 1 person to finish. Might want to get someone to share it with."
One of the best Roesti in Singapore! Good value  a must try!
"Great Steak & Rosti, and Teriyaki Chicken Chop n Chips. Always good quality and fast friendly service.

Becoming the go-to for weekend delights since it is a guarantee to be the same delicious taste and quality"
"Had the rosti with Snail Pork Sausage ($11). Rosti, big chunk of shredded potato, some part salty, some part bland but the exterior crisp and burned is okay. The soft mushy inner make it easy to bite. Quite filling. I like the tasty mushroom gravy over the cold sour cream. Pork sausage is juicy and savoury. Sunny side up is standard but yolk not runny enough. Overall, nice ba."
"The rosti with teriyaki chicken chop provided a satisfying portion size, though it didn't lean towards being overly generous. What stood out were the nuanced flavors; the sour cream with its lemony undertone offered a delightful twist, while the teriyaki sauce, albeit slightly sweet, added a tasty dimension to the dish.

Service-wise, I was fortunate to arrive during a less busy period, avoiding any substantial wait times. However, the limited seating might be a concern during peak hours.

Noteworthy operational details include Ivan's Carbina's closure on Mondays and last orders being taken at 8:45, typically until items are sold out.

In summary, it has unique flavors and decent portion sizes. With a few adjustments, particularly in seating availability, it could elevate the overall dining experience even further."
The standard of food has dropped drastically recently. The rosti is slightly burnt on the outside and too dry inside. Salmon with soggy skin. Quite disappointed with the recent visit after patronising this stall for a few years.
"I've been a frequent visitor for a while now, and I'm always impressed by their consistently delicious food.

Their cheesy chicken cutlet is an absolute must-try. The crispy exterior gives way to tender, juicy chicken, and the cheese adds a delightful gooeyness that ties everything together.

Their roesti is equally fantastic. It's perfectly cooked, with a satisfyingly crisp exterior and fluffy interior. The flavours are simple yet delicious, and the portion size is generous.

Do note that extra portions of sour cream are chargeable."
"Decent food, but big portions so thats a plus
The queue was long, but on hindsight i think its a soso; got chicken parmigiana w rosti but chicken was abit too fried. The potato was soft which I kinda liked, but the pan fried crispiness was lacking for a rosti

If i didnt go to this place specifically to try their rosti, maybe I'd give it 3.8~4stars

Btw for those who wanna try still, note that they close quite early (i guess its that popular, so dont go after 8pm xD)"
"Fast moving queue. Lady was quick to take the order and payment.

Felt the food was rushed as the outside was not crispy & even had burnt bits hence the inside was too mushy. Sour cream was not to my liking as well, tasted sweet instead of sour.

Price is still cheaper compared to restaurants. Can use CDC Vouchers!"
"I've always enjoyed Ivan's Carbina and its rosti, having eaten it even before it became more famous.

Writing this review, to let people know to call Ivan's Carbina to confirm if the food order has gone through, especially with Foodpanda."
Rosti is pretty decent. Chicken is abit bland. Plate used is really flimsy.
"One of the best fish and chips and rosti i had in Singapore! We were served with a big piece of fish filet, the crispy batter, the succulent fish, slightly soggy but yet crisp outer of the chips makes it an excellent dish!"
"Great place for rosti. The quality of their rosti is actually comparable to other bigger players, but at a fraction of the price.

The store does get crowded during peak hours. However, the stall owners are friendly and welcoming.

PS: They do limit amount of utensils and sauces you can take due to cost which are stated on the stall itself"
The chicken cutlet is off a good size and nice. But the fries given are cold. The coffeeshop is not big so may be a challenge to get antable during peak hours. It is under the car park.
Value for money and also good serving size. I had the Sirloin with Rosti and the Fried Dory. The Rosti was really something to shout about!! Thanks!!
"Hidden gem in Woodlands. I haven't been to M****e for rosti ever since I discovered this stall. Value for money and generous portion, though I wished their rosti can be more dense and crispy. Cheesy chicken cutlet is my go-to. Get their garlic mayo! Very tasty sauce that goes well with any fried stuff."
Not worth the hype. Chicken chop is average only. Butter rice tasted like salted rice
Better than marche
High class western food @ coffeeshop prices
"Went down for a Sunday lunch. Luckily I did not have to wait long. Nothing more to say. Situated at a neighbourhood coffeeshop, good food, reasonably priced."
"Located in a carpark coffeeshop, seats are severely limited which shows that it's a place with really good food.

Their rosti (roesti here) was great. A little crispy on the outside and nice soft on the inside. I ordered pork chop amd was done skillfully, nice and tender, I find the food overall a little overly salty to me. Good for people who like it intense!

The cutlery is interesting, being my first time here I didn't expect the plate to wobble as it picked it up. It was a disposable plate.

Wait time was pretty long so don't come on and empty stomach but it's definitely worth the wait!"
"Tried their Chicken Cutlet Rosti. The chicken cutlet was generously sized, offering a hearty portion that left me satisfied. The rosti, a crucial component of the dish, was cooked to perfection, showcasing a golden crispiness on the outside and a tender inside.

One major plus was the reasonable pricing, making it a good value for money. However, a downside to note was the ambiance. The food court where I dined was warm and stuffy, detracting from the overall dining experience."
"10.50 for a paper plate of snail pork sausage rosti with a sunny side up, mushroom sauce and a whopping dollop of sour cream. Waited about 10 minutes in the evening. Also had a $1 coke zero on promo from the drinks stall"
"Had the fried chicken cutlet as well as the chicken chop, meat was indeed quite a big cut as advertised by many. Rosti serving is also quite generous that fit almost the entire plate. Chicken cultet and chicken chop meat was moist and not overly dry which complements the savoury mushroom sauce. However, i felt that the rosti was a tad bit on the bland side and could've been slightly crispier for the crunch factor. Not a very crowded coffeeshop during dinner time so there is no need to rush to grab seats earlier (i went around 7pm). Definitely worth the price for the portion of food and taste, give it a try if you are near woodlands area, just 1 bus stop from woodlands mrt and 5-10mins walk."
"It's in a coffee shop, try to go during off peak hour to avoid the waiting. The Rosti is okay but if it can be cooked longer it'll be tastier. Personally, I feel the Rosti isn't sticking together, it breaks off easily.

Ordered Rosti with pork sausage and Rosti with chicken chop total $20.50"
"Visited on a Thursday evening and ordered 2 rosti and 1 chicken chop. There was a queue during dinner time but order taking was smooth and quick, and it didn't take long before our buzzer rang. Rosti was fluffy and flavourful, and surprisingly it is not as oily as compared to other rosti. Chicken chop was nicely cooked with a crispy skin and firm meat. The accompanying mushroom sauce had mushroom slices with savoury brown gravy that complements the chicken. Snail sausage is nicely grilled too. Will definitely be back for more!!!"
"Having their rosti with dory fish and chips! Big portion and taste very good for just $12.80! The Rosti is crispy, soft and not so oily pair with their mushroom sauce! Their dory fish is super crispy and big ! can feed 2 pax  Recommend to get their western food with their rosti "
Yummy rosti and pork snail sausage. Comes with sour cream and mushroom sauce. Waiting time about 30 minutes for dinner at around 7.30pm on Sunday though
Quite an interesting rosti food. Prefer the rosti to be a bit more crunchy. The rosti is crispy on the outside but mushy on the inside. My rosti was slightly charred while my wife's was cooked just nice. Hope the quality can be consistent. Overall still a pleasant meal.
"rosti's were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. mains were very well executed.

ribeye was well marinated and cooked to a perfect medium rare. this almost doesnt happen in a coffeeshop setting, and their standards puts some restaurants out there to shame. chicken cutlet was huge and thick as well.

portions were are large and filling, will come back to try other stuff on their menu"
"Rosti is Better than Marche for sure
And better bang for buck

could be even better if it was a little more charred"
Portion was quite big!
"Nothing special about the rosti, the mains was fine"
"A tucked away coffee shop environment that's at the bottom of a multi storey HDB carpark.  Their rosti is great. Different from Marche style, so cannot compare. The sour cream is generous, and have tried all the combinations available. The rosti with sausage all come with a sunny side up egg! There can be a slight wait but it's worth it."
"Delicious rosti to me, 5 out of 5 goodness. But my partner prefers it slightly more charred, more of a personal preference!

I love the disposable plates, very clean, effortless and seems biodegradable? But my partner hates it bcos it's too soft hahahaha

Portion is generous, price is definitely very affordable and friendly for neighbourhood.

Spent $10.80 for snail pork sausage with rosti, comes w an egg by default.

Definitely recommend!"
"Food was alright, rosti was bland..price was justifiable for the portion.

I would try their other dishes except that I wouldn't go back again.

Services was terrible.. didn't expect them to be rude toward customers when we were just checking on the availability and asking for utensils politely.

We were sharing some of the food so we ask for extra utensils but was given bad attitude. We were not even expecting a 5-Star service but at least a decent and respectful one.

Disappointed with how they treat their customer ruined our whole experiences at Ivan's Carbina. From a decent choice of western food to a never-go-back-there ordeal.

Y'all can still try their food la if you guys are up for rude services. Or maybe we just suay to be eating on their bad mood days. "
"Came here at around 6pm. Food was so-so. The rosti was a little bland, serving of sour cream was abit little so i ordered extra. Came here from Sengkang after watching their tiktok video. Honestly not worth the rave.

The attitude of the order taker was also pretty bad. Rude and cranky. But judging from their comments to patrons here i think the stall is ok with such attitude. Definitely spoiled my appetite a little.

I ordered 3 items, was given a buzzer to collect the food when ready. I recommend patrons to sit as near as u can to the stall. They buzz me 3 separate times for each of the 3 items. Had to walk back and forth 3 times. They took self-service to a whole new level.

Personally wont recommend unless u are in the area and craving badly for western cuisine. I think good attitude goes a long way and this place doesnt cut it."
Amazing food with reasonable prices. Quite a large portion. Located at a neighbourhood coffeeshop.
"Love their fish and chip, grill chicken etc..kids love it."
"3.5/5 stars!

Very filling! But I find their rosti not as flavourful as Picky Snout at kovan.

Went during lunch and there was a 30mins wait. Was worth trying once! Chicken was fragrant and topped with thick sauce. There was a LOT of rosti paired with gooey sour cream. But I find the sauce not enough so it's a little dry. Chicken is also okok size nothing special.

We also got their special sausage at $4.50 which was bursting with flavour!

But they use styrofoam plates which is not good for the environment. Your fork and knife alr reusable why need disposable plates?

Even worse, the cashier refused to give an extra plate for a lady with her child. Do you need to cut costs so much cannot give 1 more plate for your own customer? "
"Food is priced fairly as not my first time trying. Despite calling a few times and no one picking up, decided to take a 30mins drive over. I can accept that business is busy or food is sold out. I am disappointed that stuff is being rude towards me."
nice western stall in small coffeeshop. rosti is decent. but Abit expensive to eat often... portion of chicken can be bigger
"First time here after seeing it on tiktok. Ordered the black pepper lamb with rosti and chicken chop w mushroom sauce with rosti. waited for about 30 minutes. food was pretty decent.

Rosti 8/10:
potatoes in the rosti was very thick and it gave a good texture despite the outside not being too crispy. The cream however had little to no taste.

Chicken 9/10:
was pretty well cooked nothing to complain

pork chop 6/10:
The pork chop itself without the sauce was pretty underwhelming. It had no flavour and was slightly on the tough side. With the sauce it was still okay"
"Service staff seems Abit cranky, rosti portion size is big but it tastes meh. Very plain tasting. Saving grace was the portion and sauces. Overall would not really come here again"
"Goodness.
So much different from the reviews!
I wont trust google review anymore.
Come all the way to try.
Food horrible n price is on high side @ old dirty coffeeshop
Highly not recommended!"
Really good rosti at affordable price. The proteins that came with it was substantially sized and well cooked. Rosti portion was generous too. The residents around this area are lucky! Go support them!!
"i came across this place on instagram, and went to try the next day since i was in woodlands!

i ordered the rosti with crispy chicken cutlet ($10) and added an egg ($0.70)

very crispy rosti that goes well with the sour cream, and the chicken cutlet is super BIG and also very juicy and crispy!!!!!
the egg was well-cooked and look at the flowy egg yolk 

overall, it was a hearty and filling meal and i enjoyed it! 
i will be back to try the sausagesss "
"Sorry I did not order from this store but Google brought me to this coffee shop. Ordered from a vegetarian store in this coffee shop, the vegetarian food is great!"
"Revisit. Roesti is perfect and not many place available. I tried thier mash potatoes, homemade type with creamy texture, better than a lot of other chain in the mall. One of the ""go to"" western in the north!"
"rosti is surely worth a try for its price point, well cooked and sausage is nicely cooked too. Mains are all around $9.80-$10.80 but the star of the show, surprisingly...is their chicken chop with fries and mashed potatoes.... fries well seasoned and cooked, mashed potatoes are great in texture and taste too, and the best part of it is their mushroom sauce... comes with sliced mushrooms and its very fragrant! add on $0.50 for another small cup of mushroom sauce. Aglio olio is also cooked well but missing the chilli padi/chilli flakes that make aglio olio taste like aglio olio.

located in a understated foodcourt and definitely coming back....for the chicken chop."
"Decent Rosti at a great price.

Ordered the black pepper chicken chop rosti. Rosti was fairly fluffy and tasty. Chicken chop was pretty run of the mill. Portion was decently sized as well.

For ~$10 this is a great price."
"Rosti never disappoints. Pretty worth imo, 1 rosti meal usually makes me pretty full. My stomach's small though."
"Not bad.. hardly seen any rosti at coffeeshop.
Portion quite filing for chicken cutlet.."
Hen Hao Chi. 
"Hidden at the first floor of a multi-storey carpark is Ivan's Carbina. If I didn't google on places to eat in the north, I would not have come across this gem.

I had the snail pork rosti and it did not disappoint. The rosti was freshly made with potatoes and the taste on its own was good enough. Coupled with the snail pork which was slightly charred to give a better taste; the dish was overall delicious! A good choice if u feel like having a rosti but want to control your expenses."
Really really good Roesti! Portion is value for money. Can taste the potato and charred taste
"Food is nice but extra sauce need $$.

Rostis are tastey"
"Late lunch earlier today, and this Ribeye steak with Rosti  very nice & did not disappoint!

Lots of Sour Cream, most importantly the beef  was cook to Medium doneness as requested, perfect texture & the Rosti is amazing too, very big portion to fill me up! 

The lady boss was super friendly, took my order with a smile and greetings, this is highest level standards within a small coffee shop that's not prominently situated as it's hidden within hdb blocks & further away from main road.

This is by far the best outside food I ate this entire year while working all around Singapore! Highly recommended if you like Rosti, western food and nearby Woodlands 

I will give 10 big  to your Google Reviews if allowed!  Definitely will return to eat again when I'm around your area. Thanks for the great food & please keep it up as I'll be recommending you on Tiktok too! "
"Located in a nuce and quiet locale in Woodlands. Would have preferred the rosti to be abit more crispier, but personal preference tho. Pretty decent food."
Food was ok

"Have tried this a few times and personally recommend rosti + snail pork sausage!
Rosti + Chicken Parmigiana is nice too, but abit lacking in cheese"
"Western food in a hawker atmosphere is becoming pretty common in Singapore. I first tasted rosti in Marche but after a tip from a friend, I can now enjoy it at a coffee shop in Woodlands. We had rosti with snail sausage plus fried egg and rosti with pork chop. Both are delightfully good, although the sausage is a bit dry but flavorful.  They use Idaho potatoes for the rosti. (I inferred from the Idaho potatoes boxes label in front of the stall.) The serving was quite fast, too, considering it was a Friday dinner. Will definitely come again."
"Rosti, sauce and sausage was bland but plus points for fresh rosti, can be better by upping sauce game or better sausage. Place is quite ulu and not optimal so I'll reconsider making the trip there."
Food are Ok.
Still as delicious as before... keep it up!!
Second time trying not as good as the first.The first time tried the steak at medium rare it was pink and tender really awed by it.The rosti was kind of overrated  preferred the crispy fries instead.This time tried the chicken with mushroom sauce it taste not bad just that the chicken taste kind over burnt as compared to the first time.The queue is as busy as previously most of the seats taken at the coffee shop.The mashed potato does not comes with sauce which is unique.The cream taste kind of it make the overall dish too heavy as the coleslaw ran out of stock.
I want to give a 6/5 but not an option. The food was great for coffee shop food and was more like eating at a restaurant. The sauce was also nice
Food is good. Would come back again.
"Rosti was affordable and had a lot of side pairings available, however it was a little on the mushier side. Would rate it 7/10. CDC vouchers accepted here (its sticker was placed in an obscure location). Detailed food review in photo's caption."
"Had lunch here...
Ordered a pork chop rosti plus coleslaw and egg.

Food wise, above average. Pork is well cooked but the cut is slightly on the dry side. Coleslaw costs $2 for add-ons.

Rosti had a great taste and nicely done.

Ample parking at multi-storey HDB car park.

Overall, above average but price is slightly on the higher side.

Good for those who are tired of the usual hawker fare and wish to indulge in somethg Western."
"My wife and cousin like rosti and found this place through Ms. Tham Chiak's recommended, And we came here to have a go at it.

They are very generous with the rosti, the chicken chop is succulent, and snail sausage is nice.

Price is reasonable for the portion and quality they served.

Service is prompt even during the peak dinner period."
"Taste was acceptable, although pricing was on the higher side.

The potato strips in the rosti was thick, and they fell apart easily. Because of how the thick the shredded potato was, it adversely affected the texture. Crispiness could have been better. The sour cream has a very pronounced lemon acidity, which did not go well with the rosti."
"Rosti was not bad (in a coffee shop), loved the fish with the pasta"
Very good quality rosti and sausage for a hawker establishment. Paid $9.80 for chicken sausage rosti. The amount of tosti was generous. However don't expect it to be the best quality. Some edges were pretty burnt and the insides tended to be mushy. But overall worth a try if you're around the area.
One of the best rosti around... their chesse cutlet is huge....
Food portion had shrink and price had also increased.
"Rosti was soso only but the service was bad & the food was expensive for an ulu coffeeshop.
Was there on 28 Jan, Sat around 7pm & the lady taking the order was rude. Act one English very good & insisting ppl to pronounce the chicken sausage name in proper English. Like seriously? Is it necessary? This is coffee shop not cafe or restaurant leh. Why so haolian?"
I just love this store so much that every time I'm at Woodlands I'll come here. Today they gave me two slabs of pork chop and I actually finished them. Amazing.
"In my opinion the best western stall in this area! Not many places sell rosti and I LOVE ROSTI so will always get that when i am here  A variety of sides to go tgt with the rosti so many choices!
Their salmon and aglio olio are great too but rosti is definitely my first choice! "
Very value for money! Super worth the price. Both the rosti and the aglio olio were nice!
Delicious and generous serving will return again
"Eaten here several times over the past few years and i must say that the quality of food really dropped plus price is slightly on the higher side. Ordered the mushroom chicken chop and rosti set today, the chicken cutting was really bad with a lot of tendons and hard muscle fibers, it was also quite tough to cut through and had the ""frozen"" smell. Sauce was rather salty and did not have much flavour to it.

This place is known for their rosti and snail sausage. The rosti has a nice crispy char but i felt like it crumbled apart too easily and was abit soggy. Previously, the sour cream was really tangy but now, it just tastes like sour mayo. The only item that held its quality is probably the snail sausage, which still tastes very good. If you are keen to eat here, i'd recommend the snail sausage set. Portion sizes are large, an adult and child could share a set, however they do charge extra for additional plates (0.30/plate)

There are many takeaway and delivery orders during dinner time, and the wait can be quite long. Plus the coffeeshop is rather small with limited seats (sometimes the seats will be choped by tze char stall)."
Value for money. They sell rosti which not everywhere have. Stones throw from cwp. Decent for price paid. Which rosti came with some veg to make a balanced meal.
Tasty food. 0 customer service from the lady boss
Best rosti in SG
"Value for money, big portion and delicious!"
"The lady cashier has a very bad attitude , and food is not that fantastic"
"Food is amazing for its pricing, definitely recommend the rosti specialities!"
Been here a few times since is about 5 mins away from Woods Square. The Rosti is quite good (Thicker than Marche's Rosti). I tried the one with Chicken Cutlet with cheese over it. Very Shiok but very sinful sia (But help to maintain my tummy). Will come back again.
"their rosti is slightly better more unique perhap also due to lower competition in the market.
the chicken chop sauce is not thick enough to bring out the black pepper taste.  everything is acceptable but price slightly on high side at $7.30
i am from hougang , there a western stall - flying pan at hougang ave 5 $5.50 with 3 sides. maybe food in woodland is more expensive"
My to go place for rosti.
Typical hdb western food servings and taste.
"Salmon Teriyaki Aglio was for my daughter.  She said spaghetti has no taste, Salmon Fillet too dry."
"Restaurant quality food at coffee shop prices. Save the ambience, this shop serves up delectable dishes with generous sides. Comes with rosti (pretty rare find in coffee shops/hawkers) and usual Western food like chicken and pork chops, ribeye, pasta, mashed potatoes etc."
"found one disgusting big fly inside, don't even know if got more flies. Disgusting. Avoid this place at all costs. Idk how add picture here but it's very disgusting I don't think anyone want to see also"
"Update on 27 sep 22
Saw owner response. I am not the subject in owner response. Wasnt offered and also didnt paid for extra plate or utensils. Owner concern is valid and might want to consider putting a printed notice at the shop near cashier for awareness. (Maybe already have but i didnt see)

Not the first time eating this and I thought i have given my review previously during covid. Back that, it was took away and i gave 4 stars. This week, i went back on a dinner time. Crowd is reasonable but i am eating in. Giving 3 stars as eating in is not conclusive. I have family of 3 with me but they dont provide sharing plates which is hard and they are abit reluctant to give spare utensils too. Family who want to share with extra plates needs to take note. Otherwise the rosti and food do taste well and price is reasonable."
Reasonable priced rosti
Think this was $13.80. Worth it. Rosti super fresh and nice and made to order
"Value for money rosti! Yums, cravings completely satisfied. They use good quality disposables, but I always bring my own takeaway containers. Ivan's Carbina is always accommodating towards my odd sized containers! Will always come back!"
"Reasonably-priced and good. No need to take a trip to Marche for a Rosti. The Rosti here is good, crispy on the surface but moist in the middle."
"Ivan's Carbina is known for its roesti, which has always been delicious and crispy. It usually comes with sour cream, but one can request for it to be removed as well.

The roesti is still crispy and tasty, however it was slightly soggy this time round unfortunately.

Portion size is quite large, we had one roesti each and were very full even though we didn't manage to finish our portions.

Would come back again, and hopefully it'll be less soggy next time!"
Good for a quick fix for western food.
"Chic is ok. Rosti... the cooking seems uneven, some part a but under-cooked, also the salt not well spread"
"Impatient and rude to customers, what more to say."
"The fried dory fish is good and portion is big. The mushroom chicken is also good, additional sauce cost 30cents more. I would actually get it though because it's really good but don't wanna disturb already because the auntie was getting impatient twice when we were thinking what to get(first-time here) and when I asked for extra sauce. Well since they are understaffed and wanna be efficient, I understand of their such services but we still don't feel good. The aglio olio no chilli but I think it's fine. They serve fast but the rosti not cooked enough that day, my another friend who is a regular also said the same."
"This place was so hard to find.  The kopitiam is actually located in the multistory carpark, right along the back wall. The rosti was quite good, but not quite crispy and salty enough. I also really regretted ordering the snail sausage. It's just regular sausage in a spiral shape, and completely not worth the $5+. The mushroom sauce with chicken combination is the only one I would recommend. If you live nearby, then it's not a bad choice to satisfy a rosti craving. But otherwise it's not worth the travel."
"The western here is good, try the crispy chicken and rosti, $10.80 when i came here"
"Foodwise not bad.
Portion is not bad.
However, the long haired younger and bigger size aunty taking orders is bordering on rude. Note that not everyone is as familiar with your food menu as you and also maybe not so  precise in placing a food order that you expect to hear. Even the table cleaning elderly aunty has better manners.
Not recommended. Not visiting again too."
The freshness of the NZ ribeye steak was outstanding and the accompanying roesti was nicely done.
" Just visited this again , however standard drop, potatoes become more powdery. I think they cut cost or want to make more profit. It use to be good now after eating I can't even finish and force it in . 14 June 2022. Maybe they become more popular and thus ...not sure but what a waste . Hopefully I can find another place that give them a run for thier money.

The Rosti just as I expected,  the right texture. The right choice of potatoes .  The prices I think a bit more expensive and portions small. I think so far Peri Peri at Woodland still value for money. Anyway it is still not too bad. I hope they either reduced price or increase the portion. Then you see long que. Otherwise let it be. . I use to eat at Marche that another more expensive place but ambient is there. "
"Affordable and tasty as expected of Rosti, has the sausage and egg set. Real quick waiting times and recommended"
Nice rosti with snail and garlic sausage
Very enjoyable snail pork sausage rosti @ $10.20.  Used CDC voucher for payment.
Great rosti! Chicken chop and mushroom sauce were great!
"One of the best food in Woodlands, that is within walking distance from Woodlands MRT. The potato in roesti tastes fresh and complements with the sour cream well. Mushroom chicken chop is decent except it lacks the juiciness from the chicken. Moreover, the price of their food has become increasingly steeper nowadays "
"Ivan's Carbina is one of the hidden gems of Woodlands that never fails to make it to my recommendations list whenever friends ask me what to eat in the North. Rosti is incredibly labour-intensive and tedious to make, and they make it good - I'm grateful they do so I can keep recommending this place over Marche any day."
"Their rosti is accompanied with a sunny-side up egg and a sausage (or side dish) of your choice. Crispy and comparable to the rosti that Marche is famed for. Honorable mention goes to their chicken parmigiana as well, which is coated with a generous layer of melted cheese. However, their other dishes are average at best."
"First time I ate #Rosti in a coffeeshop! And I think this is the best one I've tried so far. Doesn't feel oily or fattening and you can taste the natural sweetness of the potatoes! Served with sour cream and mushroom sauce, the inside was soft and some portion was crisp. I choose the snail pork sausage (instead of chicken chop) because I don't want to eat too much today. "
Had the rosti with chicken sausage. Rosti was crispy on the outside and not too dry. The sour cream and the sunny side up (fried egg) is a great compliment to the dish.
"Rosti is delicious.
Chicken chop is a tad dry and not juicy, I assumed is pre-cooked and grilled again when we order to speed up cooking time. Chicken cutlet too."
"I'm their regular customer, however price spike over the years from $6++ become $9++, every extra sauce/plate you will be charge. Their speciality Roesti you should try but standard dropped today.

Dark sauce noodle at the side is order from zhichar stall, sometimes quality ok sometimes not ok also, a bit not consistent.

Overall, average good."
The food is meh.
Awesome rosti 
"Food is ok but expect to pay higher than average prices. Unfortunately, there's been another round of price increases again to start off 2022 :("
"Rosti not bad , just too thick. mushroom chicken so so. Got frozen chicken taste to me."
"ordered garlic sausage with rosti, I would say it's good, better if there were some salad to go along though"
Yummy Rosti in the neighbourhood.
"The chicken is good, the rosetti is abit oily to me which makes the entire dish abit greasy. I am a first timer for rosseti though."
"Had the mushroom chicken rosti. Very value for money. Outside is quite cripsy, inside is quite soggy. The sour cream has a hint of lemon, which is refreshing."
Nice food with reasonable price
"After a heavy rain, a nice western meal ..."
A little over-rated. Rice too soggy. Osen egg was nicely done. Overall rating so-so only.
"My favourite Rosti and aglio olio in Woodlands!

Pick your choice of meat or sausage with Rosti, comes with a sunny side up and dollop of sour cream.

Aglio olio used to be stir fried with chilli padi, they say they don't do it anymore because some customers complain too spicy *rolleyes*

Can make payment with paylah."
Good Rosti with big serving of chicken side. Love the location within the neighbourhood which is hard to find. Filling and worth the money.
Not bad. Will takeaway when I'm in woodlands area again. Had the one with cheese sausage. But didn't really see cheese within the sausage.
"Rude lady at cashier.first time I eat  no brown
sauce on mash potato."
Food is great!
"Friendly, good food and good service. Must come support"
"Purposely go over to try the Rosti instead of packed.  Of course taste better.  The cheesy cutlet batter taste good , crispy on outside,  moist meat inside.  Black pepper abit salty for my liking. Overall a good western food."
"Restaurant quality, coffeeshop economical price. Must try when u are around the area blk 354A Woodlands Ave 5, exactly next to the multi storey car park! Must try!"
Great rosti. Had it with chicken cutlet. Super filling
Good Rosti at affordable price point. The portion is huge especially if you are ordering meat combo.
"I think they cut cost as the portion is getting smaller and smaller , especially the salmon."
Great place that serves awesome rosti. Been there 3 times alr 
"ever since my secondary school classmate introduced me to this western stall, i have been addicted to the rosti ever since!!!

this stall has been my go to store for lunch, i always order via foodpanda. the quality of the rostis always come out good. although im not a fan of the mushrooms (its just my personal preference).

yesterday i bought the chicken cutlet aglio olio from foodpanada. the portion for the chicken cutlets are huge! the crust is still crispy even after it being delivered to my house. but im not a big fan of the aglio olio, mostly because i do not like the mushrooms haha, but otherwise, the pasta is actually rly good! just a bit too oily for my taste and maybe need to add a bit of salt on the pasta.

but overall, my experience with ivan's is always 10/10!! everyone has to try to rostis cause its sooo good!"
Great Food
"I love rosti! so happy that they have self made rosti, generally not too salty albeit some parts a bit too salty for me haha. the pork snail sausage is okay. something to go with my rosti :D love that their mushrooms are fresh mushrooms n not canned ones. they're super busy on a Saturday evening, we waited probably more than 20min."
"Best coffeeshop chicken chop, especially with the perfect black pepper sauce."
Delicious fish and chips. I loved the garlic mayo. Would've preferred if they packed in compartments so the fries and fish won't be so soggy. Overall it's great tasting and value for money.
"Great rosti at affordable prices. If you love, breathe and bleed potato this is definitely up your alley. Get the mushroom chicken chop with rosti for a party in your mouth."
"This used to be my favourite western food stall in Woodlands. But today was a mega disappointment. I ate the salmon along with fries and mash potatoe. The salmon seems like it has shrunk compared to previous visits. But it is OK to me so long as it is nice. When I took my first bite, it was so salty that I had to go and wash the fish before I could eat it. The fries seem to be over fried? It was salty and hard. For the first time, I couldn't even finish it. What happened guys? :( I do hope this is just a one off thing.

Edit to reply: no worries, understand that there are off days as well.

Edit: I tried the same thing after that twice. And I'm so happy to report the standard is back. It was great!"
Reasonably priced menu
"Second visit in recent months.  Been staying in Wooodlands for years and only knew of this place recently.  Can't remember what I ordered, but what's important is that it tastes good."
"TL;DR: Decent neighborhood rosti to satisfy your potato cravings.

Had the mushroom chicken rosti with coleslaw - chicken thigh was nice and tender and the mushroom sauce was not too overpowering.

Potato slices were a little thick hence felt really starchy in the uncharred areas, but the charred portions are as good as it gets. Recommend getting the coleslaw (or some sort of greens) to balance out the meal.

Would probably be a weekly staple if I lived around the area."
"I really love Ivan's Carbina, one of those rare places in the North that serves great food at a fair price point.

Everyone raves about their Rosti and for good reason!
Tender chicken, great fish as well as hearty sides are also available here, so don't be afraid to try out something new!"
Love their chicken chop
The pork chop is ok and the roesti is special. Hard to find roesti in hawker stall. And this stall roesti is good and special with sour cream or Greek yogurt which is without sugar. Good combination.
Got the rosti with snail sausage and rosti with mushroom chicken - love love love it! Restaurant standard at coffeeshop price. Will come back again!
"Very big portions, and it tastes great. Value for money. Thumbs up. Will visit again."
"Value for money !
Good food."
Extremely good food and portion.
Food here is always good ;) the rosti is truly the best when paired with the mushroom sauce.
Amazing rosti! Superb value for money!
"Rosti meal was worth it, serving was filling."
"One of my fav, and no frills food"
"Rosti is super good. Can taste the natural sweetness of the potatoes and does not feel oily and fattening.

Chicken chop was pretty standard, mushroom sauce was not fantastic or mind-blowing. Can consider other 2 sauces, black pepper and teriyaki.

Steak was a mixed of medium and medium rare although medium rare was ordered. Taste was still good and goes well with the black pepper sauce. Fat on the meat was just nice, not like 1 whole strip on the side of the steak. Fat was also easy to chew and break, not like those unbreakable fats that is just for show.

Price was reasonable and fast waiting time."
Really good rosti for affordable price ($7.70)!!! Im super impressed
Servers are abit arrogant but their Rostis are really great!!!!! Better than Marche!!!!!!!!
"reasonable price. but chicken cutlet is overcooked, and the lady prepared wrong spaghetti, served aglio olio instead of tomato sauce base which i ordered. lame reason given to my wife is no more tomato sauce."
Food wise.   Reasonable.. price ok..
overpriced food that's not consistently good
Tasty and sinful cheesy fried chicken patty. Got it for 9.8 with the rosti. Rosti is quite ok with a slightly charred taste (i like it though)
"Very nice and low key. Excellent quality and reasonable quantity
Normally stand there and am torn for choices. Fish and chips, with Coleslaw or Mashed potatoes or Garden Salad ?

Oh wait.. .   Shall I have the Salmon Steak ?

Oh wait wait.... How about Rosti ?  With an egg sunny side, with a lovely fat sausage ?

Oh well the Fish and Chips won....

Tip :  Go early, dishes  finishe fast"
Best western food in Woodland
Food is yummy and serving is just nice. Price reasonable.
Delicious chicken and pasta.
"Some of the best sausages we've had in years - especially the chicken cheese which is a perfect blend of succulence and savoury pleasure in each bite. The brown gravy adds another level of a deliciousness to the sausages too. This is our must-have weekend treat, we love it so much we arrange for our own collection! That's saying a lot. Two thumbs up for a wonderful home-grown restaurant worthy of our support."
yummy yummy
Awesome foid
"Cheap and nice
Bring own container can save you $0.30"
"Nothing fantastic for a normal western food store, the rosti is thicker kind."
"Hard to find rosti in a kopitiam and this was not a disappointment! Decent portions for the price and the food was good. Chicken chop can be pan fried a little longer for more crisp but taste was still good. The disposable plates got soggy after a while so if you use the fork and knife... you end up eating some paper. Service can be better too as the lady was rude when asking for our orders. Overall, good food at a good price point!"
"Their Aglio Olio is a must try, very flavourful. They are not stingy with their ingredients. Salmon is thick and chicken chop is bigger than my palm!"
Super value for money with large portion sizes and it's deliciousness
Rosti in the heartlands! And the best fish and chips!
Best western food joint.
"Ordered Cheese fries.
The lady gave 2 pack of chili sauce. I asked for tomato sauce, she said Ru Guo Ni Yao tomato sauce, Na Ni Jiu Bu Ke Yi Na chili sauce, ok!
I'm ok with that. When she exchanged the sauce, the lady was very unhappy and said... Xia Ci Zao Dian Jiang ok, Bu Yao Rang Wo Duo Zou Yi Tang!
I just replied... Ke Yi,Xia Ci Wo Bu order Ni Jiu Bu Yong Zou Luo. 

Story end. Xia Ci Ta Bu Yong Duo Zou Liao. "
"On a evening of the extended CB, decided to do a pick up from this spot. Had always been at the back of my mind. Verdict? For a neighbour joint, in fact just a stall inside a MSCP coffee shop, it serves up a value for money super DELISH rostis and meats. Particularly like the pork chop, chicken cutlet and sausages. One side worth mentioning, a pretty solid aglio olio."
Amazing rosti that is delicious and value for money
"Took a long bus ride to Woodlands but closed before their operating hours!

Shame!"
The portion is big and the price is ok.
Delicious and value-for-money rosti!
Rosti is good but overpriced
Excellent taste & value for $$$
Value for money. Tried the chicken chop with mushroom sauce. Yummy!
yummy yummy
"Decent western food, they even have roesti!"
"Variety, value for money, friendly staff."
Great Tasty food
Love the signature dish
One of my fave western hawker spots in SG. 
"Went there to pack Black Pepper Chicken Chop (two sets) upgraded to rosti. It was a lady who served us - no service of cos but understandable cos its a coffeeshop. When we asked for extra chili sauce, the lady said that only one pack chilli allowed for each set bought, no extra to be given. It was an extreme huge turn-off. One pack chilli sauce for one set of chicken chop with rosti ($11 per set), seriously dont think it was too much for us to ask for extra. Didnt argue or request again but just said ""thanks"" and left. Now comes verdict for the taste of the food.  Honestly, it was just normal, nothing better than normal. The meat was a little dry but rosti given was a lot though. Despite at $11 per set, I must say that the portion was big on the gd side but taste & basic service was a huge turn-off. Will not patronise again. One star is becos of the portion only."
Decent food decent price
Food there is fresh and good
Rosti must go...
"We ordered takeaway and the portion was huge! The rosti with sausage costs $7.70 with an egg as well. It was very oily the first time I ate there, but the 2nd time (takeaway) was a lot better. Value for money if you have rosti cravings"
"First time eating here and found the place very affordable and the food comforting. I had the pork chop with black pepper sauce but found it a bit salty (maybe the Chef was a bit heavy in the sprinkling). My family members had the fish and rosti, pork chop and rosti which was served in very generous portions and tasted rather nice. Overall am delighted that this family run business is catering to the pocket of its clientele around the neighbourhood, it is definitely value for money comfort food at its best..... Enjoy"
"one of the better stalls.in woodlands, a bit pricey though"
"The taste and cost is typical of western food stalls we find in SG.  For this outlet, the chicken cutlet has a much larger portion than the chicken chop. Recommend getting that instead of chicken chop"
"The grill chicken is a little undercooked but mash potato made my day, overall a surprise for this price"
Non halal food but great in taste!
Yummy steak and chicken chop
"Rosti was too much, too wet and thick and not crispy enough."
"Went there on a late Thursday evening, 8pm. Their last order is at 8.45pm. Half of the stalls in this coffee shop tucked under a multi-storey car park are closed. We ordered the rosti chicken and the sausage, $8.20 and $6.80 respectively. They're using disposable plates and charges for extra plates. The food is good and portion large (for the ladies). Overall it is good value for money. Must have a go if you're nearby. They do food deliveries via 3rd party too"
I love it!
"A rare western outlet that sells rosti with 1 of the following, chicken/pork chop, salmon, steak as side dish. A little expensive but the portion is huge and taste great"
A rare western food outlet that sells rosti together with chicken/pork chop as side dish! A little expensive (~$8-$9) but the price is justified by the portion and the taste!
"Value for money, Mushroom sauce Pork Chop with Tomato Sauce Spaghetti."
"Decent taste, very big potion with reasonable price. Worth a try."
Good food at good price...
The western food there is nice and price counted reasonable
Rosti was not bad but the chicken was slightly charred
"Despite reading a few bad comments about the prices and the quality of food, we decided to check it out to see for ourselves! This store is located at a coffee shop in Woodlands. It has a variety of food and the prices are reasonable. We ordered their popular rosti with black pepper grilled chicken, baked rice with cajun chicken and mushroom soup. The serving size was just nice and we enjoyed the food. The store owners are friendly as well."
Good ol' rosti's and good food with reasonable prices.
Decent western food that serves up great pasta. Try their aglio olio if you do visit. Their rosti could be slightly crispier but its still decent and much cheaper than marche's.
"Best coffeeshop western cuisine. They make their own sauce, rosti, salad and salad sauce. Almost weekly visit to fhis stall."
The food is nice
Great western food and its affordable! Bummer than we cant order extra sides as their coleslaw is awesome
Great and tasty food.
Food is great and value for money... Had the rosti with chicken chop in mushroom sauce.... only slightly more than 8 bucks.... can choose other sauce or meats...
"Made a long journey here, attracted by images of the rosti and their mushroom sauce and the promise of hawker-like prices. Was not disappointed!

Big portion of rosti charred perfectly on the outside (but admittedly, not particularly well cooked on the inside - but it's really difficult to balance both factors) with delicious brown mushroom sauce and an extra-tangy, extra-interesting sour cream which I suspect they add lemon juice to. Bonus points for the fact that they serve the mushroom sauce even if you order just the sausage sets!

Chicken chop ($8.20 with Rosti) was average in all departments; acceptable taste, texture, portion without being anything to shout about nor criticise. Instead, plan for a light brunch and go for the sausage sets ($7.20) which come with a beautiful sunny-side up egg instead.

Wide enough variety of options for which meat you can choose with the rosti set, and respectable prices. Would come more often, if only it were more convenient for me."
Tasty and affordable Rosti
"Prices constantly increased but standards dropping? Its getting quite expensive for a small heartland stall, who doesn't even use proper plates.

Paper plates given which disintegrates upon touching the sauce for too long. Rush to race against time to eat before I start eating the plate along with my subpar food"
"Food is cheap n good
Other store closed"
"Nice chicken chop, pork chop, standard set with rosti. Enjoy!"
Great food at affordable price.
Really good
"6.50 for a chicken chop with two sides?
Definitely worth the price point.
Mashed potato is a surprise despite no gravy, its the 1st thing I gravelled without even touching other stuff.
Chicken is a bit dry but still acceptable.

The only downside being the whole dish is served on a paper plate, meaning any minute slower, the heat and the sauce would make the plate ""scrap-able"" .

8/10"
Food is good for the price. Menu also has good variety and store owners are kind and friendly
E mushroom chic chop is a die for.. ^^
One of the rare places you can find roesti!
Worth your money
"One of the best places in a heartland district to have western food that isn't an outlet of either Aston's, West Grill Station or Char Grill Bar. Not to mention, the only place in the heartlands that I know of to have rosti on their menu. Between its filling portions and good prices, this is one place that is worth revisiting."
Very good Chicken Cutlet! Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside>
"Rosti is great, but pricey for a heartland meal. Good for the occasional date or gathering."
Wonderful to dine in comfort with reasonable pricing..
decently priced tasty western food
Decent food... price on the high side...
It is good
Above average price above average food
"Dissapointed...read the reviews online and specially came here to eat, only to find the food utterly unfitting compared to the reviews.   Fish tastes soggy and fries are burnt. Mayonnaise is also missing from my fish and chips and has been replaced with onion sauce. Quality not worth money. At the end of the time, all I could do is to painstakingly munch on my mushy, tasteless meal."
Disgusting food and dropping standards. Food used to be nice but quality has taken a huge toll recently with food prices constantly increasing. Not advisable to eat here.
Nice Western food in neighborhood
Relatively inexpensive western fair. Good taste for its price.
Cheap price decent food and taste. Special got green salad. Plus point young man is friendly taking order.
Sells afford western food at coffee shop prices around $5-6 for a meal of chicken or fish. Has no waiters though only self service. Food wise the mash potatoes and the rice is amazing. Spaghetti is slightly hard could be improved. Chicken is savour and delicious
"Best coffeeshop (kopitiam, that is) western food in the Woodlands! Try the Swiss Roesti with Sausage."
Price is worth it for such quality of Western dishes.
Tried their chicken cutlet. Portion large and freshly fried. Price reasonable but their chicken is a bit dry and a bit bland.. Maybe more black pepper might help. Added egg also.. eggs overcooked
Good and affordable. Rostti is awesome.
"The kopi c peng here is just nice. N the western food also. I can taste the potato, n is homemade. I ordered Black pepper chicken + rosti. I love the rosti!"
Nice rosti. Very clean stall.
An alternative to get Rosti similar to those served at Marche.
"Affordable Western food, great for lunch or dinner"
"Food used to be nice, but standards have dropped, though the food price have been increasing. 2/5 stars."
Great place for Rosti at a affordable price!
5 stars food at 3 stars price
Great coffee shop joint. The rostli could use some consistency in terms of how they turn out.
I love  the western food.. is so delicious and good. Self made mushroom sauce and the rosti potato is my favorite. Chicken wings are nice too. Must try. 
"Ayam Penyet Obama ($7.80) - 7/10
This signature dish was recommended by the friendly staff, especially since I'm not one for spicy food. Also, they provide a buzzer so you don't need to wait in line.

The chicken is incredibly fragrant, with subtle hints of lemongrass and garlic. It's clear they take their chicken seriously, as there's an oven right in the stall grilling the chicken, filling the air with a heavenly aroma. The dish features juicy, crispy, golden chicken marinated in their fragrant homemade batter, topped with crispy bits.

It comes with a side of fluffy chicken rice, fried tauhu, and a portion of their savory chili. The chili is on the milder side, offering a blend of savory and sour notes that complements the richness of the rice. A squeeze of lime adds a refreshing citrusy zesty zing, bringing the dish together.

However, at $7.80, it's a bit on the pricier side. Still, it's a satisfying choice if you're craving ayam penyet."
"I ordered Yellow mee with Bakso - Takeaway and it was $5.80 (price-wise was quite decent). However, I was so shocked when I was having my meal, when I poured the noodles and the ingredients into the soup, I saw only ONE 1 meatball Please correct me if i'm wrong but isn't Bakso the meatball? Additionally they gave me too little soup and their service was horrible. The cashier that took my order was so rude he did not even say "" Your welcome "" when I said thank you, he rudely kind of threw the buzzer on the countertop and the order took too long for one bowl of bakso. I waited about 15-20 mins for that one bowl. I will never return back here again. Pathetic."
Local tasty affordable budget food menu with friendly and smiling help and attention by the family staff working over there.
"Food is good, service is also quick but major problem is to find a suitable place to sit in peace.
Nasi ayam was ok, tahu gorang  sauce was yummy. Overall experience is good.
Recommended to try if visiting east coast park, or parade area."
Amazing beef fried rice. Definitely a very nice hawker centre to eat at
These are a bunch of sincere good heearted people who just serve good delicious hala food with the most reasonable price! May Allah continue to bless you guys and place barakah in the things u do
"Picture shows a traditional kind of tahu goreng but got a ""fusion sort of tahu goreng"". This was not what i was expecting. Very misleading the display picture. The kacang sauce is more like a chinese rojak sauce. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!"
I came all the way from the west to buy the food cuz I use to buy from here when I work nearby before. I said clearly chicken bee hoon soup he even repeat my order. Turn out when I reach home is beef bee hoon soup n I CAN'T EAT BEEF JUST LIKE MALAY CAN'T EAT PORK! omg! I wasted $5.50 just like that. Very disappointed
"Terrible experience with this Lontong- just look at the pics and captions -
No effort (read lazy) in cooking preparing the lontong/ watery, tofu not fried... terrible flavor- blend -
Only thing I enjoyed was the hard booklet egg.

Could not finish it cos not edible ."
"The chicken rice tasted good. Long queue during lunch hour and crowded. The menu displayed various dishes probably will try them when in the vicinity. Staff friendly & queue system displayed for customers. Food center is handicap friendly. Clean environment & windy, beach about 1 km away."
"The uncle mending the front was friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu, bought chicken rice with extra chicken  for $5.50, the original price is $3.50, they have other items on the menu. Chicken is fresh and crispy! Really worth it!"
"Ayam penyet obama - $5.5
The smashed fried chicken comes with a generous portion of their sambal chilli & you get to have a bowl of warm soto ayam soup to cleanse your palate.

They also served other food options such as Lontong, Mee Goreng, Ayam Bakar, Nasi Ayam Sambal and more.
Definitely worth the try !"
Delicious noodles with interesting side dishes to order. Good service.
Delicious and unpretentious!

"When you eat this laksa do not let any preconceived notions of what laksa should taste like influence your judgement.

Yes it is more salty compared to other laksas. Yes the coconut milk is not as thick. Yes there is some curdling of the rempah. Yes the colour is not as orange. But the important thing is that it all comes together beautifully to create a very delicious dish. Plus the taste transports you back in time to the original Katong laksa 3-4 decades ago.

Come taste it with an open mind and you will love it!

Pity the price of $6 for the smallest bowl is very high."
"Tanjong katong has a few laksa stalls and if you ask them, everyone says they are the original katong laksa. So which one is the original katong laksa?

I believe this is the real deal.

I tried this stall, janggut laksa from the roxy square and it is so good. Probably can compete with the sungei road one.

If you like laksa, try this! They have a few outlets all over singapore.

#laksa"
"One of the few original laksa gems left on the East Coast. Noodles slightly thinner then the usual white bee hoon, gravy a touch more yellow--but it has everything the fish cake the seehum or cockles and chilies and laska leaves. The taste hits you with the coconut milk flavor , prawn fresh... so rich, you could eat it all with just a spoon"
"Nothing special about their laksa, too salty...not wallet friendly as well"
"4 stars cos they ran out of cockles. Otherwise, this would have been 5 stars.

Coconut broth is the star and had nice aroma and consistency. Very good laksa rendition. Simple, but good."
"The real deal, just how grandma used to make it."
We are always on the search for a good home made coconut milk broth laksa and this place did not disappoint. It was recommended to us by locals. The flavours were perfect and taste on point. We also liked that we only saw locals eating here which is a good sign.
Definitely tastes better than the numeric laksa in the vicinity. The thick and coconutty gravy is the soul of a bowl of laksa. There are no other gimmicks--just laksa that retains its authenticity. The nostalgic food court complements the old-school vibes.
Stall is in a kopitiam. So noisy and crowded. Not for comfy meal. Taste is fantastic. Delicious.
"Thick coconut taste but salty, I ordered the large because that would have been a normal portion, the small size is more like a sampler size. Noodles ok, springy. All other ingredients ok, I did not ask for hum.

AND THEY ACCEPT CASH ONLY

No atm at roxy means you have to walk all the way to marine parade to draw cash. I hope they can be considered and provide PayNow at least."
"The laksa and otak-otak are very good. You eat it with a spoon, not chopsticks. Delicious. The whole set including a drink is RM 12. Recommended to try if you're in Singapore!"
"Not an expert for Laksa but liked it a lot. Like d the fact you don't need to use chopsticks, just a spoon, very convenient. The soup was heavy with strong coconut flavor, I generally don't like this type of thick bee hoon I can tolerate this.

Small blood clams smell a little bit too much, but overally it's good, not to mention the fact it's a shopping center with AC. Very good experience."
Tasty. Easy & quick. Went twice when in SG.
"Not as good as before, unless there is a very very very strong crave and no budget to eat that branded premium katong laksa. Oh well ..."
"We took a trip down memory lane and headed to Roxy Square and The Red House to enjoy a bowl of Katong laksa (among many other dishes). My mum describes their version as the closest to the ones, she has had at the laksa stall in East Coast Road (directly opposite Roxy Square) back in the early-Eighties."
Cockle not very fresh
"Service is bad from the staff who is cooking, only half bowl gravy was given despite asking for a bit more. Will not buy again."
"I have been eating their laksa since young and their taste has stayed consistent.

They used to be located at two of shophouses directly opposite, having shifted twice and now to this food court.

They are located at the food court on the ground floor of Roxy Square.

The thick vermicelli are cut to bite sized length, so you only need your spoon to eat them. It comes with fish cake slices, prawns and cockles.

The gravy is rich and full of umami.

As I had arrived just after 4pm, they were down to the last 2 bowls, so the broth was thick.

Recommended! 

"
Opening hours according to Google Map is incorrect.
One of the few authentic Laksa stalls in the Katong area that was popular for the Laksa.
Fantastic laksa. One of the best on the island.
One of the MUST TRY when in Singapore! 
Terribly RUDE!!
Super NOT FRIENDLY & RUDE
It's alright. Not mind blowing as some have claimed.
"I would say Roxy Square's laksa is to my liking because it has a great balance between the coconut flavor and the spices. The broth is creamy. Unlike other katong laksa-s I've tried, which can sometimes the spicy level is too overpowering. This one is much more harmonious in taste."
"It's totally not worth it anymore. $6 for small bowl. 1 prawn sliced in 2 halves, a few really small cockles, some sliced fish cakes.
Gravy was too salty......all I tasted was saltiness. Far cry from the days they were at the old coffeeshop opposite.
Will not patronise anymore.
Another good laksa down the drain....."
"In the top 2 laksas in Singapore (with Sungei rd). Only thing is the cash out is only available at back of Fairprice in Katong V, not 7 Eleven as their sign says."
A tad saltier than their competitors but it is so good.
"Min price starts from $6. Not much ingredients but the soup is quite dense.

Coffeeshop is packed on Saturday lunch"
Authentic old school hawker laksa. Very rich flavors yet smooth texture with a strong seafood flavor base.
Best laksa ever period
Laksa is one of the best in Singapore.
"One of the nicest Katong Laksa I've tried! The soup has a great balance--not too thick or oily, making it really enjoyable. Just a heads-up, they accept cash only, so come prepared. Definitely worth a visit!"
"It appears that there is less coconut milk used in the laksa here, and that may not be a bad thing. Unlike the 328 version opposite the road, and another a couple of hundred metres down the same street, one doesn't feel cloyed after a bowl from this stall. In the bowl, there are the usual suspects - thick bee hoon, bean sprouts, sliced fish cakes, prawns, cockles, the laksa broth, laksa leaves and a smidgen of chilli. Only complaint is the cockles could have been bigger. Theirs were tiny. Original janggut or not, this made for a wholesome bowl of local Singaporean laksa. Just note that queues do get long and it doesn't move quick."
Wonderful laksa. Superb balance of flavours and spice. Probably the best I have had ... and I like Laksa.  Cash only in 2025 is a clear hankering back to the past too... 
"It's a stall inside Roxy square ""food court"" on street level near back at East Coast Rd. Kind of difficult to find.

The seafood laksa is excellent. The seafood broth incorporates seafood flavors of crab and shrimp.  And light handed with coconut so you can taste the fine seafood flavor. Two large half shrimp slivers of fish cake. And some baby clams are the meat components. The tables are clean(constantly cleaned)and the mom and pop shop are nice friendly people

They only serve Laksa!"
"Stall located inside Roxy Square L1. Kopitiam style seating. Laksa is good, self service. Went there as this store is my buddy's favourite, since childhood."
"To add to the Trademark of Originality since 1950s: CASH transaction only! Tried the delightful bowl of Laksa which is full of flavour, feels like a lot of spices have gone into it. Chilli brings out the flavour and colour even more. Hint: the broth is thickest at 4pm or before the closing time!"
"Update: six years later, still excellent.

My first time here and it didn't disappoint. This must be the best laksa I've had ever!"
"Best laska in Singapore hands down. Been coming here for years now.

Only thing is that the laksa was strangely salty today when i went for lunch."
Love the rich broth and fresh ingredients! Must say this is way better than the mainstream Katong laksa
"Janggut Laksa, known as ""The Original Katong Laksa,"" is a culinary icon and a must-visit for anyone looking to experience one of Singapore's most beloved dishes. Nestled in a cozy, unpretentious setting, this place is a haven for foodies seeking an authentic taste of tradition.

The Katong Laksa here is the real deal. Served in a rich, creamy coconut-based broth, it's perfectly balanced with just the right amount of spice and sweetness. The fragrant aroma of the laksa leaves hits you first, followed by the comforting flavors of the broth, which is packed with umami from dried shrimp and spices. The noodles are cut into short, manageable lengths, allowing you to enjoy the dish entirely with a spoon, a hallmark of true Katong-style laksa.

Toppings like fresh prawns, cockles, fishcake slices, and bean sprouts add texture and flavor, making every bite a delight. The sambal chili on the side is a must-try for those who like an extra kick, enhancing the dish without overpowering it.

Janggut Laksa maintains its reputation not just with its delicious food but also through its consistency. It's a slice of Singapore's culinary heritage served in a bowl, and a visit here feels like stepping into a piece of history. Whether you're a local or a tourist, this spot is a laksa experience not to be missed."
The Laksa in this restaurant was very delicious. The coconut flavor melts into the seafood soup and is delicious. And it's good to be able to adjust the spicy sauce according to your taste.
"I love the broth of Janggut Laksa as it is more savoury and has less coconut milk than 328 laksa. However, the ingredients were sparse for a $7 bowl, just plain noodles and soup in the later half of eating. Personally wouldn't pay for it even though the broth is good."
Laksa was easy to drink. Less spicy than 328. Overall quite good. Ingredients are lacking in quantity tho
Salty and thirsty after.
"Our kind of traditional laksa, less coconuty, less thick, but the aroma, the heebee after taste, slightly salty, and slightly spices. All in perfect. Texture of the noodle is out liking. Suggest try original broth 1st, and add some chilli, you will have 2 type of broths. See which is your liking. Highly recommend. No Q on Sunday (late lunch 2pm)"
This has to be the best laksa I've had!
Good laksa!!!!!
"Original laksa!!  One of our favorites. Jin Ho Jiak, but not cheap--$8 and $7 per bowl.  Still worth the indulgence. "
$6 for 1 pc of prawn and $2.50 add on for small portion cockles... $8.50 for this?!? INSANE
"Meh laksa, regret eating. Should have eaten the economical rice instead.
Would say it's one cut above a normal laksa at your average HDB coffeeshop but nothing to rave about. Ordered the large at 8.00, apart from filling I don't have any sense of being very delicious or outstanding. Quality might have gone down since others have reviewed."
"Standard has greatly dropped. Smallest bowl now at 6 dollars with just one prawn. (2 half)

No laksa feel. Just salty shrimp flavoured soup. Save your money for better food."
"Ge Ren Jue De Tang Tou Fei Chang Nong Yu,Ye Nai Wei Gen Xia Wei Hen Chong,Man Hao Chi De,Zhi Shi Zhu Nian Zhang Jia Liao"
"This famed stall is located in the food court at level 1 of roxy Square. No queue when we were there, probably everyone had already gotten their meals. Shown here was the large portion, the first thing I noticed was the entire bowl was tepid. Is this how the coconut curds came about, I'm just making a guess. The rempak & the coconut milk ratio got the right balance Imo, however noodles to ingredients ratio were off. Overall this was a decent bowl, but won't queue for this"
I have nothing to say but absolutely delicious
"Was there on a weekday afternoon at 4 pm. There were a reasonably large amount of diners and there were 4 patrons infront of me and 2 patrons  behind me in the takeaway queue respectively. Ordered 2 medium laksa takeaway for SGD 7.50 The Lady preparing the orders, surprisingly displayed sufficient  thoughtfulness and inquired  whether I wanted the laksa broth to be packed separately from the noodles, without any prompting from myself. She subsequently further reminded me twice to reheat the laksa broth to be added to the noodles before consumption. The laksa noodles were served  al dente and cut into shorter spoonful pieces (the traditional way) contained blood cockles, sliced fish cakes, prawns (butterflied), sprinkles of vietnamese coriander leaves and a dollop of sambal placed on the side. The laksa broth was sufficiently flavourful with the right consistency and evidently tasting of coconut milk and ground dried prawns. A truly authentic and nostalgic taste of a Katong Laksa. Unlike other bastardized commercial versions of Katong Laksa that contain addition of evaporated milk in their laksa broth as well as addition of non traditional toppings. Take it from someone who frequented Katong during it's heydays when iconic landmarks like Katong Bakery (Red House Bakery), Tay Buan Guan, Joo Chiat Police Station and Katong People's Complex, Roxy and Palace Theater still existed and were thriving."
"For a traditional coffeeshop, you can't expect good atmosphere or privacy as this Katong Laksa stall is very crowded, and so the place is very packed and you have to share tables with strangers. Expect to q for 10 to 20 min for your turn to order food, then another 5 min for them to cook your food but the hawker is very fast already. Laksa has MSG and is noodle is little, so better don't order small bowl but M or L bowl, after all you q for so long and cannot eat full, what's the use? This stall only accepts CASH payment, you cannot pay by PayNow or Nets.  I had seen 2 men after queuing for 15mins, but no cash ended up forgo their order.
I prefer their branch at Upp Paya Lebar, at least it's a small restaurant and you don't have to share table."
"This laksa is very unique compared to the other laksa, especially the broth which seems to contain lots of fluffy egg pieces inside. You can opt not to have the cockles. The chilli adds more kick to the soup but I find the soup slightly too salty. One star less because it's quite expensive and the portion is small. I've tried both the small and medium size portion but I can't really tell the difference. Maybe one more prawn and a bit more noodles? Cash only for payment."
"Overall Average.

Tried many different Laksa around the area and decided to try this too.

This might be the ""traditional"" type but it's no where close to the ""modern"" taste that most of the younger generation that have ate (1980's baby and after).

Taste is a little milky type, don't have the Laksa feel and no leafs...

Might be ideal for some older folks whom prefer the old school taste but definitely not for the youngster."
"Bowls come in small medium large from 6 dollars and upward. Fairly reasonable for the amount including prawns, fishcake and cockles. But additional cockles amounted to 3 dollars per bowl, not that worth.

Laksa gravy is more coconut centric and less chilli oil. Has good tastes. Expect long queues during peak hours but queue moves fairly fast although seating may be hard to get."
"Possibly my Fav laksa in Singapore of them all. $7 gets you a medium bowl of noodles with non spicy broth and some fishcake slices and small peeled prawns (Maybe 2 prawns) and 5 to 6 large cockles.

Very tasty. Would appreciate more if the server doesn't as automatically put chill into the bowl without first asking.

For fuss free meals. Go at 1030 to 1130am. After that be prepared to queue 20 persons long and good luck finding a table to plonk."
"Tasted the small laksa, just the right portion for me. The soup is excellent, haven't tasted anything like this and not too spicy(you can add some sambal to it). Opening hours 1030."
"Overrated, overpriced and operated by grumpy lady very impatient with customer request even no customer q in the morning, for 7 dollars( takeaway )it comes with small portion , few  small pieces of cut fish cakes and really tiny cockles, soup is too rich with coconut milk however stall was clean , ingredients was fresh no return as poor service"
As good as it gets
"I have to admit I came to this laksa place because the one across the road was too crowded and the line looks too unbearable. This place also had a long queue but it moved along ok. Located within a food court, you can opt to choose other dishes as well.

The laksa came in 3 sizes and you can opt to choose to add hum. You are meant to eat the laksa with a spoon, apparently that is the original way. This laksa was definitely tasty and better than most laksa out there. Worth a try if you like laksa."
"This spoon laksa at the basement food court really nice. They cut the thick Bee Hoon to small pieces so that you can eat the laksa without chopsticks, yes, they don't provide chopsticks.
The broth very thick and tasteful, one of the best laksa I ever had."
"Went on Saturday lunch time, there was Q but i would say the service is quite fast. They accept CASH only. I ordered the small portion and i think its just nice for me. The soup is not too thick n not oily which i like it. My personal preference is not heavy on coconut and this is just nice. The looks cant justify the taste at all! Fyi its located at a food court n other stall also has good food so need to wait for seats"
"First time trying Nyonya laksa in Singapore, and WOW....turmeric's aroma and flavor are out of this world! It's rich and creamy, yet somehow doesn't get overwhelming. I found myself scooping up spoonful after spoonful while chatting away, completely losing track of how quickly I polished off the bowl."
"The famed Janggut laksa did not disappoint and was delicious without being too creamy. The queue was to be expected with it's many fans and the pricing was slightly on the pricey side at $6 for the small bowl, $7 for the medium and $8 for the large bowl. Also remember to bring cash to pay as other alternative forms of payment are not accepted here.

Other than that, it was a very interesting experience and would highly recommend!"
A must visit everytime im in that area.
"Best laksa in town, possibly in Singapore  too."
"  This is the only store-bought Laksa I will eat. Because this is the authentic Peranakan version since 1940s
***********************************

* The story goes that in Katong in the 1940s, a Chinese hawker did not do well in his laksa business. At that time, the hawkers would carry basket loads of dishes and hawk them all over the place.

 A Peranakan Nonya lady sympathised with this Chinese hawker and he pleaded with her to teach him the Nonya laksa recipe. She did and later his Nonya Laksa hawker business improved by leaps and bounds.

 His regular customers did not know this hawker by name, but he had a beard, so they named him ' Janggut' (Malay for beard). As it is, the hawker grew his laksa business until he earned enough to set up a proper shop at Katong, East Coast Road

 Later, his 2 younger nephews took over his business and set up shop at 49-C East Coast road if I am not wrong. I cannot recall the exact address but it was around there, the old shop was directly opposite Roxy Square.

 One year in the mid-1990s, the 2 younger nephews decided to take a sabbatical for a whole year. They left to travel, but when they did return after a entire year, they found their laksa standalone store had been shifted to the back of the kopitiam or coffeeshop. Business then dropped, their takings suffered too.

 Before that, they were super famous for their Katong Laksa.   Later, they moved a few units down at the same row at East Coast Road to another kopitiam, but eventually they decided to franchise their business.

Thus, you can now see them selling the Janggut Nonya Laksa at the basement of Roxy Square.

 Part of the story came frm my late Peranakan father who stayed around East Coast Rd in the early 1950s and knew that Janggut hawker.

 I remember the shifting of the Janggut laksa shop, because it was big news during the 1990s as they were highly popular.   I used to 'dao pao' Da Bao their laksa frequently in the 1990s too. That is how I know.  We used to go to Katong almost every week back in the 1990s.

- the end-"
Nothing special about the popular Laska most have claimed. Not worth the queue time and price for the bowl of Laska. Disappointed 
"A friend brought me to this infamous Janggut Laksa, so called 'The Original Katong Laksa' @ Roxy Square. This is the 1st time for me, and the place is just an AC food court. As usual, long queue, but moving fast...

We ordered 2 small bowls at sgd6 nett each (Cash Only). Surprisingly, the portion is really small. Rice noodles are thinner (as compared to the thick bee hoon); a slice of fishcake, thinly sliced into tiny bites; 1 prawn (halved into 2); 4-5 bloody cockles; a handful of beansprouts with half a bowl of laksa gravy + a pinch of curry leaves & a tiny bit of sambal!

When we requested for a bit more gravy, the FT ~I believe she's a Vietnamese Chinese responded: ""look at the queue"". I wondered the request has anything to do with the queue?! Alas...

Anyway, this Janggut Laksa is nothing great in my humble opinion. Obviously, over-rated and worker with poor attitude! Surely, my 1st and last!!"
The broth is v salty. Portion small for a $6 bowl. Not the best after all.
"Uniquely Singapore. Enjoyed this katong laksa taste! Simple bowl that costs $6-$8. Standard, small menu place. Worth a visit."
"Ordered M bowl ($7).  The laksa gravy not 'over-powering'.  Like they advertise, even children would enjoy it.  Just add more chili if you like it 'hot'."
Laksa soup (dried shrimp & coconut) is as good as before but maybe msg abit too much as we feel thirsty after a short while.
"Packed back for my colleagues. Everyone finished their bowl, every strain of noodle and drop of laksa broth 

However, even though we bought the medium sized $7.50 selection, most of us were hungry after a few hours. Not filling enough for a typical lunch. 

But chilli, cockles, broth, noodles, prawn & fish cakes were all on point  delicious"
Love this authentic laksa that u eat with a spoon. The taste is flavourful yet you won't have a jelak or after taste. Remember to buy otah from the nasi lemak stall next door to complete the full local experience.
The laksa is absolutely stonkers
"Laksa (S) - $6

A very rich bowl of laksa but I don't think it's really worth it. It's quite a tiny bowl (I do know that I chose a small portion but the price though). Perhaps also a personal preference, I got jelak after a few bites."
"JanggutLaksaRoxySquare#01-64 (Janggut Laksa @Roxy Square), 50 E Coast Rd, #01-64 Roxy Square, Singapore 428769
* 10 Aug 2024 Saturday /5; finally had this bowl of laksa after a decade (which was Year 2014); had confirmed this stall & QueenswayShoppingCentre & RoxySquare are same owner, AuntieJanggutLaksa (without the beard tail, of course; unless got Xmas events); thanks AuntieJanggutLaksa for safekeeping & keeping this traditional laksa a heritage & for future generations to enjoy; only closer or food gurus know the unspinned tales; i'm lucky to learn from the horse's mouth; maybe i do have the looks of food gurus or food bloggers; always happy to hear families tales & it shows & proves the Original original Janggut Laksa Ah Peh has very far sighted & good judgement of people (auntiejanggutlaksa or janggutlaksaauntie) & characters; come to think of it; OMG! i might have even saw & talked to Lao Janggut when he was operating here (RoxySquare); so scary to write diary Or journal coz words do have eyes of their own; they know the owners;
Lao Janggut Laksa Ah Peh; today the gravy more on the salty side; very clumpy; i still prefer the Queensway version; even the Chinatown Point paled in comparison too; hence i always patronise the main stall; sometimes franchisees cannot make it; now i remembered why i wasn't motivated at all even after a decade to try at RoxySquare;
@nic"
"Traditional katong laksa, quite original with taste and ingredients you would expect, see-han (blood cockles) included. $6 bowl is tiny. $7 bowl is not enough. The $8 big one portion is just right for normal adult.

Yes only chor bee hoon, one type of noodle, available.

Taste is quite good lah 

Super crowded if you come at lunch hour expect super long queue, half an hour minimum from what I reckon. Come at 2plus short queue."
One of the best seafood laksa in singapore. In the basement of a small building of local and family businesses. You will have here a real singaporean Chinese local food and dining experience. Do not expect to see expats except for some true foodies that are not here by chance :-)
"Grew up in East and obviously this was one of our main staples. However, we decided not to patronise anymore. The standards had dropped tremendously. The broth is just too salty to continue eating and we feel very ""jelat"" after. Secondly, only accepts Cash. No other options. Store provides directions to nearest ATM. That tells you thing, go and withdraw or don't eat here."
"The original and best katong laksa, not the putrid sewage water that passes for laksa across the road with numbers in its name."
"The laksa here is above average, but it pales in comparison to the other one I went at George's laksa (eunos mrt).
Broth feels flat and not warm enough. Perhaps we were there too early and the broth will get better later part of the day? $7 for a medium sized quite pricey but at least there's air con comfort."
"Deceiving good broth. There was a certain meatiness and umami to their broth that I wasn't expecting based on the colour. A small costs $6.

Service was quite friendly as well. Definitely would recommend it over the one across the road."
Really nice laksa with an interesting brothe.
"Finally get a chance to try out this laksa after reading so much about it. It didnt disappoint. Thick laksa broth and tasted really great. Highly recommend!
The place is usually crowded at lunch hour. I went off peak hour and had no problem finding a seat."
Best laksa in town.  Also place is air-con.
Really delicious laksa and the broth is full of flavour. It's the best laksa I've tasted here in Singapore. Will come back here again! Worth the price too.
"Overall, the laksa is good but the price is a bit expensive.  The next stalls otak is good and selling at $1.5, I think is reasonable. Well, I would still recommend it to try."
Back here after more than 10 yrs
"Average taste. $8 not a big portion, $6 is quite small for Adult. Long queue when I reach at 245pm. One lady take order n cook and collect cash. She is good."
"Went on a Sunday for lunch - the area was packed and it was a challenge looking for seats. Laksa tasted so-so, nothing special and there's too much coconut milk. $7 for a medium bowl of laksa but it didn't really feel like it was a medium portion (see pic). Avoid during weekends."
"The chilli paste was salty, do not add that to your bowl of laksa.
The kopi from the same coffee shop is way below standards."
Best Laksa
"Janggut Laksa - OG Katong Nonya laksa that serves laksa that can be eaten with a spoon. Noodles are cut so it's not long and the broth has a nice strong coconut flavour.

Ingredients are alright - prawn , fish cake could be more fresh.

Take note - there is a long wait usually because each bowl is cooked individually."
"This is the original Katong laksa and I finally tried it. It's not bad overall and I reach just before noon on a weekend so it's not that crowded yet. It's located at Roxy Square Kopitiam which is right at the entrance beside jap restaurant Wahiro.

The laksa is nice, well balanced and not so creamy but just my personal preference, I would think George Katong laksa at Changi road would suit me slightly better. 3 sizes available"
"Nothing special but gravy could be stronger. For a small bowl at $5.50, it should be better."
"Good Laksa, not easy to find a seat tho.
They have great rojak & nasi lemak too!"
"The AUTHENTIC Katong laksa!
Served in a bowl and only spoon, the authentic way of eating laksa! Lady mending the stall is so friendly!
Broth is flavourful and truly the taste of Katong nonya laksa, unlike the so many others who claimed the word Katong to their dish but taste of bad imitation.
Katong laska has to be light in the broth yet very flavourful (lemak), with good punch of rempah. It should not be thick of heavy with coconut like curry as it is not Malaysian style curry noodles! Most people often get this mixed up!"
"Laksa (SGD $6.50) @ The Original Katong Laksa (Janggut Laksa).
.
Established in the 1950s by Ng Juat Swee, nicknamed 'Janggut', this brand is the originator of Singaporean style Laksa.
.
The light broth has a grainy creamy texture from coconut milk, dried shrimp, and laksa leaves, less oily with savoury milky sweet herbal flavour. The chunky sambal belachan isn't too spicy, lending a mild salty savoury spice kick.
.
The smooth thick rice vermicelli noodles are trimmed short, soft with a gentle chew and grainy sweet flavour. Pairs with the crisp bean sprouts with vegetal sweet flavour, and the springy fish cake with sweet savoury flavour.
.
The crunchy deshelled prawns lend sweet savoury notes, while the juicy yet small blood cockles burst with briny salty mineral notes.
.
Well balanced heritage taste of nostalgia."
Bought 2 bowls of laksa and wanted to take a pair of disposable spoon and chopsticks due to hygiene reasons but was stopped by the lady seller. Said its meant for take away. Rudes stingy and no customer service at all.
One of the best Katong Laksa in SG
Pretty small portion for the price
Staff not friendly and being rude!
It's a matter of taste
"4 cause it is indeed a good bowl of laksa, however not the best, the location is quite ulu-ish but it's air conditioned which is a plus. Prices are a little high but cause they have quite fresh and nice amount of ingredients it's ok. Overall can eat if you're nearby. I can't remember the taste of katong laksa else I'd be able to suggest which one to go to . Sungei Kadut is still the top on my list for now. Oh yes, ONLY CASH!"
"Wished that the gravy is thicker and more fragrant.

At SGD 5.50 for the smallest proportion, it's priced at the higher end, I feel - with 2 small pieces of ""hum"" and a small prawn sliced into 2.

Payment by cash only."
"Zheng Ti Gan Jue Zhen Xi Hao Pu Tong,"
"I have been having laksa crave of late and visited a few recently including this one. The last time I had from this stall was probably many years ago. The bowl is very enjoyable and live up to its name and constant queue. In my view, the laksa broth could be richer, the noodle slightly more tender, and the prawn crunchier."

"Today I went to my regular favourite laksa at Roxy Square, a new lady cooking, and she sounded like a Vietnamese speaking Chinese. As usual I requested to add extra cockles but I was rejected with a stern voice. I then suggested that I want her to pour more of the cockle blood into my hot laksa gravy. Again I was rejected as she said she could not do that for me. She claimed that I would get food poisoning but I replied that I would take the responsibility if I really get hit. Yet she refused. I really dislike having foreign cook who does not understand our local food and worst, trying to tell us the local how it should be eaten.  We are facing a erosion of food culture soon if we continue to pay cheap foreigners labour to cook our local food.
Another observation that disappoint me was that bowl was only 2/3 full as compared to the pass 3/4 full. Is that the way to deal with inflation?"
The curry used to be a load better. But I did have the first bowl of the day... so who knows if it tastes better at the end vs the start?
Best laksa I had ever eaten....must try..U will love it
"Nice but a bit salty. The stall owner is very very polite and patient, despite the unceasingly long queue. Environment is typical busy food court, with intermittent shocks from the wanton mee seller shouting out food collection numbers with thunderous voice."
"IMO, better than its nearby competitor. The ingredient are largely the same, but the gravy wins out as it makes you want to finish every drop. It is flavourful, light, salty-ish, with bits of curdled rempah.

My only disappointment was that I went at 12.30pm and the hum had not arrived. It came at 1pm right after I finished my bowl..

There is often a queue but it moves fast. The uncle from the neighbouring stall calls out orders startlingly loudly."
"Today's visit was utterly disappointing. The rich broth that has fillings in it was missing. I had a hard time eating with just the spoon with the uncut noodles, as I try hard not to get the broth splashed onto my clothing.

I always ordered ""M"" and I could easily tell it's been downsized.

I was met by the positve and cheerful attitude of the lady serving the laksa. However, can one say one still has passion with just that attitude given the above narrative?

I live in Hougang but was halfway near such that I decided to drop by but ended in dismay."
Good traditional laksa
"LaksaHao Chi

"Recently, I visited Janggut Laksa Roxy with six friends who are enthusiasts of authentic local cuisine, particularly laksa. We were all impressed by the culinary excellence that this establishment offers. The broth of the laksa was exceptionally flavorful, achieving a perfect blend of rich coconut milk and a mix of spices that provided a delightful complexity to each spoonful. The noodles were cut short, typical of Katong laksa, which made them easy to eat and enjoy.

What truly stood out were the prawns--fresh, succulent, and generously served, they added a luxurious touch to the dish. The addition of crisp bean sprouts and tender fishcakes enriched the textural experience, making every bite satisfying.

Although the portion size could be more generous given the price, the quality of the ingredients and the skill in preparation made the meal worthwhile. For anyone looking for an exemplary rendition of Katong laksa, Janggut Laksa Roxy is a must-visit. It lives up to its reputation, providing a culinary experience that is both authentic and delightful. Based on our experience, I would confidently rate this place 4 out of 5 stars"
"I thought the laksa in Sydney was good but this was a complete experience.
I attended this restaurant via a Singapore food tour.
Will definitely go back "
"Would have given 5 stars if not for when it was my turn and the hums ran out. I was utterly disappointed.

But the lady cooked with passion and very friendly , kudos to her.

The laksa was delicious and laksa-fragrant. The gravy was lemak but not thick. Would be even better if I may have some blood cockles."
Packed with flavours. Highly recommend. Definitely my favorite place for Katong Laksa.
"I tried this original Janggut Laksa after watching CNA. Honestly, nothing special nor unique, in fact the broth was very salty, not much flavour.. and mine was served from a fresh pot of laska gravy.

I wanna applauded the lady who cooked with such passion & displayed a cheerful disposition though."
Very good food - wish i can eat more
Queue can be long during peak hour. Generous with soup. Soup tasted good and flavourful. The taste of coconut is not very heavy. The laksa leaves enhance the flavour
"Favourite laksa in sg. I usually come about 10am dropping my son for weekend class, but the stall opens only at 1030. The lady manning the stall is very nice and will usually try to start 10-15m earlier. Service is also excellent."
"Best laksa ever. If you like laksa, Janggut Laksa will make you fall in love with it. The broth is so addictive, and of course, the short bee hoon can just be eaten using a spoon! Would 100% recommend to anyone."
Self-service. Original Katong Laksa but many copy outlet also. Popular place in Roxy Square
Most original among others
"Good that the stall is still around after so many years. Overall still good, service is excellent 

The soup is not as thick or spicy compared with 328. Both has it's own unique taste."
Authenticity definitely!
A lot more dilute than I expected and remembered from the past..
"Came to try after watching Food Feud. A total waste of time. Arrived @ 11am but stallholder says cockles have not arrived. Still charged $5.50/bowl. Small portion!
The coconut milk used tasted like packet type.
Overall not nice"
Very delicious Katong Laksa! The shop indicates closed at 3.30pm but the Aunty was kind and allowed us to order even at 5pm!
Authentic and old school laksa. Taste savoury. Queue bit long thou.
Good service and laksa is delicious
"I prefer this katong laksa. However, the one at Kelantan lane is the sungei road laksa which is also popular"
"It's in a kopitiam so to me, being able to get a bowl before the official opening hours and served with a smile was 5 stars for me.

The freshly grated coconut based gravy is superb compared to the other more curry ones, its fragrance works for me. No Cockles is a downside but it was fine for me. Guess it won't be my last"
"Visited the establishment on a Friday morning, and there was no queue. There's small, medium and large. Additional price for takeaway.

Ordered a small bowl without the cockles ($5:50), and was served immediately. The aroma of the spices mixed with the laksa leave proved to be a power combination. The thick broth carried a well rounded flavor, and wasn't overtly heavy. Topped with fishcakes, prawns and bean sprouts, and a side of chili, the image is enough to make me salivate.

The thick beehoon still had some bite and provided a very good mouthfeel with the other ingredients. My preference would be for the chili to be a tad spicier to give the dish a stronger punch.

Overall would recommend, and while you're there can grab other food in the Joo chiat area."
"Hao Nong Yu De Tang Tou,3Fen Zhong Wan Shi. Jia Dong Shou Shi Zhong Xin Yi Lou. Lao Ban Niang Chao nice"
"First place I come to when I land in Singapore, and last place I visit when I leave."
Laksa comparable to other well known places... but the slowness of the queue! One person cooking (slowly) and collecting payment... is that how they keep the line long?
It is the origin of all those claimed Katong Lasksa. Origin laksa uses a spoon to eat instead of chopstick. Highly Recommended.
"It's pretty decent, the queue was really long though. Place is also small for the crowd that comes."
"Ordered the Large bowl (SGD 7.50), good amount of prawns but the hum (cockles) are tiny (to be honest) which is disappointing. The laksa gravy is unlike the usual one, so it tastes rather unique with some bits of coconut or egg I believe.

It was a 45 minutes wait for it. Might only have it if I'm not in a rush and around the area."
It's closed on tues and wed
"Cea mai buna supa laksa din lume, ieftina si foarte buna"
"My first tasting of Janggut Laksa. The key difference is of the laksa soup, which is rich in dried fish taste and fresh coconut milk. The beehoon texture is also not too soft and shorter. There is no hard-boiled egg like the traditional laska.
Overall, Janggut laska is one of the best if it is not the best I ever tried."
"This is the real deal, from a native son of this country as well as his 90yo dad. The real Katong Laksa. It reminded my dad of his youth in the 1950s. If you arrive after 2:30PM, you run the risk of the laksa running out. Do come early!"
"This is also known as Janggut Laksa, arguably the stall with the claim to original Katong Laksa fame. I have been eating at this stall since 2004 whenever I stayed at Roxy Grand Mercure Hotel.

First off, the gravy is more yellowish in colour and the taste of coconut does not come across too strong. Give the sambal a good stir and the gravy is still good enough for you to finish every drop.

There are also strips of fish cake and three halves of peeled prawns. The bee hoon is cut into short lengths so eating with a spoon comes naturally.

Be warned that although this stall is located in an air conditioned Kopitiam, it is not very big and the few tables have limited seats. And the uncle next stall selling wanton noodles is still as loud as ever, calling out to his numbered customers to come collect their orders. LOL!"
Just wish it was halal
"Reasonable price and portion, taste good and friendly owner. Unfortunately they not allow customer to request for extra empty bowl."
Nice laksa. Taste quite good to me. Price is reasonable too. Will come back for more !
The real Katong Laksa. This is where the Katong folks eat laksa. This OG laksa is so much better than the one across the street. Very flavourful. It is so good that I drank ALL the gravy.
"After trying 328 Katong Laksa and Terry's Katong Laksa at Bukit Timah.

I can say that according to my tastebuds, this is the best out of all three. I prefer this over 328.

The soup is rich and delicious, a perfect balance of creamy goodness with the Laksa spices. Everything tasted fresh.

No, it is not watered down, I am not sure what others were eating. Laksa is meant to be a thin broth, not a chowder."
"A popular store here, got the small bowl at $5.50 (asked for no prawns and hum). The soup is quite light, good thing it uses fresh coconut. 3 stars as it's not bad but I prefer a stronger taste!"
"This branch of Janggut laksa is my favorite. Go at 11+am to beat the Q. Extra cockles for $2 (tiny ones).

The lady who runs the stall takes effort in cooking every bowl carefully and unhurriedly. Noticed when she adds gravy to the main pot, she will let it boil for a bit and then ""cook"" the noodles so it's well heated through. So the Q will build up when this happens.

She's curt (not friendly but not rude), does not give change for $50 for 1 bowl, does not accept any digital payments. But I appreciate her for ensuring quality - I paid for a bowl for takeaway at the same time as our dine in. She told me to return to collect the take away when I've finished. She also checked if I needed the noodles separated from the gravy."
The visit didn't disappoint me. I was also lucky to visit at The time when there was no queue. I got served very quickly. Usually the queue is half an hour.
The laksa was extremely salty
"Loved the creamy coconutty laksa soup. The seafood flavour is strong but overall still quite acceptable.

Found the stall within an air-conditioned interior. Stall was opened at 11am on a Sunday morning. Was told by the drink's stall staff that the stall would open at 10.30am on some days."
Was second time laksa there add cockles taste nice!!
"I've eaten this for decades.  Gravy is lemak and ingredients fresh.  Only bug is: this is getting expensive and the portions are getting miserable

I'll do this again only when I feel rich"
decent laksa at roxy square. lucky to find it.
"Had the medium bowl at 6$ or 6.5$, can't remember. Doesn't stand out, an average bowl of laska. The laska broth seems a lil diluted to my liking. Wouldn't queue 20-25 minutes for it. Seatings are cramped and limited."
Will get long queue for this so come early. Only cash payment no digital payment. Every bite had some sort of ingredients so it was really good.
"Food is nice. Those traditional types which you eat with just a spoon and not spicy even with added chill. However, if you are going during lunch peak hours, be ready to wait for seats and a long queue for the laksa. I went on a Saturday afternoon."
Enjoyable bowl of traditional laksa though slightly on the pricer side.
"Laksa taste of coconut is too strong, noodle is chop, laksa soup is not clear with lots of residue.

Small bowl at $5.50, not worth it.

Hard to get seats here."
"Super underrated! This is the BOMB 

Very yummy... Can't wait to have my next bowl!"
"Friendly auntie dishing out this aromatic bowl of goodness. Not as lemak heavy as compared to others, but taste and flavours of the spices are absolutely all there. Doesn't jerlak weigh you down the rest of the day. Chock-full of prawns, fishcake and fresh see hum in every spoonful. Does get very busy so expect to wait a little in line."
"I am not a fan of laksa but I ate all of this. To the last drop...
Their noodles are conveniently shredded guaranteeing a splash free experience. Only served at lunch time."
Long queue but queue moves quite fast. Laksa was ok but i haven't figure out what attracted the long queue.
Just great
"Visitors in town. They wanted Laksa. Brought them to the ""original"" laksa. Taste very different from other laksa. If you are a foreigner who loves laksa, you must try this one, open your eyes and tastebuds to new possibilities. The rojak in this food court is also good. The other stuff can skip."
"Old school traditional laksa. Using spoon and not chopstick to eat. $5 for the standard size, still have quite some ingredients like sliced fish cake, clams and prawns. Very fragrant laksa aroma, if you like coconut milk, you'll love this."
Highly recommended for takeaway as the hawker center seatings are too crowded and noisy.
Delicious rojak and laksa
"A lasksa stall of long history of reasonable price. Food quality is mantian. The place is clean with air conditioning.
Advise not to seat infront of the wanton mee stall after getting your food. Wanton meet owner shouted out super loud of his customer Que number for collection. Will definitely startled you."
"Good bowl of laksa overall. Not much protein if you don't like cockles though.
My strange way of measuring how good laksa is, is to think about how hard it is to resist drinking all the gravy. If you can't stop yourself or keep thinking about having another spoonful, that's a very good one.
In this case, it's good but I left some of the gravy."
"Nice, but too expensive.
Not worth it."
The standard not really there. Taste a bit bland and watery. Prefer 328 taste instead. About 30 mins wait during lunch hours.
Space is constraint but got good food at affordable price
"Came to try after seeing good reviews on google map. Taste was ok but the soup is really watered down. It's cheap though, $5.5 for small $6.5 for M and $7.5 for L."
Nice food to eat with family
Fav! Note that only cash is accepted.
"Addictive and fragrant laksa broth, though really pricey"
"Soup was rather thin and seem watered down. Would have preferred if it's thicker and had more laksa paste taste. Drinking the soup by itself, you first taste the creamy coconut with a hint of spices.

Queue also moved quite slow. Waited 30 mins despite only 5-6 people infront.

Won't return again. $5.50 for small bowl."
"Laksa was nice, comforting.

The soup has strong but comforting coconutty flavor, with a lot of fibers from the grated ingredients. Balanced taste between savory and slight sweetness.

The noodle was soft, their ""trademark"" is short noodles, we eat with spoon instead of chopsticks.

Topped with mall pieces of prawns & fish cakes, some bean sprouts, sweet not too spicy sambal on the side.

Long standing queue at lunch time, no numbering system etc (typical famous foodcourt stall queue). Laksa needs to be blanched fresh at order one by one, and the bosses had no helpers. Our waiting time ~15mins"
"Piping HOT Authentic Laksa!!
Generous Toppings of The usual cockles (sea-hum), prawns, fish-cakes, tau-pok
No fork / chopsticks 
Usually not a Big Fan of Laksa but this is so flavourful, I order takeout as well despite adding some Rojak from the stall at the same food court "
"as usual, likes the laksa. in my opinion, better than 328 laksa"
nice laksa since younger days :)
Very long wait . Thin gravy with little flavor. Small serving for price. Living on past reputation. Very disappointing
"A water down version of the past glorious product.

With many instant laksa noodle available in supermarkets, you are likely to get better quality self cooked laksa than from this stall."
Waited so long still not yet open for business
Best laksa in Singapore. It's even better than the Queensway outlet. You can smell the laksa from far away! Definitely will be my go to place for katong laksa next time.
Nice. Best lassa I have
My fravorite place. Middle size just nice for me.
"My go to place for when I have laksa cravings! Love the thick creamy laksa soup that's just the right amount of spiciness. They only serve with a spoon but thats perfect for a bowl of laksa like that. You can get a mouthful of gravy, noodles and toppings at one go. Must try!"
The taste is just nice.. not so thick broth... Noodles better than other choices.
A must try for Singaporean food! The original laksa was creamy and coconutty: you can choose between SML and we did small because we wanted to try other food in this small hawker center. The broth was creamy and easy to eat even our 1 year old ate spoon after spoon: I tasted very little cockles . There were a few half pieces of shrimps and chopped up fish cakes. Service was quick and just a reminder it's cash only.
"March 2023 update: Price increased by $0.50 across the board, understandable given cost increases. Flavours are still on point.

Rich aromatic Katong laksa starting at $5. Better if they served piping hot instead of just lukewarm - same experience at their upp paya lebar shop."
"Would like to eat here again, travel from punggol to roxy just to eat this "
"Flavourful laksa slurped up from the bowl, with help from just a spoon. Chili can be added to taste so it is not too spicy for those who prefer it that way. Balanced taste, not too heavy. Comfortable dining environment for a quick breakfast on the weekend."
Laska broth was tasty but on the sweeter side. Choose the medium bowl. Noodles are short so can use spoon to scope. Limited seating space as its inside  a shopping mall. Self return their bowl after eating.
"Overall, a good bowl of laksa. The curry broth wasn't that thick or creamy but it was packed with deep savoury flavours undergirded by coconut milk sweetness and mild spicy heat. It is a very likeable, tasty, drinkable curry broth. It's worth mentioning that the portions are quite small for its price point, as compared to other stalls."
"we checked Google, it said the store was open at 9am. when we reached at around 9.05am, the uncle said it would be open at 9.30am. at 9.30am, somehow the opening time magically changed to 10.30am!!"
"Ordered medium but look small. Few small cockles and it look over cooked. After the meal I have stomach ache. I only order that laksa so couldn't be from other food. Something in it is not fresh. The owner is friendly though.

If you are sensitive to loud booming sound, best avoid this area as two stalls away there is a owner who will shout the order number very very loud. I had a headache with that and was glad to quickly eat and leave that place."
Really good solid bowl of Katong Laksa. Recommended!
Indeed the original katpng laksa!  Added extra cockles!!
Traditional taste
This probably represents the good example of Singapore Laksa as an authentic local food!
Love their Laksa and boss service is good!
The laksa is good!
"This is my favorite katong laksa (there are many varieties) whenever I have laksa craving. This place is a hidden gem and certainly way better than 328 laksa, whose standards have dropped significantly over the years."
"First time for Katong Laksa, thick broth taste.  Small size is enough."
"We took one size L and one size M, portion is a bit smaller than we expected. The Laksa soup base is lighter comparatively. The spicy sauce is not spicy enough. Cockles are not fresh and really smelly. Good side is the kids can eat if you don't add spicy sauce. The shrimps are okay. Overall, I think trying one time is enough.."
First time to try Laksa. And it did not disappoint. Definitely a must try!
The broth is really yummy. I have been coming back here as I feel that the coconut milk they use does agree with me . I do not feel bloated after like other laksa food store.
"Right balance of coconut, prawns, herbs and chilli. Best laksa in Spore."
"Having a bowl of laksa usually comes with a price. A heavy, coconut cream based dish means a full tummy and possible food coma along with its rich taste. Janggut's laksa is different, as it's just as rich and flavorful as the thick bowls of laksa, except it's very light and easy to finish! One of its unique selling points is its fresh and homemade coconut milk, and you can tell this is true with its creaminess and pieces of coconut mixed into its broth. Very yummy, and with a perfect touch of spice to boot!"
"Taste is more homely as opposed to the highly fragrant 328 Laksa.
We like that the gravy is creamy, however taste is rather bland. Spiciness is also rather mild.

be mindful that the bowl may be a bit oily and soupy from the laksa that ran down the sides as she drained the soup out.

still finished it though, like a child fearing the pimple-filled face of his future wife."
"Noodles are al dente. Broth is extremely flavourful. Make sure to add the chilli, it adds another layer of flavour. Ingredients are generous. Prefer this over the neighbouring ones."
Not too spicy but still tasty. 5/5
"The place gives a familiar hawker atmosphere but its air-conditioned. The aunty is friendly, service is fast. The taste is just like before. If you'd like to have traditional laksa, a must come!"
"Have always frequented 328 Katong Laksa across the road. But from now on, it's this place I'll visit. Portions are generous,  chilli paste is served on the side so you have the option to dial the heat up if you wish, and according to your taste, unlike 328 Katong laksa. The broth is thicker with more 'Liao'. Love it! Ps: I had 2 bowls all by myself! One large and one small with added cockles.  I didn't get any photos as it was finished before I remembered to take any! "
"I hv had this Laksa since the 70s when Jangut were was dishing out the laksa. So no need further mention standard still there. Beats every other laksa ever mentioned from every reviews. I was there last Saturday for lunch and am surprised that no one mentioned about the stall selling wanton mee, some where in  the middle. This uncle with his loud voice will call out the Q number in both English and Mandarin.eg tonty wan 21"
"Very salty , very disappointed"
Better now then the (other) laksa place
AMAZING. Usually went to 328 because its more accessible but this laksa is spectacular in its own way! Lady was nice and i lapped up the entire soup too. Definitely coming back for more!
Loved the soup!
Best laksa in Katong you have to try it. But need to get medium because portion is not very big
"Good laksa with their own unique gravy and flavor that is quite different from the other Laksa out there. Chilli not so power though. I should have put more. Still quite shiok. Best thing it's located in an air conditioned mall.

Back again with more chili. Very shiok. And consistent."
"Very good Laksa, the broth is sweet and savory with coconut milk, just eat using a spoon. Good portion too. Take away cost more than dining in."
"My All time favorite Katong Laksa!
The taste is really perfect.
Not oily not spicy no heavy...
Smooth gravy 

If you come here on Sunday during peak hours (Lunch Hours)
Expected long queue.
But queue is moving fast."
The laksa is great but unfortunately they don't accept cashless payments vs every other neighboring shops there which have adopted such an easy method of payment. Please start now.
Great laksa
Good taste
"The laksa taste nice, portion is just nice."
Very pricy and not very fantastic
Probably the best laksa along this stretch of the East coast area. Soup is very flavorful and the cockles are fresh. Much much better than the standalone stall just across the road.
"I visited this place again after a long while, I must say the standard(or lack of) has almost gone down the drain.

The gravy is extremely watered down, the laksa flavour leaves much to be desired, although I have to credit them for the freshness of the prawns and cockles.

I ought to have taken my cue when I noticed that there wasn't a q during lunch hour.

Conclusion: Take your money elsewhere."
"Nice flavour and taste. First time eating laksa with only using spoon. The take away cost more than dine, wonder does the packaging cost more than washing cost"
My all time favourite !! so delicious and flavourful. Friendly service. Awesome !!!
"Visited the shop for a weekday lunch. There was no queue. Auntie served very promptly.

Ordered a small bowl. The laksa was very easy to eat - not overwhelm with coconut or spiciness. It was just the right ratio between all and I really like that. :)

Ingredients were plentiful. 4 large juicy fresh cockles, prawns, and fishcakes. The portion was just nice for me.

Small: $5.50
Med: $6.50
Large: $7.50"
Still the best Laksa in Singapore.
Soup becomes watery after few turns. Not for me sorry.
Once a while I'll indulge in a large bowl of this stall.
"Tastes good,
updated business hours 9:30-16:00
price now S$5.5 for a small bowl"
To each his own. I find it more creamy? I prefer Katong Laksa but of course their standard now cannot be compared to the earlier days. Probably they prepare their ingredients thru central kitchen now.
One of the best if not the best tattoos in Singapore period. Laksa wasn't too fishy from the cockles and the lemak was just nice from the broth. Properly seasoned and the chilli was not too spicy just perfect
Oishii! One of the must-try.
"Nice bowl of laksa. Pictured was a regular bowl at $5.. Soup is flavourful, ingredients are sliced fishcake, 2 halves of prawn and 4 pcs cockles. $5 is just enough for small eater like me."
Tasty laksa at reasonable price of $5. Noodles are cut - similar to Katong laksa. The taste is lighter and comparatively less oily and spicy than Katong's
"Stall is located at the ground floor food court. Not a lot of seating, so be wary of when to come.

One of the two ""main"" katong laksas, I believe. They have other locations, not sure which is the OG or if they're franchised.

Belongs to the more watery kind of laksa. Broth is not as spicy and is heavier in coconut than spice. Noodles are cut and to be eaten with a spoon as all 'katong laksas'.

A bowl consists of noodles, beansprouts, fishcake, prawns, and cockles. Ingredients are fresh, especially important for the cockles, which are fresh and plump. However, the portion is relatively small for its price (starting from $5, $2 to add ingredients like cockles). A $5 bowl won't get you full.

Overall, it's definitely a very good bowl of laksa that deserves all its fame.

Picture is taken after a few mouthfuls because I forgot."
"When many of the Laksa Stalls in Singapore writes that they are the Original Katong Laksa and that makes consumers like me confused about their originality.

The Original Katong Laksa was founded by Mr Ng Juat Swee who is also known as Janggut (when translated from Malay means beard and Mr Ng has hair growing out from his mole below his chi

They started their first stall in the late 50s at East Coast Road, which was well known as Katong Laksa but due to rental hike, they have been relocating in Katong and their stall in Roxy Square was settled down in 2000 and another branch in Queensway Shopping Center in 2005. Till today, they have 5 branches.

We were early and decided to bang our buck on the medium-size bowl of Laksa after anxiously waiting for the stall's business to start for the day. I was filled with joy after receiving my order as I have been longing to taste this Janggut Laksa for some time. My bowl was filled with a generous amount of eggs, slices of fish cakes, blood cockles and prawns.

Laksa - $6 (Medium)

Like most of the traditional laksa stalls, we enjoy having these bowls of yummy dishes consumed using just a spoon. The thick bee hoon is cut into smaller lengths and every spoonful is loaded with yummy goodness.

The laksa broth has a faint taste of coconut milk, striking a good balance of sweetness with a little bit of spice. Overall, it still makes a good bowl of laksa topped with chopped laksa leaves and a scoop of chilli.

For we are the first two customers, there is no queuing needed for us. If you ask if this is the best Laksa I had, honestly I will say my heart still goes with my all-time favourite Sungei Road Laksa for their taste is more distinct and ""heavier"". Janggut Laksa will remain my 2nd favourite in list."
"Fragrant broth easy to eat with just a spoon. Even though I'm aware that this is the authentic Katong laksa, still prefer 328 Katong laksa as find that the cockles they serve are larger."
"Hao Chi Bu Gui,Jia Dong Le Sha,Luo Re,Yun Tun Mian De Ben Di Kou Wei Du Bu Cuo"
although pricy but the amount of prawns and cockles provided was very generous portion. very tasty and ingredients used were very fresh. Thea prawns and cockles have a natural seafood sweetness
"Chanced upon this hidden gem while patronising this food court, and decided to give it a try since we haven't yet tried a Nonya laksa before.

 The service time was really quick, they merely had to heat up the noodles with the boiling broth, before adding pre-cooked ingredients and adding the broth again.

 Although the preparation is simple, it turned out to be the best laksa I ever had! The noodles were in really small bite size lengths, making it edible with just a soup spoon. The ingredients accompanying the noodles were generous and fresh too! Lastly, the broth was right on point, giving it just enough flavour and kick, before withdrawing to prevent jelard - very good balance on the coconut milk.

Starting at $5 a bowl, this definitely is a must try if you are visiting Roxy Square "
Old school laksa at katong area during 80.
"I went there at 11:00 am on Sunday, February, but there was no line and it was vacant.  The menu is laksa only, and you can choose from small, medium, and large.  The small size used in the store was $ 5.  The taste is coconut and it is an easy-to-drink soup.  For an accent with a good shellfish pace.  Compared to 328 Laksa, the smell of shellfish is less severe and it is easier to eat."
Not too bad but I prefer the one across the road.
"Bu Cuo Chi De laksa, Tang Zhi Gou Wei. "
Definitely worth the queue!
"Wanted to eat at the Bei-ing noodles but they were not open yet, so decided to try the laksa.  It was not as good as remembered, unfortunately.  While it was not oily, it was watered down and lacked lemak.

The cockles were very fresh, though."
"Decent taste, very creamy. Wasn't as good as what we were expecting. Portion a kinda small for the price. We had janggut before going to 328 to do a back to back comparison. We found janggut to be more creamy but less oomph. Overall we prefer 328 but subject to personal taste bud."
One of the best laksa in the area
"The laksa here tastes really good. Light and rich laksa gravy. Not oily. You can ask for no cockles and get more prawns instead. I got the $6 medium potion.

Date: 8 Jan 2022"
"The laksa is nice and flavourful! Ordered the medium size and the portion was good, ingredients were also sufficient. Although the amount of prawns may be slightly lesser compared to 328 katong laksa, but this taste is comparable and if you dont add chilli, it actually isn't spicy. Those who love spice can add more chilli. Came at a time whereby the queue was about 4 pax but because only 1 person was manning the store, the wait was more than 15mins actually. They only have laksa and my otah was bought from the stall beside."
Best laksa! Broth is so thick and well made. Slurped it all up 
One of the nicest laksa we tasted and the gravy has a special complexity. Only complaint is the portion size. We may come back again.
"One of the best Laksa in the area. $5 bowl is quite small but if you like, pair it with the rojak in the drink stall. Lovely place."
"Taste wise, it's good. The service is quick too. But minus one star for portion size. We ordered medium and it feels like a small."
"I was in the area so I thought I'd try the ""original"". Very much prefer the Queensway branch with their extra menu items and oomph!"
"I am not sure which one is the original stall for Katong laksa so i gave it a try.

Although it doesn't look as appetizing as 328 Katong Laksa but it tastes good as well."
"When you come here, must try the nasi lemak and laksa."
"Was there after facial with my daughter.
She said its good and that I should try it since I was there.
I agreed with her to a certain extent but find that the prawns was not that fresh as its abit prawny.
Overall i think the gravy texture was good.
Will definitely give it a try should I come here again"
"Good serving size, very few seats and lunch hour long queue no seats. Soup is not thick but has alot of ingredients. Love it."
Pure goodness... would have been better if  more beans sprouts are added for the extra crunch.
"This is one famous laksa @ Roxy Square. Sign said over 50 years of good laksa.

Started eating their laksa last year during the pandemic and find it different from the rest. Taste like curry, but it's not curry. Taste lemak, yes. Added their chillies, match well with their laksa broth!

One unique bowl of laksa. A small bowl cost $5, for take away add $0.50.

Do give this laksa a try when you are here."
"The presentation of the noodle may not be appetising, but it is GOOD. I prefer this to 328 Katong laksa."
"WLE! Is damn good laksa lah!

This soup-spoon Nyonya Peranakan laksa is souper satisfying all the way to the final slurp! They kindly add the chili down the side, so you can control the spice to your hearts content (I pushed the whole lot in and mixed it up). The 2 times I've had this lately were both post training, so I was already dripping before I started eating, so you can imagine what I looked like with the sambal sweats!

There isn't much else to say except it's absolutely delicious with thick juicy prawns, slurpy noodles & that amazing creamy coconut broth that defeats chopsticks!"
Very nice laska.
The laksa is yummy
May have set my expectations abit too high.
very good laksa
"Love it!!! The broth is so light and aromatic elevated with freshly sliced kafir lime leafs.  Feel free  to adjust the level of spiciness by adding more or less sambal.  The noodles are chopped, mixed with fish cake and prawns and double dipped in the broth so it soaks up all the flavour.  Now I know why you only need a spoon to slurp-up every mouthful of liquid goodness.

You order S,M or L size depending on your appetite.  Went with M size and it was just nice!"
"From AMK Hub Foodfare -- the latest outlet.

The laksa must be boiled at high heat constantly. And the prawn (1.5 pc) is what you see in the photo.

This bowl cost $5.50.

The original shop in Katong is good but I think owners should think of how to maintain food quality when expanding.

Brand struck off my list. Won't patronize again."
The better laksa along Katong imo.
Laksa is good. Wan Tang mee next store is good too.
cant get any better than this
Laksa so good! So tummy friendly that even kids can eat them.
Taste the same when I first ate it 30 years ago. Bring back all the memories from secondary school.
Consistently good. The small size is good as a snack.
"The laksa is authentic,compares to some along Katong."
Best laksa in Singapore. Don't fall for the 328 nonsense
"as my friend doesn't take cockle, it is less flavourful, do try the cockle version!"
"Arrived with high expectations as some friends swear by this laksa, but left disappointed somehow.

Maybe some like their laksa broth light on their palate and slurpable to the last drop, but this laksa broth was just too diluted for me. Simply put, it was not as coconutty and flavourful as I would like it to be. In fact, without stirring in the chilli paste and julienned laksa leaves, it tastes almost nonedescript.

Portions are small and prices are notably at a premium compared other versions out there.

If you order the smallest portion at $5, you are likely to walk away still a tad peckish. Why so giam siap? Heheh. "
The original katong laksa and for me still the tops for their short noodles and luscious lemak laksa. Crunchy taugay and the sambal chilli mixed with the small prawns all makes this best laksa fix in the east.
"They had a franchise branch at wisma foodcourt, that was pretty good. I tried this stall twice. First visit was a small bowl and today a medium size bowl. For a medium bowl of laska at 6 bucks (1dollar more than small bowl), I got 2 tiny shrimps and pathetic pieces of fishcake, granted that I asked for no clams. The flavour and taste is a totally different standard from the one at Wisma, it is diluted and lack of distinctive spices flavouring a good laska should have. Go next door to katong laska, about the same price but way way better than this."
"I love that the prawns are all peeled and generous portion of hums. More chili would be nice, was in a tiny packet because of covid but we understand! Great comfort food for a cooling night"
"I grew up with the typical laksa that's thick and has a strong coconut flavour, so this is different for me.

1. The gravy is thinner than the laksa I grew up eating from my mum or the stalls my family used to go to. This is more of a soup style where the gravy is thinner so you can drink it up. The flavour is good enough to continue drinking but not something I would crave for when the laksa craving strikes.

2. The prawns seem to be boiled quite long so isn't juicy. Doesn't have the sweetness of prawns often said to be what prawns should taste like.

3. I would prefer the sambal chili to have a stronger flavour and to be spicier. But then again I eat chilli padi plain with rice so there goes this fussy tongue.

Maybe this is what the original Katong Laksa should taste like but seeing as I wasn't here when it first appeared, it could be. That said, would I travel here to eat this when hungry? Nope. Something lacking in the overall flavour. Maybe it's the lack of a good prawn stock. Maybe it's healthier from the old days. Maybe in the past hawkers used to squeeze coconut cream by hand from grated coconuts. The fussy tongue wants a thicker gravy with more prawn flavour, maybe."
Best laksa hands down.. although a small portion would suffice
"You'll love this if you like your laksa to be ""coconutty"". The lady boss is also friendly (unlike the staff at 328 Laksa opposite)!"
"some say that this is the best laksa in Singapore, I have to agree!"
"Katong version Laksa is still the best Singapore's version.
Savoury and blend of spices will dance your tastebuds."
"Price-wise, slightly on the high side. The Laksa broth is very robust, thick and milky. The noodles are finely cut and can be quickly eaten with a spoon--average good laksa; hard to go wrong with this dish."
One of my personal fav laksa
a big bowl of good laksa at marine parade
Soup is not as thick as expected but still worth a try.
"Enjoyed the large bowl of laksa, which had both prawns and cockles. The broth was very tasty. Could do with a few more cockles."
"In my opinion, its better than 328 laksa
But the location may be hard to find for some"
"One of my top favorite laksa in Singapore.
Portion is rather small for it's price."
Flavourful and honest bowl of Katong laksa without all the gimmicks. They are also known as Janggut laksa. Standard is consistent throughout their outlets as it's comparable with the bowl of laksa I had at their outlet at Queensway.
Came all the way here from the west to have a bowl of laksa. It's over rated. Lack of prawn sweetness.
"The soup is best complimented with the chili paste. Once you stir and mix the chili well, the laksa really shines and you gobble down the whole bowl in no time."
Nice! Very good!
Good to eat but not so often as is bad for your heart.
"It wasnt fresh! We went there for breakfast, both people had stomach ache and diarrhoea after:(((("
Love the laksa! Not so lemak but very flavoured. Especially with added cookies!
I simply love the laksa here. Rivals amongst the best I've tasted here when I was growing up here in the 1970s. Typically lemak if u like the Peranakan style of laksa ! 
Its very average (or even a bit watery for me) and expensive at medium portion $5.50.  The 3 prawns are fresh and great tasting though.
Too much coconut milk for our liking. Even the chilli wasn't spicy.
"Average, sweet laksa taste, just a weird combination of coconut milk, curry with cut noodles. The look is definitely not tempting, taste is just average, if you like sweet curry, then this may be a good choice. $4.50 for a small portion."
So rich and generous!
"Thick, fragrant, savoury gravy with short rice noodles. Eaten with a spoon. Soft cockles and fish cake strips give more depth to the dish. I can taste the dried shrimps used in the gravy that provide a natural umami taste. 5.50 for a medium portion. Hearty enough for me. Mildly spicy so you can add chilli to taste.

On first floor of Roxy Square near main entrance from East Coast Road."
By a long way my favourite laksa place in Singapore. Unbelievably delicious! Worth a trip specially for it 
"Cosy coffee shop. The laksa, easy to eat as always."
Better than the other one across the road.
"The best laksa in Singapore much better then the overrated 328 Katong laksa. Very good consistency, it's smooth and creamy. Guaranteed that you can't get enough. They are doing gods work."

"Delicious. Simple yet so satisfying. Really love the prawns inside, but can do with more hum."
"Comfort food :)

Best laksa experience, broth is really good with a punch of coconut."
Not so spicy.Nice!
"Loved the laksa with cockles, only downside is the wanton noodles uncle shouts very loudly throughout"
Awesome laksa! The $4.50 S portion is just nice for me. Lots of cockles and prawns and the coconut soup is rich and creamy. It's very easy to eat with a spoon and you don't get laksa soup flying everywhere! Somebody ordered one without soup  wonder how it's like. I drank up every last drop of the soup though. There goes my morning gym session. 
Our favourite laksa stall! The gravy is so heavenly. Too bad it is too spicy for the kids. They miss the world sia!
"Large bowls are served in porcelain, small served in plastic bowls. Best katong laksa imo but I do get pretty sick of it towards the end of a big bowl"
Owner is really nice and curry flavour is consistent
"Taste good all the time, every time. Prices are reasonable.

Try to go before lunch time crowd. Some inconsiderate people would still continue to occupy the tables/seats after evidently completing their meals/drinks."
Delicious Laksa
Really fresh ingredients and the soup is rich yet light! This is the one locals will opt over the one across the street.
"Wow, awesome deep seafood flavours and perfect amount of noodles per bowl. 3 options for portiin size and can request the level of spice. Highly recommend the taxi ride for the tastebuds!"
It is better than the one across the street!
"The taste is good, but a bit pricey.
The chilli is very impressive though."
"A flavourful and satisfying bowl of rice noodle in dried shrimps coconut milk broth with toppings of slices of fish cake, shrimps and cockles! Yums..."
Soooo tastyyyy! The red paste is there to enrich the complexity of its flavour. You can tell how rich the coconut and seafood based soup was!!! We tried the other laksa shop right across the road and it just cannot compete with this one!
Sauce was perfect for me not too thick not too thin
"The depth is missing comparing to certain laksa shops. Does not have the aftertaste I was looking for. It's good but nothing spectacular, considering laksa should taste more punchy and fragrant."
Best laksa
I've eaten this so many times I can't. It's so delicious. The best in Singapore no doubt no question no challenge. Some say even Batam (but ain't no laksa in Batam).
Personally feel that the taste was just average. Can give it a try though.
You can try out with small bowl at $4.50 Only
Laksa is damn good imo better than xxx laksa nearby :)
"It was pretty good. Didnt know this was the original. Always thought (wrongly) that the 328 katong laksa was the original. Anyway after ordering, dont sit in front of the wanton mee stall. You will have the shock of your life when suddenly the wanton mee uncle calls out numbers and his voice is damn horror loud like it came out of a loudspeaker. Nothing wrong with it, just be warned. You will know when you hear it."
Ok laksa but the side show of the number yelling uncle is shocking!
Stock to the laksa
I preferred it to be slightly sweeter.

"Simple and delicious. Taste fresh in every spoon. Worth the calories. There are other food here in the coffee shop (Vegetarian, Otah, Prawn noodle, Wanton noodle, Western etc. ) coffee shop opens at 6:30am and close at 5:30pm daily for coffee (good & simple coffee) and toast. The rest open later."
"Authentic Nonya laksa with nostalgic taste, Very flavorful & reasonable prices.."
The Katong Laksa across the street taste much better.
The wanton noodle stall Uncle neeed to stop shouting la... zzz.. But he is quite iconic there lol. Food is good (:
very nice taste.
"It will be better if your company uses
FRESH Coconut milk
Thank you"
Original katong laksa really is very good! Thick sauce tasty with the right amount of spice!
My favourite katong laksa place thus far!! The soup is so delicious and not too heavy that I can drink it all up.
Went there at sunday 12pm and queued for 30plus minutes. The taste is milder is more distinct coconut flavour. Still prefer 328 Katong laksa for their more robust flavour although their business seems very commercialized now. Personally wouldn't queue again especially during lunch hours.
"Coffeeshop that sells  Laksa,wanton noodles,western food, vegetarian food, Malay food and Rojak"
Ge Ren Kou Wei
Laksa is superb
Not bad. A little too sweet though.
"Really tasty, each ingredient was done well.  Laksa is really good."
Not bad the laksa
"It's good though in terms of laksa, I liked the Yishun 928 laksa better which has a stronger broth"
"Delicious rich flavour, generous serving"
"One of my favorite laksa in Singapore.  Not over-spiced with chilli like 826.  The noodles are just done rite, not too soft or too hard.  Tasty with good coconut fragrance & nice samba chilli too."
"Hmmm. Look at the first photo.
Sure the overall place 'smells nice' but....
later I had the bad runs, and did not eat anything after the Laksa so it could not have been anything else contributing to the bad runs."
Plenty of debates over the authenticity of katong laksa but this seems like the real deal to me. I have not tried other varients of this laksa but this one is pretty tasty.
Laksa was very tasty and very filling.
"Shiok, feels happy after eating this"
"Nice laksa soup and surprisingly tastes very good.
Will return."
"Far from my usual, bit would do me good to visit once in a while. People come for the laksa so no need to say more."
"If you're coming to Katong for laksa, it should be this place. The soup/gravy here is uniquely fragrant, balanced and full of umami."
"First visit here, it's hidden inside the mall's food court.  I found the laksa here not as good as 328 laksa, but that's my personal preference.  I would advise you give it a try as the 328 Laska is just across the mall (via a bridge) and you can compare both."
The prawn soup noodles had a really good flavourful broth!
Rich gravy !
Best Katong laksa!
A tad salty but nonetheless good Katong laksa
Hao Hao Chi Ya ~~~
"I'm not sure which is the Original Katong Laksa, is it 328 or this? But you won't regret trying this Jangut Laksa. Personally, it's possibly the best I've had and definitely my #1 Favourite Laksa."
Long Queue
World class laksa
Prefer 328 Katong Laksa. Just my personal preference.
Best laksa in town is always the original
"This falls under the laksa category which you could taste more of the coconut. Though I'm not a fan of ""coconutty"" laksa, would say this is not too bad and it's quite similar to the one you get at Queensway shopping centre. It wasn't spicy at all - so for those who wants an extra kick, remember to ask for an extra spoonful of Chili!"
"Always my favourite across all stalls.

The laksa is very fragrant with strong coconut milk taste. As I'm not able to take very spicy food, I liked how the base without chilli is really mild and suitable. No wonder one news article mentioned that even children likes this laksa.

Very surprised by its huge portion (I only ordered Small), pretty generous.

To me, this is the real deal!"
Very tasty and satisfying
Come.early to skip the queue!
This is the real deal.
"Zuo Wan Chi Liao Dui Mian De 328,Jin Tian Chi Zhe Jia,Ping Xin Er Lun,Zhe Jia Hao Chi De Duo,Zhi Shao Wo Shi Zhe Mo Ren Wei. "
Still best
Good taste
"It is difficult to say who is the original, but I will say this taste of familiarity; something I grew up eating after school and it still taste the same to my palette after so many years. I just hope they get more recognition. The stall deserves it."
The laksa gravy is thicker than its rival across the road. Personally prefer this.
I was recommended to visit here instead of 328 by a local. I'm glad I trusted her as the laksa was full of flavour and not too spicy so that you can fully enjoy it. I didn't realise until midway looking at a poster stating that it can be eaten with just a spoon without chopsticks. 328 is just across the road so you can try both and judge for yourself which place is better.
Good and no chopsticks
"For the residents nearby, this is the to go place for katong laksa. Even without the chili paste, the soup is gao and flavorful. Plus the stall owners always say thanks and smile when ordering. This is unlike the other katong laksa outlets around, bad attitude and laksa needs the help of 2 packets of merchandised chili paste to get the flavour out."
"Ate here on a food tour and it was everybody's favorite stop.  Just amazing laksa.  We're going to come again before we leave, it's so good."
Was much better compared to 328 Katong. Broth was smooth and flavourful.
"This review is for the Original Katong Laksa in Roxy Square, not for 328 Laksa located across the street on the main drag. Seemed this place out because of the nearly perfect rating and yup, this Laksa compares to Janggut out on Queensway. Really good Laksa!! Janggut and this place are both really delicious! Love that this place uses fresh coconut milk."
Was average.
$4.50 per bowl.
Good authentic Katong Laksa
Very delicious! Reminds me of the past Katong laksa
Very tasty laksa.  Goes well with the otah sold next door to it.
Best Katong Laksa in Singapore without a doubt.
Best time to visit this is evening or night. As this brings the lights alive with smile on your face.
Laksa soup is nice.
"If you love laksa with a sweet coconutty broth, head over here. They are generous with prawns for the medium portion, but I do wish that the broth to beehoon ratio was a tad higher. Order an otah from the neighbouring stall if you like pairing the two."
"Where locals go for Katong Laksa. No queue, no grumpy staff, no pretentious posing with celebrities. Just a perfect bowl of delicious rice noodles in coconut shrimp broth, topped with prawns, fish cake and cockles."
Rmb to ask for chilli.
"Hawker stall inside a small food court serving up nothing else but this amazingly delicious laksa, available in three different sizes."
Nothing special abt the laksa at Marine Parade.
"Best Laksa around. Broth is flavorful and the chilli provided adds a sweeter taste to the dish without overpowering it by being too spicy. Prawns are fresh and crunchy, and noodles are sliced quite short allowing it to be eaten with just one spoon. Definitely a must try!"
Best Laksa around!!!
"The Original! not 328, not 318, not franchised. just pure slighty spicy soupy coconut milk laksa with perfectly cooked short white noodles, lots of fish cake, cockles and condiments."
Awesome. Price only $4.50
"Easily my favorite laksa in Singapore! Wonderful broth and properly cooked noodles. Don't forget to get it with the ""ha ma"" (cockles)!"
"Laksa style reminds me of Sungei Rd, but much better. 'Lemak' taste without feeling 'jelak'. Soup was delicious to the last drop."
Spoon only!
The original taste of katong laksa.
"This original shop does not pay influencers and as an eastboy for 56 years, this is the laksa joint formerly from the left side junction of Ceylon road and east coast road. The rest in katong are just fake and they pay heavily to influencers like violet oon....sad"
"Has to be the best laksa. Brought back memories of lazy days in Katong. The blend of flavors from the coconut and curry is perfect. Cockles cooked right, not chewy. Broken noodles requiring only a spoon, no splatter when you wolf down the savory contents with wild abandon.

It has been a year since my last review. No change in the flavor and joy a simple bowl of noodles can bring. 2018."
It goes nice with otah 
Cant remeber when was the last time i had a really good laksa till i tried this stall. Compared to other laska that are sold elsewhere. The soup's colour seems more bland but it actually packed a punch.
Best laksa I've ever had. Skip the rest and come straight here.
Still my favourite Katong laksa. I never understood why 368 katong is more famous. 
"LaksaHen Hao Chi,Ye Bu Gui,Xiao Wan Si Kuai Wu,Dian Mian Gan Jing,Shi Nei You You Leng Qi!"
"Basement of Roxy Square. The only stall here, big signboard yellow brigh..can't miss.

Served fresh and hot with prawns, fishcake..and chopped laksa + and chilli...yums...Totally warms the stomach =)"
Love their Laksa. Simply amazing.
"One word. Amazing.
The shop is on the first floor inside the building. Take the right door."
"Zhe Chao Ji Hao Chi!!Nong Yu De Tang Tou,Yi Ji Man Man Cai Liao De Yi Wan,Fei Chang Man Zu!Pang Bian Shang Dian De La Cha Ye Hen Hao He"
"Very good curry laksa. very light and very refreshing. Plus, eating it with just a spoon, just makes it A LOT easier for everyone."
Getting a bit too pricy for the locals.. but what to do when you're famous. Worth the occasional indulgence still!
really good taste laksa
It's better than the 318 laksa
"Had this at Roxy Square I , and it was definitely better than the 328 Katong Laksa"
"Good laksa, the noodle bar s springy the soup is rich"
Nice laksa
Overpriced and not that great-tasting. The sauce looks like it has split and curdled.
"One of the best Laksa in SG also Rojak, Vegetarian food stall and other good options. Working hours a bit short, hard to make it on weekdays."
"Not recommended, service level has dropped. Over-priced laksa. The one at Queensway is better."
Located at the basement. Smell of laksa cannot be missed as you walk through the alley. Delicious and affordable laksa. Recommended!
"Love the laksa here, super taste!  Highly recommended!"
"Absolutely loved the Katong Laksa here. Rich, fragrant and thick broth. Delicious!"
"Original Katong laksa. Prefer the laksa here, not too rich with coconut milk and prawns."
singaporudeYi Fan umairakusa!sikamoAn iyo
We got lost and came across this shop and decided to just try it. BEST laksa I've ever had in my life!! Added extra cockles and it was super duper good! Owner is very cool and friendly. So lucky we got lost today 
Waaay better then Katong 328 Laksa!!
Laksa base is rich all ingredients balance each other. Flavoursome bowl.
"Loving the delicious lemak laksa, a rice-based noodle dish with rich spicy coconut soup and fragrant laksa leaves.  We had  Mackerel otah (aka Otak-otak) = grilled pounded fish cake as an accompaniment and it was stupendous! 

Psst! The place has recently renovated and is now bright and cheery!

There are other food options like vegetarian food, pig's trotters, prawn noodles, etc in the same vicinity."
Fragrant lemak gravy. Bite sized rice noodles just the right texture. Fresh shelled prawns. Sambal with perfect combination of spicy chilli and sweetness. Garnished with fresh laksa leaves. Heritage in every spoonful of goodness.
I prefer this over the 328 Laksa. The soup base and noodles are better. The Noodles from the 328 Laksa seemed overcooked and mushy. Noodles from this shop were cooked right and al dente. The shop is located on the lowest/ground level of the narrow food court in Roxy Square which situated near the front entrance from the main road. I am very happy to be able to claim I have tried the very original Katong laksa and it was tasty! The new name of this place is called Janggut Laksa which I believe there are couple more branches elsewhere in Singapore.
Situated at Woodland Health Campus. Offers healthier choices like fish noodles.
"I regret to share that the prawns were not up to standard. They were noticeably not fresh, with a mushy texture and an unpleasant, almost rotten taste. This was very disappointing and raises concerns about quality control"
"Tasty and affordable zhi char food located in marsiling mall food center. We celebrated a simple father's day with my parents, brother and sister in law with my wife."
Today's promfet steam fish was very fresh and good! Friendly service.
"really delicious food, one of the best zi char out there. MUST TRY THEIR EGG SOUP "
Nice food. Especially love the dishes cooked with the egg chilli sauce.
Friendly staff and most importantly food delicious!
"This Zhi Char stall is hidden in hawker center, not in a food court. Hence, their pricing is around 5%-10% cheaper than served in food court. Quite a number of signature dishes, last time used to have their bee hoon egg soup, nice and comforting. This seafood fried egg noodle also good, crispy noodle soaked in flavored gravy, full with wok hei. Dishes are family friendly too."

wrong review
Great Tasty Food
"The food is really good, and extremely affordable. If only I'd stay closer, i would have eaten it everyday. I'll recommend trying the signature Egg Soup. Delicious!"
"It is located at level 1 of Marsiling Mall Hawker Centre. It sells a variety of cooked foods including Zhi Char ( Ju Chao )/ Stir Fried style.Ordered a soup call egg soup, taste not bad.The ingredients include, egg,fishballs,fishcakes,meatballs,minced pork,dou fu (Tao hu ), crab roll cubes and veges.The soup taste like fried fish soup but a little thicker, taste quite nice.Will be back to
try their other dishes.
Dated : 11/01/2018 ( Thursday )."
"Good service, texture of the rice cake is nice, different from Bedok but cai poh and sambal are dry and savoury.
So if that is you like it to be, recommended but for me, I prefer the mildly sweet and oily Bedok version."
Ordered 4 items via Deliveroo app but only delivered 3 items missing Lou Mai Gai. But both owner and Deliveroo refused to redeliver missing item and denied refund. My order no is 1636. Will not buy from this stall in future. Don't waste time and money. It.
We ate at the food court and enjoyed the shui kuey so much that we returned again the following day to have some again. The choy poh is delicious and pairs really well with the soft kuey.
"It's actually ok, not too bad, and today had a decent portion of chye-pok; where some days it's like super stingy!!

Apr 2025-
See the picture, the old lady is cleaning up and my wife just ask is he still open/selling - my wife got scolding BIG TIME!??? For what and why?
Then another lady also asked if she is still open, and also got scolding !!! And the other lady customer pointed that the old lady stall owner was cleaning...
Why is she taking it out on people ??
So RUDE!!!

BUT- it's 2-star cos I wish they would take the effort (today Sunday was manned by a middle-age, elderly man?) ... to DRAIN away the oil!!!

Look at the picture, it's literally swimming in oil!!!

If it was not sooooooo oily, I'd give a higher  star rating ....."
"The Chee Kway is wonderful, skip the shu mai. Worth it for this treasure."
staff with pink hair was extremely rude towards me when i asked if they were still open she scolded me saying if we not open wld i be here extremely uncalled for
"I went to the Jian Bo outlet at the Marine Parade central hawker centre yesterday (21 Feb 2025) at around 12.25pm to buy 5 pieces of Shui Kweh.  The seller, a lady with short pinkish hair was most reluctant to serve me and continued with her job despite my repeated requests to take my order. She eventually took my order and was very, very rude, displaying gangsterish behaviour.  My order amounting to $3.50 is small but it is no reason for her to exhibit such a bad attitude.  I will never again patronise the
marine parade outlet or any of your other outlets. Do remember that there are hundreds of places selling shui kweh in
Singapore and Jian Bo is not the only one !  You may wish to investigate her behaviour and take appropriate action.  Jian Bo will definitely lose customers with her rude attitude and behaviour!!"
"The lady at the Marine Parade Jian Bo stall was very rude when I went on 2 occasions. First occasion- i waited for her to finish washing up for almost 5 minutes. When she was done, she turned around and did not bother to ask for my order although I said 'hi Aunty'. When I asked if there was still Shui Kueh to order, she spoke in a very loud voice and said 'Ji Ge' (how many). And throughout the process of preparation, she made a lot of loud sounds to show her displeasure. I was confused but I let it passed.

On the second occasion (9/2), she was at the stall again and this time round I asked politely if I can take away shui kueh 10 pcs and she was very very very unhappy and rude and shouted Xian Zai Mei You(there isn't any left).

I feel that it is alright if she has no more shui kueh left to sell, but she should not vent her frustration on customers and be so rude..

Hope this can be looked into and improved."
"Nice new menu photos and just as nice chwee kueh, yam and chee cheong fun. Not as oily as before. Love the chilli. Shiok."
This morning we ate Chee Cheong Fun tasted stale & dried. We bought 4 pieces of other desserts and went home. Later we try to eat the deserts which already gone fouled & rotten!!! We threw away immediately. We believed the food's & desserts are left over from previous days! Never go back again!
Tai Du Bu Hao  Da Xiao Sheng
"Chye poh is fairly yummy. Unfortunately, opening hours on food delivery platforms are always incorrect. I've had riders arrive at a closed stall, resulting in my orders getting cancelled an hour after they're placed."
"The shui kueh tastes normal - nothing special. In my opinion, Bedok Chwee Kueh is better. Also, the price is not cheap at $3.50 for 5 pieces"
This stall the food was very nice but the service very bad specialy the gay man inside is rude and doesn't know how to handle costumer...
This is just the best breakfast I can think of. The taste is overwhelming.
"Chanced blogger post
so had takeaways
Great Chui kuehs
(Preserved turnip rice cakes steamed)
nice chilli in bo spill container

Stall sells Chong Pang Nasi too
wonderful authentic factory made
decent lemak, sweet chilli, crunchy bits & very fluffy eggs but no cucumber
Surprised 3 layers of wrap-paper-banana leaf
held package so well
not as lemak & spicy as epok epok central but comes close
good for quick tasty munch"
Yam cake and chweeh kueh texture was too mushy. Chee cheong fun was average.
Eat shui Kueh and cai po and whole day feel like vomitting..
"The secret of the Shui Kuey is in the Chye Poh (pickled vegetables), and Jian Bo has mastered it well, so explains the high price of $0.66 per Kuey and $1 for extra spoon of Chye Poh. It's delicious and I love it, so I occasionally indulge in such oily and sinful delicacy!"
"Not the same great taste I remember back I tiong bahru days. But the price increased so much, and portion of Chye Poh so little... I asked do add more - paid $1 for 1 spoon "
"The male staff taking my order was rude. Did not ask if I wanted to takeaway or dine in. So when he asked if I wanted a fork I was somewhat stumped cause I was expecting to eat at the hawker. I said no without thinking much, but quckily realize that I need one. I told him so, and he showily mumbled to himself. Firstly, he did not ask if I wanted to takeaway or dine in. Second, the whole process of asking if I need a fork took at most 5 secs. What was he irritated for?"
"Easily one of the best chee kweh's in Singapore. I have tried chee kweh's at a few places, but no one makes fluffy kweh's and chilli like Jian Bo Shui Kueh."
All time favorite. Alway buys this  whenever I visit Singapore.
"All time favourite kueh stall!! All kueh are freshly made and too satisfying for cravings. But there is a staff who is so rude and not really listening to our orders,in case if she has a disability but that's is not problem but she can't treat a customer she while using phone. Only unhappy with the customer customer service.Otherwise the food is great"
"I have been eating here for almost a decade already, and they never failed me. It is one of the better ones on the North side of SG. Chicken was tender, and the claypot rice was cooked just right to have the Guo Ba. Uncle was also quite friendly and helpful. Even helped me bring over the claypot when my hands were full."
Delicious claypot chicken rice
Good but a little too salty.
"Packed large portion. Can feed 4 of us. Chicken is boneless,  rice is so fragrant ... however,  don't quite like the lup cheong,  tasted more like taiwanese hotdogs."
"I have eaten at this claypot stall more than once and it never fails to satisfy me each time. The cooking has been consistent and all the flavours come together very well. The pieces of chicken are moist and the rice has a lovely char at the end.

This is a very tasteful and value-for-money serving of claypot rice that is cooked with care and dedication and cooked the proper way - from scratch. It does mean waiting a while for your order, but it is certainly worth the wait. This is one claypot rice I really enjoy."
"Prep time was <10mins, protein abundance and taste on point. It really is worth the effort to make the trip here"
"Super tasty food, good service, claypot chicken rice :)"
The claypot stall we will always go whenever we are craving for chicken claypot rice and Tian Ji. I must admit it may not be the best but it has the power to make us Si Nian. Can also make order thru the phone to save times.
Food was not bad but uncle was super rude.
I had claypot chicken rice here. Good cheap food with quick service.
Food look nice only
"A really simple claypot rice I'd say. Nothing fancy but everything tastes right.

Soft tender chicken, nicely marinated
Soft fluffy rice
Savoury and sweet Chinese sausages
Flavourful and smoky taste in every bite

Really affordable as well for the portion that they are serving. $11 for 2 pax. If you're a small eater you can go for the smaller option."
"This must be the best claypot rice in Woodlands! A hidden gem in this coffeeshop that houses Ipoh curry ccf that I introed previously. They specialise in claypot rice and claypot frog porridge.

We shared a $6 claypot chicken rice. It's sizzling hot with smoky aroma. So shiock! Wow, @$6 given alot of ingredients leh. Very tender boneless chicken, lup cheong and salted fish. Portion is generous, not so salty. Rice very fragrant. Just nice for us. We will be back for the claypot porridge!!

"
"Decent find! Minus one star because I felt the salted fish could be more fragrant and more. That said, will be back for it!"
"I highly recommend this stall to those whom like claypot rice.
Finally found one stall that serve nice claypot rice at Woodlands"
It's definitely the best claypot chicken rice in the north ...
"Dun need go JB anymore. If you are looking for delicious claypot rice that's equivalent to JB taste, say no more. Affordable price as well $6, way better than mall claypot rice.

These day it's hard to find authentic reviews. However prior to this post, google review had 90 plus review and avg at 5 star. I believed many of the reviews are like mine, out of the pure deliciousness of the food and not rig by promotions."
"For someone so picky, i honestly think this claypot chicken is good. Happy tummy "
"Jun'24 - ops... it has been a long time since last visit. The standard still very goood.

Sep'23 - Great Claypot Rice "
Suspended 2 weeks for failing to keep premises free of infestation.
"overheard a lot of ppl order from this stall, claypot chicken serving size is good, not too salty, not too sweet. will patronize again soon."
Very nice claypot frog porridge at reasonable price. Must try the claypot porridge that goes with the frog leg. Very flavourful. Friend tried the claypot rice says is nice too. Friendly boss.
The Claypole is authentic and delicious.  The meat are tender and the gravy is thick and flavourful. It was a satisfying dinner
"Food is deliciousssssss! Uncle friendly. But environment kinda noisy in this coffeeshop, people who visit this place will understand what I mean. Nothing wrong with the energy, just not my vibe. Once I finish eating, I just leave."
One of the best claypot rice. Very intense smoky flavour.
"Overrated claypot rice and frog leg. Claypot chicken rice taste was bad (bland), but the frog leg even worst. The Ah Pek there also sipek kns attitude. Not worth the trouble to even cross a road to eat it."
Nice claypot rice in a neighborhood coffee shop. Reasonably priced.
"I ordered a small one for trial. Wow, it is good! Rice is very glutinous, the crispy bottom is minimal but sufficient, chicken is very tender, can tell the control of fire power is top class. Salted fish amount is just nice, it Deserves to be top rated! For 6 dollars only."
Good place for frog porridge
Great foods at reasonable prices 
Highly recommended the claypot and going back. I truly enjoyed the food there and service is generally fast too. Try the western food if you are nearby there. The portion service is very big too and value for money.
"Pretty nice claypot rice!
Added $1 salted fish but couldn't really see them though..
Overall good as it tasted nice and waiting time is not too long."
1 of the better Claypot rice around in sg. Definitely a hidden gem
"Ordered the small claypot chicken rice at $6. Food was not too bad. No queue on a weekday, in fact whole coffeeshop was pretty empty. Found the black sauce on the sweeter side, while the rice is quite wet."
"Very good taste
Must try"
"Best claypot rice and frog i ever had. Rice was flavorful, every single grain well coated with sauce. Claypot frog sauce, spicy yet tasty. I can eat this for the rest of my life."
Sha Guo Fan 
"Fantastic claypot rice and frog leg porridge. The claypot rice is perfectly flavoured - neither too sweet nor salty and the frog leg dish has chunky meat in well-seasoned dark sauce.

The portions used to be significantly more generous - but I'm not complaining as the quality has not changed. HDB parking is available behind this food court."
$11 for 2 pax portion and I would say portion is generous. There is a nice fragrance to the rice and chicken meat is tender. Good.
"Claypot rice is delicious, but if u eat this for lunch at work, prepare for a pretty potent food coma."
"Their claypot rice is worth a try. Their frog Leg Chilli Claypot is probably the best they have, out of all the dishes that they offer, but it's also the most expensive."
"Breezy friendly atmosphere, claypot stuffs are good, quantities are more than ample and delicious
"
"Claypot chicken rice and gongbao frog with my homemade balacan, shiok sia"
"Normal coffeeshop standard claypot rice. Too wet for my liking, and the burnt rice didn't taste nice."
"One of the best claypot rice in the North! Tried the chicken claypot rice and at $5.50 for 1pax serving was hugeeeeee. Generous amount of topping! Not too salty and bonus charred rice at the bottom was delicious! Great for big eaters! Highly recommed and will revisit to try the other claypot dishes.

Came again to try the Claypot Spring Onion Frog Leg. Taste average. The claypot rice still the most delish!"
"Wow! This place serves the one of the most tasty claypot rice that I have ever eaten. There is a very aromatic charred flavor that permeates every grain of the rice.

The chicken is tender and well marinated. Sprinkled with pieces of lap cheong and just the right amount of salted fish, this is a wonderful pot of claypot rice. The dark sauce used is also very tasty and not just salty.

Didn't manage to take the photo of the pot - dig in too fast. "
"Damn, this is definitely worth mentioning, I would say this is among the top clay pot chicken but I must say it's not too far behind. For $6, the portion is good and full of ingredients, the rice is cook just right, chicken is juicy and tender, while clay pot is full of flavours. I definitely did not regret trying, will come back again if I'm nearby. Highly recommended."
Quite decent claypot chicken rice but their kung pao frog's legs were average at best.
"Decent claypot chicken rice, but there was verryyyy little salted fish - husband and I shared the rice, and I did not get a single piece of salted fish. So, the flavour was lacking.

The rice is also a little on the wet side, not yet mushy but getting there.

The chilli is also lacking - no sambal or prepared chilli, it's just chilli padi with soy sauce.

Uncle is very friendly however."
Not that great la. Can fill your tummy but tongue not that happy. Prefer if they have liver lap cheong or more salted fish.
First time trying. Worth it. A stall at a simple coffeeshop with decent crowd. Tried on a weekday dinner. Waited about 15 mins for my food. Portion is decent. 1 pax portion is sgd5.50. 3 pax portion for sgd14. Overall taste good but the rice seem abit wet. Always a good choice for dinner.
"Claypot rice damn good. Take note Google address is wrong, should be at block 111"
One of the better clayport rice I have tried. Portion is pretty big.
"Affordable, good tasting porridge and claypot frog! A must come for people staying around the neighbourhood."
I love the Claypot Century Egg Poridge there.

Claypot Chicken Rice is GOOD!!!!!!~~~~
Nice claypot rice for a comfort meal. One of the most under rated one.
"Jin Le Woodlands Claypot Rice is a hidden gem! I've been living in the North for 10+ years and have only tried their Chicken Claypot Rice yesterday. The Chicken Claypot Rice was prepared with generous portion of rice, chicken meat and lap cheong (the Cantonese name for Chinese sausage). It came with your black soya sauce and flavoured oil already in the rice - so there is no need for you to DIY. The overall taste is super-shiok! Very fragrant, crispy (well charred) and umami! There is a waiting time of 15-20 mins during non-peak hours. Pricing is very reasonable - $5 / $9 / $13. My order is the $5 portion. Highly highly recommended!"
Jin Le Claypot in a small coffeeshop serves claypot rice and porridge. Everything looked good ... finally went for the standard claypot chicken rice. This bowl for $9 can easily feed 3 people! Watch the video to see how piping hot it was. Super fragrant and extremely yummy. Lots of ingredients too! They are generous with the chicken and lup cheong. But you know what's my favourite part? The burnt bits. There were a lot of burnt bits at the side!
Good claypot rice .
Excellent comfort food
"Generous servings of meat in the claypot rice, at a reasonable price. The frog leg is not bad too, just that it's too expensive compared to other places."
"Nice and tasty Jiang Cong Tian Ji, not first time eat this."
Very nice food can be found herr6
"There are better, but this shine at North.
For the porridge is also my recent to go food. Nice frog!"
"A normal bowl of clay pot rice, nothing fantastic."
"Found this place for my wife and according to her, the claypot chicken rice is very very good."
"Excellent claypot rice! Tasty, nice crust. Pleasant service:)"
Liao Duo. Lao Ban Ye Hen You Shan. 
"Friendly Uncle. Reasonable price. Claypot rice is a bit wet. Nice place for couple meals, not ideal for big groups."
Orders taken and waiting time about 15 minutes for claypot chicken rice. Uncle is slow and steady in serving the food.
Uncle good service
Delicious! Forg leg claypot in Woodlands 10 min walk Blk 111 or take bus 913 at B6 1 stop. Clean tidy friendly fast service. See photos for varieties.
"New food court at parkway, ordered medium portion of chicken pot with some add on like vege and black fungus...overall taste is ok, quite generous with chicken cube...but taste lacking something until I put in some vinegar and tasted better.

Got 1 person portion which I will try if I am alone next time."
24-25/7/25 Thursday and Friday not open according to the boss
"The best wanton noodles in my opinion! My parents followed them from the boss ang moh (Joo Chiat), 1985 to the current address now! My first impression was at the old address (Tembeling road), always long queue but so worth it. The only stall I would queue for. "
"Another popular wanton mee stall at this hawker centre, waiting time around 30 minutes. Noodles are cooked al dente, love their crispy fried wantons. Ho Jiak!!!"
"Worse wanton meet i eaten, noodle is hard, soup and wanton has a very strong fishy taste and smell. Never coming back again."
"A very competent plate of $4 wanton mee with wanton, char siew, vege, al dente noodles coated in a delectable sauce"
"My favourite wanton noodles spot in Singapore (taste is subjective). Some would prefer the Eng's wanton noodles upstairs (which I've tried too, but not really a fan).

I always go for the dry ""white"" version (no dark soy sauce) and adjust the chili to my liking.

My must-add: their fried wantons. Super crispy and great if you're not into the meatier versions that sometimes come with that porky smell.

They usually close by 2pm or earlier if sold out, so best to go early."
"have u forgotten that u are providing a service?

your high ego + arrogance = a disgrace to Dunman FC

noodles are mediocre, wantons are pathetically bland

oh yeah, your attitude sucks too

stay humble, this is Singapore"
"Not consistent, sometime very salty , some time very oily , the noodle is undercooked, the China lady boss is very rude , overrated, don't understand why so many people Q for it , maybe singaporean love to Q , not because the food is nice, because they love to Q ,"
"Have been eating at this stall since they were at Tembeling Road.
Used to be known as Ang Mo..but notnsure why it is called Ah Huat now sinced they reopen at Dunman Hawker Center.
Same owner.."
Good plate of noodles.
The noodles are chewy and worth a try if you around the area. Long q tho.
"They served good wanton noodles with char siew, but I'm not a fan of char siew, so I got more wantons instead! "
"I loved the wanton mee (esp mee pok)  but is always sold out if you come late morning towards afternoon... the noodle is different, very q. Been 20+ years.."
"Noodle is salty , soggy with strong lye water after taste. Wantan so-so , don't understand the long queue

Mian You Hen Chong De Jian Shui Wei ,You Xian .  Mian Kou Gan Ruan Ruan De ,Yun Tun Hen Pu Tong ,Bu Ming Bai Wei Shi Me Yi Dui Ren Zai Pai Dui "
"Patronised Joo Chiat Ah Huat on this Thu as my preferred Dunman Charsiew on the upper level of the food centre was closed.

$4 portion was good-size, service non-fuss and fast, soup wanton on-point, but noodles was a tad salty for me.  As always, highlight was the fried wanton ($4 for 8pcs), dipped in mayo sauce, and this combination pushed it to 4 overall for me."
"The wanton mee is not consistent, we ordered 3 plates all with different noodle textures, some noodles were too hard like it was just cooked for 3mins while some was just barely soft. The attitude of the owner especially the lady owner talked bad about how we didnt use manderine to converse and order, to me its a sign you dont receive well for feedbacks. Doesnt really matter if we cant converse using manderine we can always speak in english, i dont understand the bad attitude towards tourists. Honestly if i were you wanting to try it give a try just order a plate and you would know what i am talking about. Who knows maybe you are lucky enough to get a noodle that is well done. The only thing nice is their wanton as it should be as it is mention in their store name. It doesnt taste too floury (if this is a word) like other stores and the meat inside is tender."
"If you like your noodles lardy and dry, not watered down by soup even though it's supposed to be ""dry"", this is the right place for you."
"One of the better wanton noodles I have tried so far. It was love at first bite ! Springy egg noodles coated with savoury sauce and chilli, the pork lard just takes the dish to a whole new level. Expect a queue if you are there 7.30ish with the office crowd"
"This is our go-to for wanton mee; we like the noodle texture and the sauce, and the fried wantons are nice and crispy. But minus two stars for rude service. We live in this neighbourhood and have been patronising this stall for many years so the stall holders recognise my husband and even then once when he ordered ""large"" and failed to say he wants ""add more ingredients"" (rather than ""add noodles"") the old lady scolded him ceaselessly. She is this way all the time; if you place your order with no issue you'll receive her usual sullen service but if you are unclear in your order be prepared to face her wrath !!"
"Ah Huat! He used to work at Ang Moh. Better and prices are more reasonable than Ang Moh these days. Line might get a little long and therefore longer wait times but honestly, one of the best wonton mee out there. I think he might be using the same supplier for the noodles as Ang Moh. For me (to each their own), those noodles are just wonderful."
"The Wanton Mee is very traditional, perhaps too traditional for my taste. The noodles were thicker than usual, which I wasn't used to. However, the wantons in the soup were nice. At $4, it's good value for money."
taste good and cheap. Location is nearby MRT Station.
"Localised wanton noodle. This wanton noodle stall serves the basics well. Noodles are cooked just right, with a light, savoury broth, and decently filled dumplings. Nothing fancy, but it's a go-to for locals craving a simple, satisfying meal that hits familiar flavours every time."
"The noodles at Joo Chiat Ah Huat Wanton Noodle are springy and firm, with a slight chew that absorbs the savory sauce well. The sauce is a balanced mix of soy, oil, and sometimes a hint of lard, giving it a rich umami flavor. Paired with tender char siew and crispy fried wantons, the dish has a satisfying blend of sweet, salty, and smoky notes. The overall taste is classic and comforting, with a nostalgic, old-school charm."
"Service is a little slow as they are a very old couple, this line is tough and I respect that.
Anyways, the wanton mee is pretty damn good. Unique in it's own way, it's more to for those who eat ramen, like a shio style. So it's more of a salt base, but it's fragrant cause they use fried shallots with some of its oil so it's quite nice. Noodle has a nice bite to it. Wanton skin is very nice too, doesn't break apart so easily and with a good bite to it, everything hand made. I swear, THIS SHOP IS A GEM, ingredients are lacking slightly but it's still pretty affordable for me.
Spice has a good little kick to it, so for those who can't take spice, no spice please.
This is a very objective review.
Overall a pretty damn good shop."
"14/9/24
Had wanton noodles ($4) & braised chicken feet ($4) for lunch, was good. Noodles was cooked al denta."
"The noodles came in a generous portion, but the taste was ordinary despite the good reviews. They were quite fragrant and a bit oily. The wonton soup was cloudy, likely due to the boiling of the wontons."
"*Warning* Sodium Overload!!

As a Hokkien who has ""heavy"" taste, even I cannot take the saltiness from the wanton mee.  And the sodium is not even from the chilli, as the chilli is the normal chilli paste that u can find anywhere. Not the Dunman wanton mee fiery type of chilli. Hence only added a bit.

If you expect the famous dunman road wanton mee like Eng's, advise you to go upstairs. That is almost similar to it and the chilli is the same as the legendary one.

If you want to overwork your kidneys, then try this store.

Definitely a no-no for me...the long queue is due to slow and inefficient service and most probably people that cannot handle spiciness.

Duck rice on the opposite side looks good though...many patrons...will be my next try."
One of my fav wtm place. The braised chicken feet is a must order dish!
Best wanton mee. Eating it for forty years. Deserves nothing less than five stars. The price has not even increase that much over the years.
"A decent wanton mee. Not bad but not great. The noodles were yummy, other ingredients seem cheap quality. The wanton soup smells, not very appetizing. Service is great."
"Loved their wanton, soup and savoury chicken feets to the max. Chilli sauce used to be good, once became very sour and less spicy then now less sour spiciness acceptable. The only thing is, the tough and starchy mee kia. Ah Huat seems stubborn on it despite feedbacked as a regular which he acknowledged. This is just chilli noodle, not authentic wanton mee. But their wanton, sides and chilli sauce are main attraction and appetising than the mee kia, which i find kinda pity. Anyway, authentic actual wanton mee are long gone in this era."
Average wanton mee with no redeeming qualities.
"I recall eating this quite some time ago and it did not quite leave a deep impression. But this time round, I find it really good. I especially like the noodle for its texture that is firm and chewy. I also find the wanton better than most other places - soft and delicate skin and delicious fillings. Worth to have a go at this wanton noodle stall if you are here."
"Hmm not quite what what we expected. Noodle was too starchy, probably not rinsed enough after cooking. Sauce is salty & tasty. A little too oily. Only 3 boiled wanton in soup."
"Chao Ai Zhe Li De Ji Jiao,Mei Ci Du Yao Lai Yi Pan "
"After year must review again - esp as Eng's has opened near by. Still a much superior product

Mee- QQ nice and springy no lye taste not floury (properly washed after first cook

Wanton - the soup wanton are fat and juicy the fried are different as the filling is smeared over the wanton case- so it doesn't end up like a bullet plus the wrapper is properly tied so is brown and super crispy

Soup - delicious porky flavour

Char Siew- ok they buy in. Is ok

Phoenix claw (aka chicken feet) braised for a long time in 5 spice soy

Reopened after renovation. Prices up 50c still same high quality especially the support acts- Phoenix claw, fried wanton, wanton plate"
"The stall lady is having a big time attitude. Told her i wan chilli, she heard as i dont wan chilli . Then when i took 1 more extra mayonise sauce. She reply why i took so many. Just total in 2 sauces and she start shouting. Crazy Lady. Try ur luck when she not in mood."
My favourite Wantan Mee at the East Of Singapore. At Huat use to work for Ang Mo Wantan Mee for his sister but she had sold her stall . Ah Huat Open 6 months later and I had been eating as it taste exactly like Ang Mo Wanton mee!  The scallion oil mix w fresh Pork Lard w own noodle ! Wow!  Perfect noodle for a wonderful Sunday 
Come for bf. Order the $6 with extra ingredients which doesn't seem like a lot. But yes taste is great especially the noodles.
Wanton Noodle
"Here, the wanton noodles are delicious. They use their own homemade noodles, which are very tasty. I added extra noodles for a total of SGD 6, but it's worth it because I ordered a large portion. The ambiance is comfortable for dining as well."
The noodles were lumpy and overcooked and didn't taste good. The soup also tasted strange. But the char siew and the wanton did save the food somewhat. Had eaten better ones elsewhere - not worth the queue.
"Char Siew is good.
Taste a bit sour but overall still okay.
Chilli not spicy enough and salty."
"I arrived at 11:39 AM to queue and gotten my food by 12:05 PM. After collecting my food, I left and noticed a queue had formed. The $4 portion size is perfect for one person, the noodles have a delightful chewiness, and the chili combines sour and sweet flavors. The filling in the soup wantons is also delicious. What I particularly enjoy is that Dunman hawker isn't overly crowded!"
"Used to be super good when his sister operated under Ang-Mo which was sold.

Then we follow him to Dunman. By and by the standard drops a lot. We gave feedback quietly in person a few times but they do not seem to bother and make excuses, especially the wife .

Last week was the ultimate. The soup which was the reason i patronise so far has gone out of the window.

Raise price and cut corners, like almost everyone else.

Sad."
"Simple plate of wanton noodles, some pieces of char siew, few bits of cut greens, and a small bowl of wanton soup. Noodles al dente not soggy, no sauce, can be a little dry. Fried wanton simple and crispy, not too oily, not much flavouring. Cash or PayNow acceptable."
"I have been a fan of Ah Huat ever since they were the original 'Ang Mo Wanton Mee' at Tembeling.  This is a saltier rendition of wanton mee with fried onion oil and light shrimp paste for umami.  Noodles quality changed over the years as it had less alkali taste in the past.  Lines are usually quite long here (at least 4 to 20 ppl ahead), so prepare to come slightly earlier before meal peak hours.  Nice char siew flavor, which has been cut thinner in recent years, but still succulent.  They still give about 8-10 slices (can't see in my pic as I'd already tossed the noodles before shooting the photo).  Wantons are plump and light (4 in total), put in a generous bowl of umami flavored soup.  You can also order fried wantons as an add-on.  Toss fast, eat quick, best to eat dine-in as takeaway for too long makes noodles soggy."
"My favourite wanton mee. Better than the one upstairs. Fried wanton are fried to order. Comes with a bowl of 3 wantons in soup too.

However, this is the egg-y kind of wanton mee, strong egg flavour in the noodles."
"The wanton mee is actually average, and the Char Siew is dry. Soup is also bland."
"$4 for a play or wanton noodle is reasonable, though adding a portion of noodle is not ($2 more). Green chilli is crunchy with mix of sweet and sour taste.

The stall serves a bigger bowl of soup, which is sufficient compared to other stalls that give a much smaller bowl."
"not the more typical wanton mee, that is either cantonese or malaysia. but it taste good. noodle tend to be on the dry side. on of my favorite."
"Craving for springy & chewy wanton noodles? Head over to Dunman Food Centre. Starting $4 per bowl, topped with few slices of char siew, vegetables & 3 wanton in soup. Uniqueness lies in its noodles which is more springy than others. Chilli sauce lack of umami sweetness, while the char siew and wanton is average. Soup is actual quite good.
Expect queue during meal time. Very limited parking at open carpark in front of the food centre, more parking across next to the police station."
"It deserves 5 stars for quality of wanton, springy noodles and excellent soup. Only drawback is the charsiew where it could be meatier, fattier and juicier."
"This is a lazy post. I was here for the wtm and tamjiak so went for the tau pok stall and by the way did a quick review... ;)

This is the sort of wtm that seems to be quite the 'in' thing in this part of katong (fei fei, ang mo, etc.) ... the type of noodle that's thicker.

Overall, I like this sort of noodles. This wtm stall is recommended becos serving is decent, price is affordable, tucked at basement of Dunman food centre, it only opens at most til lunch.

Noodle is not soft, soup is good, wanton not too small, sauce mixture is good balanced, char siew not too lean or grainy... yah, the good of day wan ton mee la. Treasure them!"
It's ok wantan Mee. A bit too oily for my liking. Aunty also damn fierce. $4 is cheap
"i went to give it a try on this wanton noodles because of the gd review in google. However, I am very disappointed with this wanton noodle for the price of $4. i ordered wanton noodle with chilli but the noodle coated with the chilli turns out salty. The char siew and wanton is ok only. Not worth queuing for this wanton mee."
Decent wanton noodle. Bought it because there are queues and thought it must be very good
"This is my go-to wanton noodles place in SG!  Have been eating here for as long as I could remember, years before they rebranded and moved to Dunman Food Centre. Noodles, wantons, chilli, soup has always been consistent and delicious. Highly recommend!!"
Best for morning breakfast!
Waton Tan Mee is up to standard.
The noodle is still good as before but price has gone up.
"I had Wanton Noodle and Wanton Soup. The noodle is pretty decent, similar to hakka mee. The Wantons are not bad too."
"Sporting a long queue in the morning, I was drawn to it since my go to isn't opened yet.

 This isn't exactly the kind that catches on quickly, but the chilli does add to the flavour later in the meal (like only after you are halfway through) and makes the meal a little better overall.

 but for the price point of $3.50 for the small bowl, there's not too much to complain given the portion

Though it may not be to everyone's liking, it really only caught on for me right before the meal ends "
Wonton noodle ($5.50 with added ingredients) -  A little above average. The noodles had good texture though a little salty. The wontons and char siew was average. The queue moved slowly.
"This is one of my facourite Wanton Noodle.  Nicely done and the sauce, but today the chilli was a bit too salty. Fried wanton is good too. They are sold out around 1.30pm, so go early."
"Tastes flat wait too long
Nit worth it"
Love the wanton noodle n also the chicken feet. My go to place when I need comfort food
"Their braised chicken feet is so irresistible. One you've eaten it, u can't help but keep coming back every weekend just to eat it. The kopi is awesome"
"Noodle texture is great. However, the chilli probably is too salty and made the whole plate of the wanton noodle too salty.
Wonton is good though."
"Apparently it tastes better when dining in. The noodle was a little too dry and salty (perhaps due to the extra chilli).

Reminded me of the Tanjong Rhu wanton mee.

In my opinion, there's better wanton mee out there, e.g. Hong Ji Mian Shi Jia."
"I dunno if its wanton mee that im eating anot. Chilli taste off, noodle oily and stink of plastic smell. Wanton too salty. Omg."
"Normal decent wanton noodles done well  and al dente, but this kind of eggy noodle texture is not my fav. Char siew is the thinly sliced school canteen kind. Wanton is ok. The chicken feet taste good though. Chilli sauce also quite nice. This is my 2nd visit to confirm I'm not a fan. Not worth the queue."
This is the most salty and oily wanton noodles I have ever eaten!
Go buy food like a beggar.  The owner and his wife are uneducated and unpolite.  Customer contact is not good.  bad food not good.  don't visit again
Surprised at the queue. Tried it but felt like a peppery and salty version of wanton mee. Would not return.
"Nice, sour and tangy chilli sauce with firm wanton noodles.  The price is affordable and the chilli goes well with the wontons."
"Pretty avg decent wanton mee you can find in hawker centers. Noodles are springy, sauce is a bit plain.. the wantons here is the winner."
Extremely salty for the sambal chilli and noodles. Ate at noon but thirsty till midnight and price is same as marine parade FEI FEI wantan noodle. Rather eat at FEI FEI  lcos nicer
Best wanton noodle..
"Traditionally taste with the gor zhar experience. $3.50 per bowl of Yun Tun Mian,can add noodles but will need to top up $. Also sell chicken feet noodles but yet to try."
Very tasty and value for money
"The chilli sauce makes this a winner. You gotta try then you will understand. It goes so well with the noodle. Wanton and chicken feet is nice also. A bit less oily in the sauce would be perfect. Came early on a sat morning, no need to queue "
Simple tasty wanton mee. Good noodles. Char siew is lean but tender.
"Tried for the 1st and last time.
Ordered the dry version. Very oily, chilli has no flavour, no punch.
The wontons were just bits of minced meat, not firmed solid
type. Only consolation was the
Noodles were Al dente."
"Wanton Noodle + Braised Chicken Feet. The stall owner used to as Ang Moh wanton noodle which boast a huge fan base until it was sold. Now returning as Ah Huat Wanton Noodles, the loyal fans have returned as well. I like their springy noodles and wanton soup though I can't attest to their char siew which is essentially just red dye meat.  The chicken feet is a good add on for those who have acquired the taste."
I saw a queue for this and tried. Its..... average.. nothing specially different.
BEST wanton mee to me and all in my family! I have been eating for years all the way from previous location at Tembeling Road to now Dunman food centre! My order is always the same called San Duo which means add chilli; wanton and soup! yummy!
"A stall that bewildered me... forever long queue but WTM tasted average. Not sure what's the attraction here. WTM overly salty, too rich."
"Long queue at this stall and so it must be good. Waited for about half an hour for the food and was slightly disappointed.

The noodles were ok. It was a little soggy and didn't quite like the chilli sauce. What makes up for it would the soup. It has a nice ikan bilis taste and the wanton wasn't too bad either."
Soup is nice. W ikan bills smell. Noodle too dry. Wanton is good. Q for half hour
Grumpy and arrogant order taker
"Used to be so much better now it's really bad, portion is small, noodles were mushy, tiny pieces of char siew, wonton had little filling and worst the overall taste salty and oily, it's like eating a plate of noodles soaked in two day old grease. The China lady uses her bare hands to pick food up, rather unhygienic I feel, Don't waste your time coming here, you can easily get a much better bowl of wonton noodles at any food court."
Biased as I grew up with this wanton noodles. The nostalgia feeling begins the metallic slams of the cover that the Uncle and Aunty cooking and serving the soup. I love the tangy vinegary chilli. Although it's a little salty now. The chicken feet is well stewed and really falls off the bone. The fried wanton is prepared freshly upon order. Definitely a east siders gastronomical stop over.
"Old school springy wanton noodle located in Dunman Food Centre, Unit #01-04. Open from 7am - 3pm.

Verdict: 
OK only but not worth the queue. Too salty for me and..........."
Open from 7am to 3pm. Manned by an uncle and ah ma. Ordered their noodle with chilli and fried wan ton. The soup serving is big compared to other store. Noodle is quite normal as so not have the tangy bite. My son order without chilli and was given dark sauce which look more appetizing. Best dish is the fries wan ton which is crispy. No long queue after lunch hour
"Noodles a nice texture, but extremely salty. Dumplings have an overtly strong porky smell and taste."
I find it a bit salty especially with the chilli sauce.
"One of the better wanton mee around Joo Chiat/Dunman area. At normal times, there would always be a queue. Now the queue is shorter during the pandemic.

The char siew and the noodles are ok. Nothing to shout about. The special ingredients that make the noodle stand out is their chilli paste and stock base. There is a burst of flavours from the chilli paste, good enough to bring me back time and again. The wanton is a generous portion, with mainly lean minced meat fillings, come in 3 PCs with a fantastic soup!

Overall a satisfying wanton noodles, unless you're going for gourmet char siew."
Queue for 40mins. Noodles salty and tasteless. The wantan soup is tasteless and the wantan has got a very strong pork smell. The chicken feet not tender enough. Did not finish all the dishes. Too disappointed till forgot to take photo. :) anyway is our own preference. Some patrons has good comment on it. :)
"Pretty decent.  With a tinch of spiced up
Chilli.  Noodles well stirred up with wonton skin up with tasty minced meat.
Be prepared for a Q.
Carry on makan."
"delicious wanton, succulent dumplings and noodles are very al dente and on the savory side, with the chilli packing a punch. The chicken feet could be a little softer though it could be because i've gotten a fresh batch. This is a matter of preference - some likes wtm sweeter, some more savory.."
"A little too oily and jelat for my preference. The wanton, char siew were average not too sure what's the hype. The noodles texture is good though but will be a lot better if it's less oily."
"Next to Fried Hokkien Mee, Chai Tow Kway and Chicken Rice, I reckon #WantonMee is one of the most subjective of hawker dishes out there. Everyone has a favourite stall they swear by, and are more than happy to list the evidence as to why it is so whenever the topic is tabled. Of course, there are no right and wrong answers because at the end of the day, our tastebuds simply gravitate towards the version we find most pleasing .
Topping my own list of go-to's when the craving hits is #JooChiatAhHuatWantonNoodle which is located in the basement of Dunman Road Food Centre. For those of you who've followed me on Instagram for a while, you've likely seen me share about it quite often on my Stories. Anyway, I've been a regular customer since they started because I had recognised the owner - he use to work side-by-side with the original ladyboss (I'm guessing they are related) of Hong Mao Wanton Mee when they were at Tembeling Road (I was such a huge fan!) before she retired and sold the business to a couple of her regular customers.
For me, Joo Chiat Ah Huat's wanton mee tastes the same as Hong Mao's. From the al dente noodles to the sauce (which is a bit darker than most) to the unique tangy chilli sambal, it's a combination I enjoy immensely. While their lean slices of char siew are acceptable, their handmade wantons are scene-stealing with tastily-seasoned fillings and very smooth, soft skin. Our modus operandi is to add on an order of their wanton soup to share, so we can feast on more of those silky parcels. A plate of this stall's braised chicken feet is another must for us because they do an extremely tasty rendition that includes frying the chicken feet before braising them in an aromatic sauce concocted from sesame oil, black soya sauce and ginger.
If you plan on trying the food from here, my advice is to arrive early, like in the morning or before 1pm to be very safe. And be prepared to queue."
"The wanton mee is not nice.

It's oily and the noodles taste not nice. It's has a very strong Geng (alkaline) taste that overpowers everything

The chilli also doesn't taste nice w the dish.

The wanton is alright but otherwise I really don't recommend trying.

Not sure why there's slight queue on wkday lunch although they are quite slow"
Seems the lady no longer there as her cooking is 100% perfect years ago
my favourite wanton Mee.
Best Wanton Noodle in SG. Period. 
"Joo Chiat Ah Huat wanton mee - if you love fragrant homemade chilli, you will love this place. But if you love fiery chilli stick to engs. I love how they are so generous with fried scallions, char siew is lean and flavourful. Wanton nothing fantastic. Also, from this I conclude that the east has so many nice wanton mee."
Expect a long queue during lunch time even though the cook works very quickly without stopping. Try the fried wanton.
The food was good
Not too bad but a little salty for my liking
"The noodles texture is just nice, not over-cooked. Soup and wanton quite close to the old school taste. Abit disappointed with the chilli, many people may like the chilli. But, personally feel that the chilli taste abit sour for me. Wont recommend to put too much. Overall still worth eating."
Nice wantons. Other than that their taste is unique. Not typical type of wanton mee. Like it or don't like it. For me. No.
Unique taste of its own. Not the typical or old school wanton mee kind but ok to try. Their chicken feet is pretty nice though. Order some to try if u like chicken feet. Overall rating 55/100
"They removed the Q numbering system, and customers now need to stand in Q for more than 30min. This is a service downgrade and step backward from push for smart nation.  Plsss bring back the Q numbering system.
2 other famous wanton mee in the East definitely provide better service and nice wonton mee"
Good old school wanton noodle from the former operator of Ang Mo Noodle House at Tembeling Road.
Third of 3 wanton mee noodle stalls review I did around Joo Chiat. A tad too oily for my liking. Not much character to the flavouring of the noodles. Wanton was quite good though.
"I've ordered a plate of $5 wanton mee with extra spicy, it wasn't up to my expectation.
There is a funny sour taste in the chilli, maybe because I didn't mix the chilli well enough.
The noodle has a strong alkaline taste which I don't like.
The char siew and wanton are good.

There are better wanton noodles out there and this is not quite there yet."
Best wanton for me in Joo Chiat/Katong hands down. It is scallion based noodles which is hard to find. I tested about 8 wanton noodles in this area.
Closed when Google Maps says its open. What a disappointment. I travelled all the way from Woodlands and this shop does not have any courtesy to update their operational timing.
A satisfying plate of wonton noodles paired with a side of braised chicken feet.
Nice original wonton noodles.
I'm always happy to eat here .. won ton is freshly cooked and also fresh ingredients used
One of my favourite wanton mee! Soup is flavourful with natural seasoning.  Chilli sauce is very special and a must try!
Today wanton abit salty but nice sauce to mix with Noodle
Nice wanton noodle. Noodle is cooked to the right hardness and the sauce nicely coats the noodles. Some may find the sauce a bit too salty but I find it quite aromatic with pieces of pork lard and shallot oil. Wanton is of decent size and quality. Soup is also light and delicious.
One of the best wanton mee & also must try their fried wanton.. very delicious!
Must try the chili paste
There's still a long queue in the morning at 8am. The taste is still good but the noodles are way undercooked. So it may not be worth it because of the long queue and difficult parking.
Very nice wanton mee. A bit oily though.
Eat since small
Wait too long for your meal
"The wanton noodles are springy . do beware chilli paste is hot for children . but sauce is abit on the salty . they dont serve tomato sauce type . their wanton is succulent , regular size which is bigger then some stalls . fried wanton are offered as sides ."
It used to be so popular and we couldn't get enough of the stuff. Then lately it has become far too salty you can feel the hyper tension coming on strong! Didn't bother to take photos. Hope the guy reduces his salt
"There's no crowd but still have to wait for 15 to 20 mins... Simply arrogant. Don't know why so because the noodles is just very normal as compared to other wanton noodles stores. In fact there's no re better ones out there, e.g the one at meiling street market."
"OK lah, it's getting very salty. At least the noodles dun stick together and ""niam niam"""
"Limited parking lots, though love the food available!"
"Among better tasting wanton noodles around, surprised there was noy queue today"
Taste good.
Chewy noodle...
Even long waiting time but it worth of waiting for good n nice foods
Not as good anymore
Nice noodle. Just a bit of queue here.
"One of the best wanton noodle I had,"
"This is an old school, feels good kind of wanton mee. Nothing fancy but always comforts the tummy. Whenever I'm overseas, I'll crave for it. The rich ikan bilis taste in the soup makes me come back for more. If you are a fan of stewed chicken feet, you'll love their version. The fried wanton is awesome too."
"In case people wondered, but this particular stall is the original Hong Mao Wanton Mee near Tembeling Road, right across Haig Girls School.

There used to be a mid to old age lady that helms the stall, but due to ill health, she no longer does that and the stall has been passed on to a long-time apprentice who helped out at the old stall.

This used to be my go-to wanton noodle in Singapore, however standards have since fallen. It is quite unfortunate. While it is still a more than decent wanton noodle (hence the 3 star rating), it has fallen from its very lofty standards from the past."
"Only steps, no slope or wheelchair access."
Good wanton noodles for breakfast!
Expensive compared to the wanton stall upstairs
Mei Yi Qian(Hong Mao Mian)Shi De Hao Wei. 
"Not fabulous, but texture of the noodles was not soggy nor too soft. Char siew didn't make the mark thou. Chilli can be rather spicy "
World best wtm
"Not sure why there is a Q system here and heard that it is usually long Q. But this morning when I was here, there is hardly anyone around. Had the wanton noodle, the wanton comes in a separate bowl and it is quite good and tasty. Don't really like the noodle as there is no taste of noodle and texture. Most likely to not eat here again."
Store owners especially the woman has some anger issues.
"Quite forgettable 'cos as I am writing this review I forgot how it taste. There is nothing special on the noodles, char siew and chicken legs. Wantons' size more decent than many other wanton stalls that I have been to. In particular l, they are generous with the meat fillings in he wanton."
One of my fav wanton mee. However consistency is not there. They were the previous owners of the hong mao wanton mee located at Joo chiat. Have been their followers since then.
"Had to wait around 20mins for my turn during weekend lunch hour. It was my first time trying this and the wanton mee was just alright. The wantons were big but lacked flavour, the noodles were nicely springy and the sauce was too oily for my liking."
Noodles texture is good but overall taste is nothing to shout about
Very good like his fathers time the ang moh wan tan mee .
Old school wanton Mee fix
"Unique system, take a queue number. Wait for turn. Go and give order. Take your choice of noodle when done, go find a place to eat. Taste OK, price average."
"Located at #01-04. 2 stalls into 1, you can't miss it. Uses queue number system. Place your orders & wait for your number to be called. Noodle is ok, Q enough, but just lacked that oomph I was expecting. Something in the taste dept was missing, but it's still above average to be fair. But the wantons were smooth & quite good though. Enjoyed them. For $3 & the portion given, it's worth a try."
Abang Fried rice here was quite scrumptious. A bit hard to find seats during peak hours but it's a very well ventilated and clean hawker center.
Nice and clean 
"Getting better and better. Lot of foods and choices.
Has wet market, NTUC Prime supermarket to coffee beans, KFC ,Mac and Starbucks etc.. Just like a min shopping mall."
"been here so many times... been to Yassin & the food court on 2nd floor couple of times.

lots of food options. guess the prices are competitive similar to other eateries.

Plenty of parking at basement with NTUC fairprice for groceries."
Many shops even have medical facilities
"Guys you have to come here to eat, the food here is delicious"
Many good food options
I always will go to the kampung admiralty level 2 to eat lunch with my parents and sometimes we have time then we eat together we also eat finish and we try some of the dish and there also a new place called the Admiralty Place there is some new shopping centre there to buy there also have bubble tea drink like I tea and Coffee and beans there also have shoe shop to buy if your shoe is old you can buy from Admiralty Place so faster and come to the Admiralty Place.
No prayer room for Muslim..
"OMG, you guys HAVE to try the nasi lemak here!  It's seriously so cheap and affordable - like, everyone's favourite kind of deal!  This place is a gem for yummy and budget-friendly food. Plus, it's right by the senior HDB, which gives it such a sweet, community vibe for all the Admiralty residents.  Honestly, I just love it here! 

I love the planning architect, engineer as well as subcontractor and management here who did this the planning architect, engineer, subcontractors, and management all deserve a big shout-out for creating such a lovely environment for the Admiralty residents! "
"Very airy, well organised meeting, eating, activities place for mates and family members to gather and yet not rowdy enclosures.
worth spending your time here"
"Gives new meaning to what a neighborhood mall should be.  Good  mix of retail and shopping.  Layout was new, refreshing and airy.

What I liked most was how the medical clinics & services are incorporated into this mall."
Convenient place for shopping and eating out.
Good mix of food and shops. Fairprice is open 24hrs.
"No enforcement at driveway for alighting. Allowing errant drivers to leave cars there unattended. Deprive people who needs to alight, especially on a rainy day!"
Diversity of local street foods here
"Heard that their Laksa was good. Today try cuz most of the time long que. My opinion, no hum. Gravy taste is there. Got 1 pc of ngor hiang, half hard Boil egg, half prawn & 2 thin slices of fish cake. Bean sprouts a bit sad. $4.50 a bowl. Small. Not worth. Can try but wont go all the way to eat."
Very convenient
Great variety of foods.
Its big and spacious.
Ma La Xiang Guo Hao Chi
Many foods to choose here 
Small mall but the hawker centre on 22nd level which has many good varieties.
"Did a walk around, very interesting building with a string community conection, intergrating natyre in the design. Visited the community gardens. Foodcourt had some rojak and starfruit juice."
Food choices aren't as much as other places but for me it is sufficient.
"Lots of varieties foods there.Very convenient.
Great access for those who went for their Medical check up."
Whole place is a better mall than other malls in woodlands so far. More variety of foods there. They have emergency care which is good if one doesnt need or too far from the nearest hospital. Overall great place to be at at any time of the day!
The popiah seller is very rude and stickup. Don't buy from them. There are better food in the hawker centre.
"One of the "" most beautiful ""  Christmas tree in the whole of Kampong Admiralty and some said the Whole of Singapore and just one or two said Whole  World.

Only my personal view ."
"Small but vibrant. Ntuc supermarket and hawkercentre. There are specialist clinics at 3rd and 4th level.
Part of 4th are residents units. The upper level was designed for the senior residents housing.
Many eateries, opposite and around the amenities."
"There are variety of food, Chinese, Malay, Indian etc. plenty of tables & seats. Walk around & choose the food which u like. Choose your table & reserve by putting something on the table. Q at yr favorite stall & order your food, pay cash/cards etc.  Bring food to your table & enjoy your food. When done can Q for your drinks but leave something to reserve your table, there are desserts/fruits bring them to your table. When finish bring all your plates etc on the tray, return them the ""Tray return section."""
"Located just outside of, and next to, Admiralty MRT station, this is a great place to meet someone where you need the surrounding to be serene. It has some of my favourite fastfood outlets like McDonald's, KFC, A&W (yes, long lost, and this fast food chain is back in SG!). Good for meeting outside of school hours so that students from nearby schools would not disturb your serenity. Other fast food outlets are Old Chang Kee, Bo Jian (chwee kueh), Dough culture (you Tian, etc), Chinese Street food (interesting spread that we see on youtube), local fried bee hoon stall (vegetarian) with very good & competitive pricing (value buy!), Bakeinc(?), and many others."
"I had a vegetarian been hoon from the hawker centre
I like it"
Spacious and nice place to chill. With the extra large ceiling fans the area is very breezy. Hawker center at the top floor with a host of shops below great for a relaxing workout after a meal without the heat
Mediocre food. Nasi Penyet so so.
"Decent food center. Rlly love the mala xiang guo, cheap affordable and most importantly delicious. Is a bit diff from outside practice, you choose the ingredients and no. of pax, the stall owner will take it for you. I spent around 14 ish for this set. Super worth."
"Pictures taken show more about the current kid's carnival.

Kampong Admiralty was newly renovated after covid and housed a number of amenities in strategic location just next to the MRT station. It is not a mall, but it has almost everything. Almost.

Good:
- A lot of outdoor seating areas at the void.
- Huge fans to help with the air circulation
- Food stalls scattered around with big, medium, and small food courts.
Facilities like home necessity shops, three supermarket (small to medium), one wet market, medical clinics, small money changer and photo shops and other small shops.
- Well connected transportations.
- Parking

Not so good:
- Can be very noisy and crowded during events with high level of noise even to a distance away.
- Cleanliness are questionable lately, there are almost always thrashes around.
- Toilet at the MRT was in another world, it was very disgusting and dirty the last time I had to use it. Now I believe it's undergoing renovation (I hope). The newer one inside the aircon shopping area is not clean as well.
- Even with three supermarkets and a wet market, sometimes we can't find what we are looking for because they don't have good variety of goods. For example, baking necessity. There is only one brand of whipping cream sold and it sucks.
- Should have more useful shops like tools, stationeries, household daily necessities instead of another decorative, pawn or gold shops, or overpriced food.
- Used to have banks but no banking facilities now, except machines.
- Almost all food courts serve mediocre food, over crowded, not very clean, and overpriced.
- One parking building only have one lift access that is always overcrowded, the other at Kampong is better. However, both don't have washing facilities."
"Favorite food & drink: Waffle , soy bean,"
Great dining experience.. sweets reservations desserts
Decent food
Community shopping mall...so don't expect much there...
Great place to taste local food in all its varieties and glory. Hawker food galore . Supermarket nearby. Fast food around every corner. MRT station nearby.......easy peasy.....
Good place
Tried the vegetarian stall tucked at the back
Always love the delicious foods there 
"A nice place to just sit and pass time. Have a good variety of shops, from massage, foot reflexology to gadget, ntuc, fast food and hawker centre on 2nd floor. Admiralty place is just a stone throw away too."
"Large, comfortable and well-ventilated hawker centre. Could be cleaner though."
bad and unhygienic fruit stall drink. please avoid. they pre-squeeze the juice and never cover and leave it in the open. Ew
Good place to try different cuisine
I eat a lot here brings back a lot of memories
Can use CDC vouchers as payment
The food is nice
Fei Chang Re Nao Shi Wu Bu Cuo
"Good place bustling with business. Disappointed to find female toilet (behind Coffee Bean and Tea leaf, next to wet market) no soap at all from all 5 dispenser. Can hear the movementand sound, nothing comes out. Toilet also has mild odour. Checklist by 800 serbice provider was done 23/3/24. Hope management follow up on this"
"i work around this area, love the atmosphere..especialy the top sky garden.."
A bustling lovely place with eateries & cafes around. Take a visit to the upper levels to visit the rooftop gardens which can be quite relaxing and quiet.
This place is accessible by MRT. It is very big shopping and food centre. The food court is at the 2nd floor. We didn't go there for food but to get a spectacle done up.
Lots of places to shop outstanding heartland mall
"Love the mala here, cheap and affordable! A lot of ammenties and shops around, very accessible if you are living around the area!"
Nice place with affordable and good variety of food. The Thai food and Ayam Penyet is especially tasty
cheap and good place to go.selling popular food such as chicken rice.mee rebus.to have good food all day .this is the location.
Price hiked from 90 cents to $1.10 for a cup of coffee. Standard remains good.
Everything you need for elderly care and a bit of self care is here!!
Pretty basic place! Not like woodlands mall at all. Neighborhood vibe type of shops with little options for hawker halal food.
Good and healthy meesua. Good for people avoiding oily food and training to be more health conscious
i lost my wallet at kampung admiralty and the security and one handsome man returned my lost wallet following my ic address . It's really thankful 
"There is Medical Centre , NTUC Centre for elderly , NTUC , Reatautant and other F&B"
"Nice & friendly environment except Ya Koon Kaya, the worst outlet I ever visit, never recommend any body go there"
An integrated complex with community programme and healthcare services. Located next to Admiralty MRT Station. There are restaurants at level 1 and a food court at level 2.
"Peaceful place with hawker, suoermarket, medical facilities"
Nice halal chicken rice stall in kopitiam
"Thk it main purpose is to bring back the kampong spirit with the associated name. Maybe our country has progressed too fast which I dun find any single soul from there. I believe many will agree with me. BTW, I am formally from a mountain kampong, maybe the last & only existing kampong will be Buangkok. Anyway, this place is another form of shopping mall with supermarkets , shops & food. Juz an ordinary HDB area except wif some special functions (the 24hrs emergency pharmacy or sort of clinic is a gd concept) for taking care of old folks."
"There are Fairprice, LJS, Mos Burgers, Mr Bean, and many hawker stalls on 2nd floor .Has to explore next door Admiralty Place for good mixture of other shops and many more eateries."
Ate at Thai food stall and had the worst food poisoning in my life.
Korean army pot very nice
Kampong Admiralty place has upgraded to a new lease of life.

One of thr busiest MRT stations in Red Line. This is not an Interchangeable station for another MRT Line. However this is the closest station to Woodlands which is the interchangeable station to Brown Line. You cannot find toilets with in the station but free  wifi is provided. There is an elevator people use for laguagues also elderly person use.
Nice square
Went to the Medical Center for eye checkup. Tabao dinner from the food court.
The place is cozy and relaxed for me to have lunch with my wife but I feel that the aircon is not cold enough for me to eat at the place.
A huge food court at level 2
Hawker food not bad
"A neighbourhood mini mall ""Kampung"" getting popular. Variety of food and shop can be found in this Kampung. Even have an A&E hospital located here."
Many years ago Admiralty has changed a lot over the past years and I still remember during my childhood days there was no Aircon at that time and especially eating Macdonald when seating down outside the bird always keep coming in but now is much more better with the new development
It is better now. No more dusty renovation.
Wei Zi Duo Shi Wu Xuan Ze Duo
"Mall transformed to a beautiful place for outing, meals, shop and social interacting"
Was here for the Learning Festival (Raikan Ilmu) organised by MENDAKI on 29th July. The community plaza (level 1 atrium) was well equipped with powerpoints and also lots of seats by the pillars for visitors to sit.
Cheap and nice
"A small place, yet well equipped. A big hawker center, food court and fast food restaurants. 3 supermarkets: Fairprice, Prime and Giant in the same area."
Full range of local hawker food and good facilities next to Admiralty MRT
It has variety of hawker food at the 2nd floor. Halal section is only 1/3 of the whole place. I'd recommend the nasi ambeng at warung lorong fatimah however u will need to be there way early as it is limited stock.
"Variety of food available, very large open-atmosphere area. Good place to find the foods you are pleased with. On Mayday when I went there with a friend to enjoy dum Briyani at Kopitiam after 1230 pm, it was quite crowded and had to find a table for some length of time. This time, on Saturday night around 9 pm, it was crowded but lucky to have a table."
Good selection of individual food stores for everyone who is into local Singaporean fare.
Good place to have breakfast.. there is air conditioning.. unlike Causeway point which is very hot and stuffy in the mornings
"Spaciuos, very windy, with food varities, chinese, indian, malay and western food."
More shops than before. Convenient for NTUC shopping and loading items. Feel the rebuild was done well. Good job!
lots of life and variety of shops...
Newly built eateries and shops! Air-conditioned place with an A&W
Nice place to have gathering with friends or family

Weekend difficult to get table."
"Many new shops. Have prime, food fare, swee heng,old chang kee, macs, kfc, subway, a&w and others... have clinics and yoga studio at 3rd floor too. Connects to old food court at L2 .Makes it more convenient for residents here."
Nice..Lvl 3 play area faster open pls
Many shops there for food
Best mall to get anything under one roof.
Newly renovated mall with more shops.
"The Malay drink stall is rude, talks in Malay and trys to make fun of customers they don't like. Their drinks are more expensive and they do not have good hygiene. Do avoid this stall."
It was crowded
Not bad after so many years of renovating at last. But saldy nothing over there is 24hrs. Except for coffeebean
"lots of food and drink options, although its a bit weird to have 3 bubble tea shops clustered together. do make sure to explore the 2nd and 3rd floor too."
"Anything you need for dine in or take away and fast food, multi nationality food, household wares, clothing, watch, clinics, florists, branded bags, gold, they have all here"
Plenty variety of food and seating.
Ya kun.. cool.
A good place for hawker food. Lots of variety to choose from. Definitely a value for money food centre to explore......
"A very big hawker with many type of food's choices, from rice to mee, from halal to non-halal, as long you can think of, you can find."
"Nice place with good food at the hawker centre, the Zumba classes was very noisy tho, so definitely come and eat before it starts"

"Nicely constructed space, windy and cool. Plenty of choice at the food court, both halal and non halal. NTUC is there too."
"The ah ma mee sua is nice. It's not expensive, taste great and packed with ingredients. Must try again. I have tried several mee sua stalls around Singapore in the past, but I will always come back to this one whenever I am craving for a bowl of mee sua. It's just that unexplainable special."
"Suburban mall with good mix of retailers. Hawker center, medical facilities, you name it, they have it."
good project
"During (heavy) rainy days, many areas are wet and slippery. Potential safety risk for slip and fall."

The hawker centre is full of varieties food to choose from! Good place!
Nice airy and spacious foodcourt. Tried the pig's organ soup with mee sua. It was delish. The laksa here is supposedly good but did not get to try it cos it was sold out.
There is a lot of Halal and Non Halal food to eat here.
"long queue for drinks ordering,NEVER think to improve it."
"Awesome place..
Now having a variety of shops for convenience..

One of the most convenient places in Woodlands. Almost everything you need is here. Check out the new Admiralty shopping alleys.
Spacious and lots of choices
Newly renovated. More organised and food Court at second floor used t9 be have transformed into A&W and a small food Court mainly selling Halal foods. Very convenience and nice.
"This place is in the heart of town, crowded with people during peak hours."
"One of the very best places in Singapore's residential areas. Kampung Admiralty brings us all the needed shops, restaurants, event halls, etc. Loving it."
"The Ah Mah mee suah , the prawn mee soup or dried , the loh mee, thts how i will try all three in small size . There r superb.

The wanton mee dumplings w chicken feets also nice cooked by ladies w experience .

The crunchy roti pratas always in process w long ques."
"Nice place to eat anf hangouts.
Many shop and budget friendly.
Just beside Admiralty MRT"
Finally they have an A&W outlet there.  Add this to the many food stalls and restaurants near the MRT and at the Level 2 food court and you have a Food Heaven!!!! 
Nice place a lot of eatry
"The escalator leading up to the hawkers center change direction every month which I think might be inconvenient to the elderly. Cannot imagine how this kind of structure still can get ""Award-winning"" project..."
"The new Kampung Admiralty x Admiralty place has A&W! But there are still vacant units, not all are taken up yet."
"New shopping recently, primer retailers operate 24 hrs.. A&W newly opened but crowded.."
"The hawker centre has some nice and affordable food - mee sua, lor mee, malaxiangguo to name a few. Tea/coffee are about $1 which is rare nowadays. But getting seats is usually an issue."
Refused to accept 2 five cents coin for payment at fish ball noodle stall
Bustling but clean space with many dining options including a well-ventilated hawker centre on the second level. Love the community garden on the roof!
"Admiralty getting better each day.  After Admiralty Place completed,  more choices - more food stalls,  shops, supermarket etc...  Now can see long QUEUE buying 4D, TOTO, BIG SWEEP ."
"Have not been here for sometime now due to their renovation works there, decided to give a try if there is anything for us to eat for dinner. Kampung Admiralty is as busy as ever."
"Nothing much...
First time vjsit.."
"Kampung Admiralty house a healthcare facility, senior care, kindergarten, supermarket, a number of F&B outlets and a social enterprise managed hawker centre which offered a good variety of reasonably priced food that cater for different races."
"The coffee counter near the malay food stall is always short of staff. Sometimes you can see a long line of customers waiting to order. Why don't they put 2 staff members in the morning to curb the queue. The malay lady alone making coffee, becoming a cashier and the coffee and tea she makes is very horrible. Hancai bocai one she make. When ask there is no spoon, she just says ya no spoon. So sarcastic. Hope this coffee counter can be improve on their service."
Okay so far since some shops are still renovating.

Local delights with different varieties of food with affordable prices.
I dropped by to work here once in a while. Nice place to have a cup of coffee and decently priced breakfast. There is a variety of food to try.  I havent finished trying all the stalls yet so best not comment yet
"The Community Plaza is a fully public, porous and pedestrianised ground plane, designed as a community living room. Within this welcoming and inclusive space, the public can participate in organised events, join in the season's festivities, shop, or eat at the hawker centre on the 2nd storey. The breezy tropical plaza is shaded and sheltered by the Medical Centre above, allowing activities to continue regardless of rain or shine.

Big space just behind mrt stn. 2nd floor with cooked food stalls. Three halal dood stalls with long que. May be good food
Not much changes since last visit as it's quite nicely revamped once. Sorry place because of the support large fans.
Good for having morning breakfast and lunch as well  liked by local netizen
Variety of hawker food there but limited seat there
Decent food at affordable price
"Lots of choice for food.
Own n nearby hdb parking.
Right next to mrt.
Got also medical center than can take care of simple emergencies instead of going A&E at hospital."
"Have improved a lot after 2 decades leave in Woodlands Drive. I must say it a Big change. Thank you to Woodlands TC for the hard work. Love the foods at level 2. Especially the chicken rice, tahu Goreng and few other Malay foods."
Cost place for family dining or get-together with friends
"Nice place to chill and the hawker centre Alots of foods there, try it"
"wowbiggest double thumbs upworld best building design in 2O12a building complete with hospital, fast food restaurant, residential house, shopping complex, mini floral garden, train services, education and training center & frozen food centreall foods stall in second level are very delicious & cheap.everyday heavy with human traffic.36O0 beautiful scenery and beautiful sunset"

Modern Kampong. Buzzing with people eating on wkends
Quite happening as activities are mostly available. Alot of food and quite a bit to explore around if your first visit.
Very green
"Kampong admiralty hawker centre. Vegetarian stall has a reasonable though not a lot to choose from. Taste is just average,more like satisfying hunger, do not expect too much. I asked for white rice which is not available,only brown rice. Taste of the dishes are also not very tasty."
Big space for community to laze around
Spacious and breeze with big ceiling fans. Very community friendly.
Not so cheap food court.
"Why some of halal foodstalls closed today?No point there's halal stalls here,if Sat also closed!Like this how to support?Might as well close forever if lazy to do business"
Nice place with wide variety of food mainly and not too crowded.
The hawker centre on Level 2 was a surprise. Large variety of local food at extremely reasonable prices (considering the price increases at many other places).
Wide range of foods
"Vry cool some days,rainy days often happen."
Lousy dishes tasteless food at Yassin KAMPONG Very disappointed
"Lots of useful features within reach like a hawker center, medical center, wet market and even a MRT station."
"A great neighbourhood venue. Being so accessible to the Admiralty MRY Station which is just a stone-throw away, itnis very bustling. NTUC Fairprice, fast food outlets, hawker centre, food court and of course the AMC, Admiralty Medical Centre which help take a load off KTPH and of course more convenient than KTPH."
Nice place. Have a hawker center with cheap and nice food
Clean as you go
Bangunan yang bagus
"7-11, Yasin and long john silvers. Everything you want is here"
everyday go there dabao after work
One stop for hawkers food cheap good taste..There also one stop Medical Services with minor ops room
Upgrading in progress.
"Limited number of shops but the food court on level 2 has good food, and is well ventilated. But also crowded."
2022 change new note
Good food all round
"Neighborhood hub, you can find supermarket, fast food, snack, hawker center, medical center."
Good and reasonably priced food here.
The place is cool by high ceiling big fan. There is a ntuc supermarket at basement 1 and a posb besides it. On the 1st floor is a clinic n dispensary. There is a Japanese ice cream shop on the 1st floor. You can find a malay restaurant there. This place is built for the elderly to stay which is housed above the foodcourt. This make it convenient for the elderly to get food anytime. Besides this place is the admiralty mrt station so it is easily accessible.
Medical center
Urgent Care Facility is a life saver. Do note its opening hours and types of treatment.
"Yao Chi Hen Duo Xuan Ze,Zan"
"Very cosy and lush Community Garden at rooftop L8 via lift.  Wheelchair friendly.
Also another smaller garden with outdoor fitness machines L6.  Great hawker ctr on L1. Grd flr  open space public chill area surrounded by sit down eateries (Ya Kun, Mr Bean, Mos Burger, Starbucks & a large Malay restaurant offering $6.80 weekday set lunch; includes free drink + soup).
Good deal fresh fish (seabass/snapper buy1 get 1) n frozen convenience food)."
"Big spacious hawker center with high ceiling and huge fans. Very windy. Integrated with clinics, home for elderly, and Fair Price supermarket downstairs."
Kuih2 is the best there!! Try it to believe.
Well decorated HDB buildings
pleasant hawker centre....
"Hao,Fei Chang De Hao "
Lots of food options
its ome of its kind construction
Good place. Friendly neighbourhood.
"My 1st time here and the place is full of amenities such as fast food, hawker Centre, medical care and even supermarkets and banks."
"Really quite angry eating here. Everything bought is a huge different from the pictures displayed. Bought a sausage tube rice from one of the recommended in google. But i only got the l chang and claypot rice, which the picture showed assorted sausages. Then decided to try the dessert from Hot and Cold desserts. ordered a bobochacha and what can go wrong? i only got yams and sweet potatoes. what happened to the colours of the dessert. Hawkers should also take the initials to tell us what is not available that day or tell us what they do not supply. was looking forward to trying the food here but to much disappointment. Its honeslty my second and last time eating here."
"Review from residence at admiralty, highly recommend some food stall eg: lor mee stall, fishsoup, fried yong Taufu, Ayam penyet and chicken rice stall. Worth to try!"
"Very well designed, the ground level has spacious compound with seats. Second level houses a foodcourt, 3rd and 4th level housed  a Medical centre."
Food court always overcrowded!!!
...white  carrot cake on a rainy day . Branch located at Kampong Admiralty 
Nice place
"Woth renovation of admiralty place, not many options for shopping. A hawker centre on 2nd floor,  starbucks and Chateraise on 1st floor and a NTUC fair price in basement are the only reasons i go there."
"Places with good variety of food with affordable price, recommended"
It houses Admiralty Medical Centre on Levels 3 & 4. And there is a food court on L2 offering a wide variety of food.. There is also NTUC in the basement level. Cool place!
Conveniently located next to Admiralty MRT Station. Buzzing with people and shops. Main carpark presently under repair and available from the 6th floor.
"Variety of food at food courts with affordable price, clean environment n spacious "
High ceiling and well ventilated.
a very nice place for food and meet up
"A great place where doctors, nurses and administrative staff provides attention and care. Highly recommended!"
Awesome place
"Good for Old people, families  and well laid out plan. There is a NTUC and a POSB at Basement.
Many activities at the pavilion for Heartlanders to minggle and make friends."
"There is no parking space for cyclists,only  cater for delivery cyclist. And the security guards is probably not well trained as I experienced conflicting instructions. Just only today,I was told not to park my bicycle there since last year,I was told by the security guards to park my bicycle at that very area where the delivery cyclist located. Only today that malay aunty stop me from doing so. The Kampung Admiralty management better rectify this no parking bicycle space for public users as parking space around the other location is always full and slightly far. We uaer uses our bicycle for commuting and buying groceries. Please management,read this comment."
"Don't you ever order in this stall:
LONG DING SEAFOOD...CASHIER VERY RUDE!!"
Good place for food office and shop
"Don't really like the place, maybe is still renovating. The food court is on 2 levels, have few good stalls. Don't go during rush hours, Weekends, Sundays and PH. Too crowded for comfort."
"Went to this place to shop for essential and lunch. Prices at the good mall is affordable and have wide variety, from vegetarian, Chinese, Muslim and Indian cusine. There is also a bakery stall. There are other coffee place like(e Starbuck and super market. Accessible by public transport and self driving."

After 9 pm hardly got foid to eat
"I like ths place. Just dun come during mid afternoon or u'll feel like ""melting"" frm the blazing sun."
"Good hawker center where we can get everything veg and non-vegetarian food. Ice cream, ice Kachang,indian,malay,chinese food. Etc"
"Convenient place.

I love this place cause it is elderly and young people to shop around and it being convenient for others
Family place. Though not much of shops. But calm to the eye and mind.

Gan Jing Shi Wu Yu Jie Qian Gong Dao. 
Good envoirement

A lot of nice food here..
Usually come here for breakfast after sending my child.
"The gem of this place is the rooftop garden, and also how greenery is built into a residential and community space. Hawker centre at level 2 is well ventilated.
Connected to Admiralty mrt, you'll see it once u exit the station!"
"Had my usual breakfast of porridge and you tiao..more variety of food as well..caters for breakfast, lunch and dinner."
Easy access by public transport
The cheapest bfast will ever get.
"I'm no architect but there are design issues with this space. Entry into the carpark is at a very sharp corner, heavy reliance on passenger lifts to move people in between floors instead of escalators and stairs. The escalator to hawker centre is for one direction only (up)"
Too crowded
Lotsa of foods and convenient for those leaving nearby
Good hawker stalls and rooftop garden to chill.

Since open on phrase 2 it always busy as usual.The food here is very delicious.I like buying dessert ice kacang and chendol there very hmmm marvelousss.
"Open space,beautiful greenery and lots of food"

A lot of shops are still under renovation....
One of the best Hawker center in Singapore
Parking Problem a lot vehicles.But good place all under 1 roof
"Located just in front of Admiralty MRT Station a medium size shopping mall. The food court is located at level 2, one of it is with air conditioning and the other is without. I visited the one with air condition. This food court have Thai food, Korean and Japanese food, Vegetarian food, chicken rice and many others. But l notices that the Thai, Korean and Japanese, the Vegetarian food always have many people patronize. I try the Thai food the taste is not bad their fried sea bass is very nice and is crispy and comes with a reasonable price.
Well you guys can try it out and see how is the taste because different people have different tastes. Thanks "
"First time dining here. The place is clean, more choices fpr halal food."
"atmosphere is great  but its good for those uncles/aunties can give up their space for those who are dining in instead of playing checkers there..otherwise, is great"
A very convenient place to collect parcels and to get variety of IT gadgets and accessories.
"A very nice concept of a Hawker Center, very open area with good ventilation while being sheltered from the elements.

Food options here are quite wide, with quite a lot of choices for halal and non-halal options. My go-tos are the Thai store, Ah Beng Fried Rice, Bak Kut Teh and the Chinese food.

Seating may be an issue only during peak hours, but there are plenty of huge tables that you can share with other people, which in turn could also help promote socialising with others if that's your thing.

Prices are quite affordable as well, good for elderly to lepak with friends here and also affordable for students to hangout and have lunch after school."
The first and the beginning of integrated development.
"The good and the bad.

Starting with the bad:

Avoid drink stall ""teh tarik drinks"". I ordered the longan ice drink - it was shown there to be $2.30, but when it came up, the uncle suddenly told me it's $2.60. I told him the menu states $2.30. and he said rudely and defensively ""don't see there lah, that's the old price, the price is go by the computer system here at the cashier"". I told him, then you guys should update the price on the board. Then he said ""it's my boss set one, not me"". Even so - he should inform the customer on the price before making the drink, instead of surprising him after the drink is done.

And honestly, if he were to say it nicely, I would just nicely let it go, but it's the way he said it - in a rude and gaslighting way.

I'm angry not at the 30C/ difference I have to pay, but the principle of it.. and the way he rudely and disrespectfully answered, despite being in the wrong.

That's false advertising.

In the end I just took the drink and go because I was very thirsty and shops were closing soon.

When I tasted the drink, I tasted that the drink isn't even mixed well - all the plain water and ice at the top, and just a little bit of sweet taste at the bottom. So I went back to the drink stall, and politely asked if they have the wooden stick to stir. That same uncle took out a straw and very rudely told me ""by right I cannot anyhow take straw, later NTUC not happy"". Hello? Firstly I'm not asking for straw. Secondly, if cannot give or don't have, just say don't have. Still have the cheek to gaslight me the 2nd time. So defensive, narcissistic and so in need to avoid accountability until must act until like that. Power. And of course I didn't took the straw.

So yes, avoid that drink stall. Useless staff like to avoid accountability for wrongdoing and blame shift and gaslight their customers, so they ""don't lose face"". Pathetic. Low EQ and incompetent to do simple things.

As for the rest of the stalls, the China food stall started out fine and great, but over time became more cranky and rude.

As for the rest, the dim sum stall aunty have always been friendly and nice. Majority of the stalls there were quite friendly.. greeted me politely and welcomed me. Have yet to tried their food. Next time will try.

atmosphere there at night at around 8.30pm onwards, is not bad, compared to other hawker centres."
"It's only my third visit here after so many years, and I'm surprised by how popular the Muslim food stalls are at Kampung Admiralty Hawker Centre--even on a weekday dinner hour. The queues were so long I almost fainted just looking at them!

I ended up choosing Soon Kee Roasted Delights. The roast pork skin was crispy and flavourful--loved the crunch. The lower layer had quite a bit of thick, soft fat, which fans of that texture would definitely enjoy. I even added some chicken rice chilli to my plain white rice (I know, unorthodox), and it turned out surprisingly tasty. 

Although the space is large and not too crowded, I still had a hard time finding a seat. 

But hey, taste and service are always subjective. "
"Saamsudeen Indian Muslim stall, sell nasi dumb briyani mutton, chicken, delicious food.
Prata egg onion, prata cheese egg oso yummy, crispy, hot, being made on the spot as u ordered.
Bravo"
"A lot of food choices here..
From nature brizz till aircond .
Services varry depend on the place.
But its cool place to meet or hang out"
Wide variety of food selection. Affordable and delicious too. Can't go wrong with testing different kinds of food there. Good place to catch up with friends and colleagues.
Many stalls around. All looks good.
"[2025]

Might try other stalls next time. Good and above average comfort food court! The western stall has great chicken chop rice and affordable with salad below $9! The portion is quite big for a low-mid size eater."
"Modern and open space hawker centre with high ceilings and big as fan (sorry might get banned for spelling the real name). The food here is affordable but taste wise, very plain and basic, catered to the old people. The Bak Kut teh that food king reviewed is over hyped (see my review for this). Pleasantly surprised by the ah Ma meesua when I gave it a second chance. It tastes better when dining in than take away. Avoid egg tarts at all costs as it tastes like rock. Friend say it's usually good but when he bought at 8pm, the taste is bad.

One downside is the seats. Very hard to find proper seats especially during peak hours as the seats are all weirdly shaped and built for 8-10 people. The designer of this place doesn't know that loners with no family or friends exist in the society. Even for family of 2, also need to share table. I guess, if you like to make friends with strangers sitting at the same table, do give here a visit."
Nice clean
Wonderful place for dim sum . Awesome to get a cup of coffee with some quick bites .
"Nasi Ayam Penyet ($6.80). Delicious marinated chicken thigh (albeit frozen) with a crisp skin, perfect with the spicy sambal and rice (remember to ask for the curry)! A comforting meal."
I had the best maklouba ever . The chef is Abdor. World class man.
Awesome & great food
A not so crowded food centre in the weekend offering a variety of cooked food at reasonable prices. Well ventilated clean and spacious with an NTUC Fairprice supermarket in the basement.
"As a local Singaporean, I was pleasantly surprised to find numerous food stalls offering delicious meals for just $3! Contrary to the belief that affordable dining is hard to come by in our city, these budget-friendly options are not only tasty but also showcase our vibrant food culture.

For anyone looking to enjoy great meals without spending a fortune, I highly recommend exploring these $3 stalls. It's an excellent way to experience the flavors of Singapore!"
"We forgot Gard holders on the table, after that morning time we came asked staff and supervisor there, one of staff keep it back for us , we very happy , thank you"
"Some of the utensils are not cleaned properly. Food is not outstanding but ok. Some of the stalls are better than most of the rest. This hawker center is probably more convenient for most folks because it has elevators (6 numbers, I think), escalators, front and back, near to the Admiralty MRT Station and the medical related facilities on the upper floors of the building. I think the management needs to check the cleanliness of the utensils.  Please make sure they are properly washed and cleaned for people to use."
"$3.60 for 2 veg and 1 meat. Portion too small. Not worth
In addition, the staff is rude and not willing to serve"
"Mai You Tiao Gao Dian De auntyFei Chang Mei Li Mao,Mei Ren Huan Jia Zhuang Mang Lu Bu Li Gu Ke,Nan Guai Mei Ren Yao Qu,Da Jia Bie Qu Liao,Qi Ta Tan Wei Jiu Hao Duo Liao. "
Good choice of food but always crowded at peak hours
Lots of selection to choose from
Love the options here!
Not enough seats during lunch time and dinner time. Hungry ghosts occupy seats for their fiends/ family members.
Wo Xi Huan
2nd storey is affordable food centre with wide variety of local foods. Closed 2 days Monthly for general cleaning. Pack during lunch and dinner time.
Great place to have your meals.
"Its good to have this kind of morning or evening exercise, its good for people that have nothing to do, they feel bored, especially for senior citizen."
"Woodlands , admiralty residents could not resist the awesome pricing and varieties of food available ,Malay cuisine, Indian and chinese cuisine all available at a lower price !!!"
It is okay...recommended that all halal certification by muis must displayed at their stalls...
"Fish soup was actually MSG soup. It was loaded with MSG, not fit for consumption."
"Food are not really cheap here as compared to Marsiling Mall. Personally, I still felt that Marsiling Mall offer much more choices & varieties. Whenever I am here, I always go for the famous $2.80 Lor Mee. Just spotted another stall selling Halal Jap food, too bad they only offer the curry rice in the morning session.
There's another famous Yu Kee braised Duck rice, simply love their ikan bilis chilli!
Another is the exotic soup stall. May need more time to explore good cheap yummilicious food!
Update:  since the war in Ukraine/Russia & Isreal/Palestine started in 2022, all prices have increased. Well, may need more time to hunt for economical food..... "
"Mediocre hawker centre at best! Nothing much in the morning as breakfast options. Plus the non-halal drinks stall had a really long queue, so opted for the halal alternative, but the coffee was super watered down. 1st and last time probably"
"Food are generally up to standard, price are mostly fare among hawker pricing, facility are modern."
"cutlery no wash properly, Malay drink stall need to improve their attitude to customer. Best Roti Canai in Singapore"

A good mix of local food. Very popular with the residents and visitors to this area. Cashless payments through the more popular platforms such as Grab among many others are accepted. Prices are reasonable. Lots of seating.
Near my resident area 
Always a pleasure to eat here especially for breakfast! The stall that sells Laksa is done by a chinese lady but its halal of cause & stall is always long queue! Chicken rice stall next to it also from chinese cooks but halal and the rice itself is worth to eat on it own..!
"Except Ya Koon Kaya, the worst outlet I ever visited. Never recommend anybody to go this outlet."
"The Chinese popiah was terrible - soggy and bland.
The hawker (not sure he or she) was rude and slow. Treating the customers like beggars - begging to eat."
"I had the yau Tau foo noodle, is good, portion is value for money. Upon finish the portion is filling....a sense of satisfaction."

Overall is good and there is a good selections of food you can pick to enjoy. Generally clean place with fans installed so it won't be too hot or humid to have your meals there.
"Not much to shout about. Good for occasional diners but if you stay around the area, the choices become limited."
The portion is huge and the taste not bad. The noodle is well cooked.
"Bought economical rice from Chang Cheng. 2 vegetables and 1 fish. Written on a small board in front of the cashier says 2 vegetables + 1 fish = $5.30. The lady said it costs $6.30. When I asked her why it is a dollar more than what's written on their board, she said fish is a minimum charge of $4. Then I said if there is a minimum charge of $4, you should state it on a sign. And I told her for such a small piece of fish, how can you charge $4? I then checked with her about the other slightly bigger piece, and she said $6. Then she continued saying I could change the fish out since there isn't sauce or gravy on it. I said the fish is already on the plate, it's ok. Next time, I will not order fish since it is so expensive. Worst of all, the fish is not fresh and doesn't taste nice. The quality of the white rice used is lousy, tasted hard, and not fragrant. The portion of the ingredients given is small. Eg. 2 small pieces of chicken and 1 small piece of potato for curry chicken.  Will not buy from them ever again."
"We came especially for the Maqluba Lamb Shank at Taibah. It was authentic middle-eastern fare at a fraction of the price! The Egyptian gentlemen are friendly and they serve hearty portions.
We can't wait to try Mandhi and the other offerings.
Syukran, Taibah!"
Good food and it's clean and airy

Well-ventilated and spacious. Good variety of food and generally quite affordable.
"variety of popular local food available at affordable price, better than the usual air conditioned food court. .. new stall selling Pao Fan serves delicious rice in soup bases"
one of the best economical noodles i have eaten plus its only $3.70 which is quite value for money so if you are looking for a cheap and affordable meal this stall is a go to
"There are a lot of food stalls and varieties.  Price reasonable and at low side. Spacious, but it's still not easy to find a seat."
1st visit.. spacious and airy hawker centre on 2nd fl..
"Local food serve, a lot of variety cuisine offer "
"The true meaning of kampung spirit in Singapore. Navigate for the meaning of ""kampung"" and you will find the definition that outlines that, Kampung spirit is an important part of Singapore's treasured heritage, the kampung (village) spirit refers to a sense of community and solidarity. One can definitely feel such ambience in this hawker centre. From Malay cuisine to Chinese and even foreign cuisine such as Korean & China, a broader range of meal selection that widens the Kampung Admiralty and not restrictive to only local community common dish. Economical, affordable price and spacious to dine. Check out the variety of meals offering at this admirable Kampung Admiralty Hawker Centre!"
Quite a number of stalls were close on Sunday afternoon. Best to go there for breakfast.
Love the airy space and good food!
"This food court is getting worse. When it was brand new, it was nice to sit around under the huge fan as the area was spacious and there are a lot of food stalls around, but over time it went downhill.

There are a lot of space for sitting areas but for some reason, some areas are left empty instead of allocating chairs and tables. During peak hour it would be almost impossible to find seats and when you do, they are usually filthy.

I will repeat this for every food court in Singapore. It is building towards good habit of clearing your own tray, but most food court doesn't pass the cost saving to consumers and are not conducive AT ALL in enforcing the habit. I hate to compare it but in Japan, they also have the same rules but you'd see clean tables everywhere, because they always provide cleaning clothes on the tables and hand sanitizer. But in Singapore, who is supposed to have the reputation of clean country, there is no such thing after covid. It is simple but no, so most tables are sticky and filthy, sometimes the floor too. And recently the food court got rid of most tray stations except the main ones. It's hard enough to navigate the big food court empty handed. Again, there are spaces for temporary tray stations and they used to have multiple. I guess they continue to cut cost in the effort to make it worse.

Some of the food stalls are unnecessary rude to the customers. I didn't only experience it myself, but saw some elderly being scolded by the staff for something similar. It was a stall named Yew Kee. For my case, the stall was already opened, everything was in display and the staff was standing there, but when you wanted to order, she ignored you and played with her phone. And when you ask again just to confirm if it's opened, she scolded me with loud voice and asked what did I want to order. Well, thank you. Not for me. Yes, the stall was opened and she indeed ignored the customers and after that, treated you like you own them your life and your first child. I saw some one treated exactly the same.

Just go there when you absolutely have to. Sadly, food courts are much needed in Singapore so they will continue to prosper on the expense of their customers."
Nice chatting place and cost saving place to go for residents.
ok....no comment

Foods tastes is moderate to me. Tables usually dirty & wet. Lifts closing too fast.
Cheap local delicacies
"The beef is cooked to perfection, tender, and full of savoury goodness. Each piece is expertly seasoned, adding a rich and meaty dimension to the dish. The fried rice itself is a masterpiece. The grains are separate and fluffy, cooked just right so that they don't become mushy. The combination of fragrant rice, soy sauce, and other seasonings creates a delicious base that complements the beef beautifully. The moment you take your first bite, you're greeted with a harmonious blend of flavours and textures. Enjoyed as a quick lunch on a busy day , beef fried rice from this stall never fails to hit the spot. A must-try for anyone who loves a delicious and filling meal. With its perfect combination of beef, rice, and vegetables, it's a dish that is sure to please your taste buds and leave you wanting more."
Nice place to eat but always overcrowded
the prata store always long queue
Food is amazing especially the mala and blue pea nasi lemak will definitely return
The Malay drink stall lady service was bad she had very bad mannerism in her speech I hope my feedback will change her attitude the authorities should monitor their behaviour which they fail to do so after many feedback the proper authority should step forward and make a stern action against the stall owners.there should be digital feedback counter at the stall.please monitor and investigate.i wonder if there's CCTV watching the stall owners
As I Ben there one of my favourite places every week
"1st time ate here. Food was good.

2nd time, got stomach ache. Chicken was lukewarm and not fresh.

Staff especially the auntie is rude.

Will be giving this stall a miss."
Always no seats
Lots of good foods here. Worth to come.
Decent food
Always my choice for makan place
One of the nicer hawker centres.  Clean and well ventilated. Good spread of food choices
Nothing much to share not much variety food but still ok ok
Food was variety of choices.. Problems is only the seating area around of muslim stalls.. Sorry but the olds timers love to sit and drink beers around that area. Quite difficult to get seat during the peak hours in the evening..
Super slow service at the drinks stall. I have never queue for 15mins at a drinks stall before.
Love the array of food available here but the escalator is kinda troublesome. Abit too big for me as i cant find my table at times. No air-con.
For a quick meal ok n food.also was.ok
No comment
I loved the Avocado Juice!! It was so creamy and had lots of flavor. I also ordered the Quesedilla and it was heavenly! I loved the chicken and pepper bells! My sister ordered the Curry Rice with Udang Penyet. It was very delicious as well! Loved this place. :)
There's a hawker centre located on 2 storeys and a few restaurants within the vicinity!
Very thing good
Many varieties. Hard to get seats during peak periods
"Great Community
Green living
Wide selection of food at the Super huge FairPrice Hawker. Spacious with many stalls
One of the biggest latest trendy Hawker in  Singapore

Halal stalls selling Sedap food: MeeRubus, MeeSiam, Goreng Pisang, chicken rice

Indian Prata n Rojak are tempting too

Local chinese food like Ah Ma Mee with long Q, economy rice is the largest selection of dishes I ever come across and all looking so good, LorMee Laksa Prawn Mee, DimSum, roasted meat

China food like Mala Pot n especially like the stall with the $18 fried fish in Xiang La version (next time I would try the salted vege version)
Bamboo rice and boil soup

Will be back again with my family to try more food

Insta ju.rine"
A quiet place where you can enjoy your food... strategically located near MRT station...
Nice chicken rice. Worth trying
"Today my favourite Nasi lamak store is closed. No choice but to try the Mxed-Veg rice store since no diner in queue. Noted list price $3.60 for 2veg+1meat. End up asked to pay $8.90 for 2 boxes (2v+1m)!! When questioned why the difference, serving lady claimed 1 box has pork rib which is $2.00 compared with other meat that is $1.30. But when I refer to the list on prices, lady quickly walked off and avoids my queries. Based on its price list, the price does not adds up. No wonder this stall no queue, price ""sukar sukar"" type."
"Jun'24 - came super early to avoid long Q at drink stall.
Only 2 drinks stall, mostly long Q"
"Another food outlet. Local cousine and many Malay foods. Nothing special, but food to have for your craving."
Overpriced. Becareful while makan at this stall.
"Very homely feel, good ventilation with large ceiling fans, ample seating and easily accessible by escalator and lifts. Have a good variety of food, from Arabian to Indian, makay, Chinese, fruits, desserts, Indian Vadai, bread and so on. It's also clean and seats are usually available."
Plenty of variety of food is available.
"Variety of affordable food, plenty of seats and high ceiling with fans."
"Food here is so bad, I've come here a few times, not even looking for good food. But it's just so bad."
Has banger chicken rice.
Boiling hot coffee was served in plastic cups
"Food nice but coffee not nice, very crowded during lunch and dinner time."
You can have some of the most delicious foods 
Highly recommended this stall for pao fan. The $5 scallop king pao fan is cheap and yums with good amount of scallops n clams. Broth is the best. Location of building is very near Admiralty MRT stn
A well developed centre
DO NOT BUY FROM FRUIT STALL!!! their drinks are unhygienic and their service is super rude. drank their sugarcane and found ants inside....
Always packed during peak hours. Economic choice for the bee hoon and nasi lemak stall (the long queue one). Best lontong I had from the Muslim stall (selling Kuih Lopis).
Many options to choose
Loved this place for lunch. Windy and reasonable pricing. Parking is easy and totally sheltered from parking to food court
Quite a huge hawker centre but the hawker centre looks very tired. So the dining experience wasn't great. There are 2 drinks stalls. One of it I tried is the Indian drink stall. One of the worst teh tarik I ever drink.Tasteless and no foam.  Vertical transportation to second level is confusing. Took me a while to figure out how to reach there.
Windy and good food hwre
Want more halal option. Overall good atmosphere
Good variety of  nice food there
Really comfortable and homey atmosphere. Really immersing yourself into what it means to experience the true Singaporean lifestyle. Food was really affordable and decent. I had mess siam and it was really really affordable and tasted just like how meesiam should taste. Highly recommend.
Affordable price here
"It's my neighborhood, I like to stay there and  have food amount of multi culture dishes"
Can use CDC vouchers as payment
Many good food stalls here. You will be almost spoilt for choice.
A nice surprise to find this place nwar the MRT. Cleaner than the average hawker.
"Undoubtedly one of the best food centre around which is nearby to the mrt station, many food outlets, markets and assessible by wheelchairs ... "
"There are many choices of food here the chicken rice is decent
But there are some food that isn't that great
The Nasi Lemak stall here is good"
"Many choices to choose from, feel free to make a trip/visit here!"
Best new gen hawker centres offer competitive foods with many selection unlike other new gen hawker.
"This hawker centre is quite up to date as mostly all stalls can use CDC vouchers as payments, Porridge Mixed Rice,McDonald, KFC, China dishes also available beside Mrt station"
"Bak kut Teh is Excellent

Lack of chairs

Lack of tables

It's reopen
29th May 2022?"
AVOID FRUIT JUICE STALL AT ALL COSTS. WAITED 30 MINUTES FOR MY DRINK AND STILL NEVER SERVE PLUS SKIP MY ORDER. STALL OWNER HAS ATTITUDE ISSUE AND JUST THROW BACK MONEY AT YOU WHEN YOU ASK THEM WHY THEY SERVE BEHIND ORDERS FIRST.
"Ah ma mee sua, the fried Yong tau foo and Ayam penyet is great "
"Third visit to this place after hiking. Food overall alright. Had porridge, big bao, Siew Mai and char Siew bao on all vsits. Quality standard remain as good! Disappointed with the coffees on 3rd visit. Coffee is not hot and the coffee-spoons are terribly stained! Management may wish to look into the cleanliness aspect. Thank you"
There is many choices of tasty food with ample space and seats
"Too Spoilt For Choice, so many stalls with good food"
Lots of good food waiting for you to be there. So get over to feel it yourself.
Kao Hen Hao Chi
"Gen Yi Ban De Shi Ge Yi Yang,Hao Chu Shi Hen Kao Jin Di Tie Zhan Rong Yi Zhao Dao,Xi Huan Chi Na Li De Ya Ma Mian Xian,Su Shi Ye Bu Cuo. Jia Qian Ye Yi Yang. Huan You Ma Lai Shi Wu. Bu Cuo Ke Yi Qu Shi Shi. "
everything is just great here because im working arnd this area as well...alot of food variety to choose...
"The food here is outright mid.

Ordered 4 things

1. Rojak
- not fresh youtiao (got smell)

2. Pineapple fried rice
- blend , cold , not salty enough

3. Char Kway Teow
- outright mid

4. Duck Noodles
- ok la not bad but not the best

Tbh the prices are really affordable but for the taste and portion i think my heart aches for the food."
Good affordable food but during peak hours take time find seats. Lacking of chairs also so you will see people moving chairs around
Vast selection of food.....good to go on weekdays....avoid the weekends where seats are hard to come by
Love the architectural design. Though it is HDB. The lush green and landscape makes it feels like a condominium without facilities
Can we have straws back for people who order drinks here? Do you know how not friendly the customer experience is to drink cold drink with ice directly from cup? And the cup edges are not smooth at all?  Please don't be double standard. Then shouldn't you remove away your take away plastic cups?
The standard at the carrot stall dropped tremendously. My last trip here was more than 6 months ago. Came back to try the carrot cake. The carrot cake stall owners apparently pan-fried the black and white carrot cakes and put them on standby to refry for customers when order was made. This will be the last time I patronised this stall with my family. The black and white carrot cakes were so dry and hard after refrying. It doesn't help when you see the portion shrunk so much from the beginning to the current state. There are better options elsewhere for carrot cake. Give it a miss!
One of the more pleasant hawker centre to dine n. The seats are spacious and the stalls have good variety. Especially like the Thai Food and the Mee Siam stall ($2.80 only). The prices here are really quite affordable and kudos to the stallowners to providing affordable food as compared to foodcourts nowadays.
"The food was so so, we ordered grill fish but it was so so... But the BBQ skewers was great!! It was a great place to chill, clean and air circulation was great."
Must eat fish. Value for money. Most flavorful grilled fish I have ever tried.
Tried the new Mediterranean stall. Had the following food.
Not enough tables and chairs
Very good value for money selections. One of my favourites.
Very good.
Nice food with reasonable prices and good environment.
One of those standard food court that doesn't have any famous stores here. The food are all pretty average. The only complaint I have is that most stores closed at 8pm which kind of make the point of eating here not worth it.. especially when there are only a few choices for consumers to choose from. The pricing is about $4-5... I don't think there is any specific reason to come to this coffee shop unless it's really convenient for you. Because there is nothing for you to look forward to here.
"I just choose to eat at any stall with my mother, the food is very good. Then we try the coffee, it is also very good. The hawker food is just next to Admiralty MRT, which is very convenient."
The cleanliness has slightly improved.
Choice of food but lack Halal food.
Many variety food
"Sekali cuba, kali kali mahu try this fried rice at this hawker centre. Tbh, this fried rice at ""Ah Beng xxxxx(not rmb the name)"" is really nice. Can try to order when the cook is a young man. He serves the best fried rice which really makes me homesick. Ordered the SGD5.5 fried rice with chicken cutlet. I gave this fried rice with full-stars comments."
"I tried the prawn noodles at $4.50. Very Very Expensive. With this price, only provide 3 slices of small half thin prawn, one slice of pork, two thin slices of fish cake. Bee Hoon & mee very little. I don't know with such a price $4.50 is a budget meal for senior citizens. I don't think I will come to this stall to buy my meal anymore although I don't stay around these area. The owner must think that the senior citizens staying around the Admiralty that  come here for meals are well to do family. The roasted stalls I think the price is still reasonable as they do have $3.80 meals. I regret that I should buy the roasted pork rice instead of prawn noodles"
"have to try the niang tou fu, it's good."
Love the hawker ambience which sharing of table is common.. choices of food was decent. Price was definitely good!
Good variety of foods. I like the ah ma mee sua!
Food like Laska tasted good. The price of coffee and laska are reasonable and can be considered not as expensive as some coffeeshop.
"Love the heavenly wang at adm!
Admiralty place is a lifestyle not just a place.
It's a community
Also 5/5 for vibes "
Food is cheap and good 
Alot of food to choose
Need more spread of healthy food
"Usually very hard to get a table.

Yes, there are many food stalls here but none of them is memorable or good for me to go.

In the mornings, the coffee stalls usually have very long and slow queues except for the Malay coffee stall."
"Ice kacang @ $2.80 . I'd rather eat at koufu, cheaper and nicer. No choice , hot weather, suck thumb."
"WORST HAWKER CENTRE IN SINGAPORE! Auntie cleaner is crazy and rude!!!!! She pushed her cleaning cart into a narrow space between my son's chair and another chair. She didn't even politely asked if he could move his chair in. She just pushed her cart till it touched my son's chair and expected him to move his chair in! Which he did! But unfortunately her cart was too near his chair which in turn made her cups on her cart fall down. But the design of the chair was terrible! It can even be moved properly and the legs of the chair bents out! And why must she stack her cups so high! In the end the crazy auntie cleaner scolded him in Chinese she said: Can't you move your chair inner!!!!!! She was so rude and dared to scold him when she was the one at fault for pushing her cart so near my son's chair! Can't she just ask politely! She deserves to be fired! How can NTUC Foodfare, a government organisation be so lousy at hiring staff!!! Insane! NTUC CAN'T YOU DO YOUR JOB PROPERLY! Auntie, doesn't mean you're a senior you can treat others badly! Treat others with respect! Don't think you're the top of the world!"
So far the worst hawker centre i visited. Expansive and below average foods from most stalls.
A very economical place to eat your meals.
"Came here for mee sua. There is a constant queue here for the food. The mee sua taste is good, and the bowl of food is enough for my lunch. Recommended."
"There are plenty of food options in Admiralty kampung. When I went there today to purchase dim sum, the queue was extremely long and the staff were using mental calculations instead of a calculator. As a result, they ended up miscounting the money, resulting in me paying extra to the stall. The service was unsatisfactory.

The food wasn't fully cooked too."
Hainanese chicken rice shop is good. Tasty chicken and the attendants are friendly.
Crowded during lunch hours
"The Malay drink stall helper has very terrible attitude. Shouted at me when I reminded her my order.  There was a guy standing beside me and he told me that the woman had a lot of complaints because of her attitude.
Seriously, I think the stall owner should reconsider hiring a staff like this cause her attitude is going to affect the business."
"Great place! A hwker on the 2nd floor and a few restraunts 1st floor. Many fun things to do here as well, a mini swamp for viewing and a big ground to ride skateboards and scooters here. Def coming back!"
"A kid puked on the floor, no one bothered to clean up.
I informed a Malay cleaner wearing RSPL uniform, said, ""that one not my job.. """
Nice hawker with typical hawker food
A must visit makan place for all things local and fair.
"A place built for retirees and other lay people with medical, supermarket and dining facilities. Could be a little boring to young people though."
I been at Kampung Admiralty for Healthier SG events last week.
I think this is the best hainanese chicken I've ever eat!! Seriously this is so cheap and. I bought only $5.50 all include vegie and dumpling. And this is halal certified!
lot of food varies. just lack of seating area
Terrible service ...the old man no manners like I owe him a lot of money...have a bad attitude.
"This is Chinese pancake shop.
This old man was like gangster. He couldn't calculate total amount correctly. when I let him know correct amount, he was angry and said, ""Don't eat lah!"" and throwed the balance.

Young boy (maybe looked his son) kept mentioned ""You will get elder and do wrong.""

You two think customers must respect this kind of elder? because of elders?Yi Lao Mai Lao. I and you meet as clerk and customer. Additionally, was I angry?

I am suggesting to this shop, IF YOU DONT HAVE HOSPITALBILITY, JUST GIVE OTHER OWNER HAVING WARM HOSPITALBILTY.
I hope NTUC give better option to Woodland residences rather than this kind of shop.

Be careful this shop and especially this elder."
"Out of nowhere I stumbled upon this Halal local Hawker Centre when I needed to enroute to another location in Woodland. Good varieties  of hawker food open from 7am to 10pm. Ample spacious seats n good ventilation as compared to older hawkers centers. 2nd level just next to the MRT, major supermarket n banks/ATM. My 3rd visit to have my hot dim sum breakfast $5 bucks. Pocket friendly plus you won't find this unique concept anywhere outside of Singapore."
A regular neighbourhood hawker fare....
We can taste quite a fare share of the singapore hawkers food here
"You can go around and probably get a meal below $3.00!

Wide variety of food ranging from porridge to soup to roti prata! A place where you'll be spoilt for choices. Do get ready for a huge crowd when you are there during lunch or dinner time, but it's just how a hawker Center is after all.

Enjoy the food here!"
"Try out Long Ding Zi Char

Price is reasonable and food also nice"
"Must say that this place still had it's charm for local residents, food easily available, with some shopping stuffs to purchase for last minutes usage."
"Na Bian De Shi Wu Bu Cuo De...Jie Qian Ye Ke Yi,Mei Ci Wo Qu Na Li Yi Ding Bi Dian(Jian Jiao Zi)Hen Hao Chi,Hui Bao Zhi.

"Had breakfast here one morning , many choices....bee hoon , fried carrot cake, pancakes, roti pata and other local breakfast.  Enjoy the open air atmosphere...airy with big fan on top ."
Dishonest fruit stall owner. Try to cheat my 6yo son who try to buy sugarcane juice. Very sickening act.
Must try ice milo here..
One of the better hawker centres that i have experience. Cleanliness and hygiene is very much maintained here. Perhaps only the birds flying around scrapping for leftover food is the only issue.
Great selection of food. Must try the Ah Ma mee sua
"I had Indian mee goreng, fried banana and ice kachang for dessert.
Enjoyed the food and the atmosphere of open air food court."
Open air concept
"generally a good spot for chill meal... lot of variety, vendors not very friendly though"
"Love  the food variety and the vibrancy here!
Non stop traffic and the price of food here is 

Too bad I was in a rush to grab my coffee, else I m going to try all the food from here!

Many stalls having long queues, drinks stall especially!

Heard that the stallholders here have not been changed much since it's opening. Guess the businesses here must be good and all hawkers here earning big bulk !"
Got plenty of local foods and dessert
A foody place where you spoil up for choices
Only like one or two particular stores
"A lot of food options, but hard to find seats."
Warm friendly Hawker family environment.
My food tasted nice real
Multi nationality food choices available here
"Living in the East, seldom do I get the chance to discover the northern part of Singapore. Would usually overshoot yo JB. Surprisingly, this place has a cluster of HALAL food and the atmosphere there is just astounding. Will go there again, soon, I hope.."
Hawker center with many food to choose from.
My regular eating place.
A cooling n cool place with good and great prices hawker food.
Food is reasonable
"The newly renovated Admiralty place , with it's about to be opened new airconned food court , is going to be linked to the hawker centre by a bridge. The arrangements of the shops here are excellent. Particularly enjoyed sitting around at the A&W restaurant sipping root beer and watch this beautiful world go by. For lunch, the healthy yong Tau hu stall at Admiralty place is my favorite."
Chinese noodles stall is good
The hawker centre has a lot of big fans on top to generate the air. Food wise is OK. Can use Paylah to make payment.
Worst ever mix rice stall charged $2 for the meat portion but yet all fats given. Really bad ethic doing business.
"After renovation, the hawker Center is now more spacious, windy and with more seats. Just next to Admiralty MRT.

Variety of foods and drinks. From Chinese, Malay, Indian, Thai and many more. There are Bakery , fruit stalls, fried banana, vegetarian and etc.

The yong tofu we ordered are made to order. Fried or soup. We ordered fried with mixed of Vegi and tofu.

Ordered the mala and green pepper grilled fish from San Yi Xuan

Payment could be cashless too, convenient

Nearby here have wet and dry market and also Prime supermarket"
Tbe only drawback is the lack of tables for dining in.
"Bought the $4.20 portion of prawn but was given the $3.00 quantity. Disappointed, not going to patronize again"
It's rather disappointing as the pork rib fried batter is soggy and the sauce is not tangy enough.
the kampung chicken rice stall near the escalator is SO good!  i always have this when im here.
"First time I came across a Niang Dou Fu stall when I place my order, the seller telling me they have other options but no Dou Fu,they NEVER sell any Dou Fu before."
The food here is nice and price is reasonable. However the cleanliness of this hawker centre is not that satisfying during peak hour. The used plates returning kiosk can be designed to let the customer return the plates easier.
"Wide variety of food. Malay chinese etc. Breezy sitting area. Sometimes have activities at the atrium on L1 n make it noisy at the kopitiam but it is still acceptable.

Food price us reasonable. The coffee booth offers one of the cheapest breakfast set of kopi + soft boiled eggs. Always long queue n it is with the wait. It actually moves quite fast too.

Right next to mrt so xan call friends to come over for a meal."
So many choices of food . Many typea of dessert and drinks stall too . Must visit for food lover .
Do try the Ayam Penyet at the stall called  Ayam Penyet (what else?) Crispy fried chicken leg accompanied by fried toufu and a totally sedap and pedas chilli sambal
long queue for drinks order.Never think ways to improve.
"07/11/2022 at 09:34, This type of dirty cup still can use to  save customers

29/03/23 at 19:00hrs, pls look into it, ur fork and spoon too oily

30/03/23 at 15:57, look at the table, want ppls clear the plate, but table don't clean, push a trolley walk here walk there talking."
Big and spacious... lots of choices
"Roast meat rice for 3 of us ..paid with CDC voucher, later rojak and some drinks..nice place and yummy food.."
Pathetic portion of you kee duck rice.. the duck was thinly sliced and only gave about 5 thin slices. Not worth the $4. Peanut also only gave 3.
Carpark entrance is an accident magnet
Food is not bad here 
"Cheap drink (from Malay store), good prata, good Malay fried rice, but some stalls might be a bit expensive tho....
There is a lor mee stall, but personally feel portion too small price too expensive.
The fried carrot cake is good, try the ""black + white"" plate.
Overall a good place to come for morning breakfast (aka prata!!)
P.s no picture as google map notification pop up after I finish and is drinking my teh taleh"
A great place to go to for lunch or dinner. Lotsa variety and great tasting food.
What is point offering pioneer n medeka card holder 10% discount when $3 meals are not entitled if so at least inform consumers if it defeat the purpose
After renovation the whole place glows and have more variety of choices of food now.
Foods here taste so so. Fishball noodles taste the most lousy.
Lotong here is nice.
Varieties of food and foods are much cheaper than bukit canberra hawker center.
Good place to have food all the time..
"Poor ventilation system.strong smell of cooking.

"
Lots of choices including grilled fish
"Ordered Laksa and BCM from this stall, the server were not so friendly. thats beside the point.
I am writing to suggest vendor or operator to be more hygenic when preparing food (Bowl, plates, spoon and forks).
refer to the pics i attached.

when i collect my ordered food, i realised that the spoon is dirty and unhygienic. so i went to the stall to show them, they pushes their responsibility to NTUC (which they verbally said), told me isnt their problem (tone of voice and gesture - very rude).

to me, it works two ways, the cleaner or washer including the operators, is a team effort and do not push away responsibility.

they really spoilt my morning and i am writing to request for more cleaner and hygenic food including making the society a better place to live in.

i hope the management read this and educate the operators."
Worst food court 
Love the food court on the second storey. Lots of good food here.
Spacious and we'll ventilated.
"Hawker centre is on the 2nd floor. High ceiling and many large ceiling fans to cool the area. There's yakun, coffeebean on the 1st/ground floor. There's a large foyer with seats for residents to sit and relax."
Great Food Choices
"Great, vegetarian food at good reasonable price and generous portion."
"Rude attitude to patron when trying to buy food! Both malay stalls give a look that makes customers feel unappreciated and awkward! Ask for extra chilli for the chicken rice is like asking for a pot of gold. Both Aunty from the Halal Stall spoke to each other, saying about me asking for extra chilli.

If this is how your stalls give service to customers, it will bring shame!!"
Only tried the popiah and the taste was just so so. Overall  the hawker centre is very airy and spacious.
Cannot recognise Admiralty as mostly new building. Great job Singapore  
"Wide variety of food. However, always had a hard time to find a table."
"This is a big hawker center, lots of stores selling delicious food with reasonable price.

Always crowded, got to go early or queue for a seat."
Good place for family
Bring your noise cancelling headphones...the crowd is really deafening during peak hours
"I was there around 11am on a Monday: Would have given 5 stars except many of the tables had not been wiped- mucky tables with yuky stains. Sigh ..not enough staff to wipe tables. But this place still has some endearing points: view of the huge plants gave one corner of the place, a Botanic Gardens feel - Yup! Pretty nice, with kopitiam prices:Kopi- C kosong costs me 80 cents.  Cheap & Good. Just bring own wet wipes to clean your Tables."
Very noisy and  strictly no  busking.
Coconut Shake Available. So good.
"Many food choices, but some patrons do not return their tray and keep the table clean. Bad habit dies hard. Most people return their utensils after the mandatory ruling comes out.  Kudos."
Drinks are cheap here. Only 80C/ for big cup of coffee. Delicious too.
"Nasi Panggang at Uncle Penyet is very good, better than Punggol's outlet.

Preserved veg with braised pork rice $3.80, very worth and tasty, full of flavours, would like it if the veg is more. (But the pork portion is generous enough)

Chicken soup with the orange mushroom I forgot what it's called, is very good, $6.50. Would like to try other soup very soon.

There's a place selling Congee and dry noodles. The Congee is edible, there's marination within the minced meat and soothing, good for cold weather. Prices not expensive, just not much variety in the Congee section (e.g. no fish) Would come again to see when I'm sick again.

Yukee Duck Rice is cheaper and more delicious than other outlet like Bishan Kim San Leng's. The rice and soup are very fragrant.

Bak kut teh is very good! Love the soup and even dabao home to keep. Braised pork is also very good, very homely.

Grilled fish is good, very fresh and portion is big.

Carrot cake is good too can try.

Prawn noodle so-so"
The worse cleaner service n lazy  never help to clean the tables 
"Vegetarian mixed rice available!
Delicious and many choices."
The price for keema at the North indian food stall is $5 plus with 2 naan $1.50each is $7.50. Ridiculous pricing. How to eat naan w/o keema?
This outlet Uncle Penyet really one kind. Staff is not friendly at all especially the chinese lady. They have the curry chicken set for $2.80 and they refused to sell it. Twice i came. Once was in the evening. They said it was finish. Ok fine maybe coz it was already late. Today i came again on a Thurs at 1230pm and again was told it was finish. How could it be finished when previously i patronized this store at 1030-11am they said the curry is not even ready to be served and i would normally wait. The irony of this was that there was a pot full of chicken curry brewing on the stove when she said it was finished. If you're going to sell a dish for that price then make sure you're sincere in doing so. This is the problem i find with some Malay stalls. Their reluctance and selfishness.
"Clean, spacious and with many good food."
"Good food, open air and well ventilated. Unfortunately the cleanliness gotta buck up."
"Nice, open and breezy. The high ceilings made sure that the air doesn't feel smoky or stuffy. Lots of nice food and being part of an elderly housing scheme (Kampung Admiralty), there are cheap offers for each stall ($2.80 at the time of writing). Do visit before 6.30pm for dinner as it gets pretty crowded after that.

Highly recommend the Bakuteh/pig stomach soup stall. And for our Muslim friends, the halal chicken rice which was excellent."
Is a fancy version of Fair Price foodcourt.
Plenty of food options. U will b spoilt for choice
Nice place for food..cheap and good.
Great place and great spread of food at pocket friendly prices. It has too much goodies..can't taste it all in 1 day will return to try other foods...had the Ayam Panggang today..sauce and chilli combo was just right..wishes there was more sauce and rice cuz I was really hungry at 2:30pm...hehe
Zhe Bian You Hen Duo Mei Shi. Mei Wei Ke Kou
Food is good but unfortunately the makcik at the drink stall is super rude. This is not the first time though. She need to learn to respect people.
"Bought take out food from caifan 'porridge' stall, and to my horror when I opened the packet at home I found a strand of short hair. Not the first bad experience with this stall, few months back went to buy food using CDC voucher but got rejected loudly by the staffs despite the voucher decal pasted on the counter. Would not recommend this stall."
"Porridge from this store called Xibei Wang is so so bland!!!! Thank goodness for the century egg inside. It was so hard to swallow I couldn't finish the food. I love porridge and I've had all sorts of porridge but this one is really something else. The porridge is the grainy kind (I know some people like it, but I prefer sticky soft porridge.) also, it was $4... and the lack of ingredients and flavours makes it not worth the money.

The store uncle was very nice, service is good but I'm sorry something needs to change about the taste of the porridge "
Good variety of food options and very spacious. But the lifts doesn't work well. Sometimes the lift doors doesn't close despite pressing the close button multiple times. Sometimes the lift arrive without a sound then the door will quickly close and go down to other levels.
"Bad experience with the Indian Muslim stall, on their menu beehoon goreng written was $3.50 but they have the audacity to charge $4.00, saying they just changed price. If you changed it, update, do not mislead customers or worse still act like scammers."
"Lots of variety of local food, almost long queue everywhere. Most of the Muslim food sold out at this ""Kampung"""
"Clean hawker centre with lots of variety, definitely everyone can find something they like"
The food is reasonably priced and good . Next to the mrt too
"Parking is easy and not pricy. A few fastfood joints, a supermarket, medical facility, cakes, food court at level 2. Can't ask for more especially when it connects to the MRT."
"The cleaner mark their territory of cleaning when ask to clean pretend not to hear till I got to shout very loud. Embarrassed then she came to clean. This is the type of return the tray downside spoilt by the government. It happens very commonly everywhere in coffee shops as well. Nobody go and tell the government their ""good"" ideas are not working? We don't get cleaner tables but in the midst of politics the aunties playing with each other at the coffee shops. Where are the cleaner tables they say .. looks like it's worse as workers exploit the system."
Great place
is ok. Kind of a challenge to get a seat during peak hour.

"Variety of food choices. Most of the stall is super long q. Maybe is becuz I went during lunch hour. I had visited a roasted chicken stall which the only stall no queue at all but the aunty attitude super bad, and the chicken rice is so so only. Will try other stall for the next round"
Many choice. Tested the lok mee not bad. The popiah is good !!!
Not bad. But closed by midnight
"Very Clean and friendly environment.
Food okay not bad.. Spacious and nice."
"Very very expensive then other hawker Center . The photo display Lor mee, full of the bowl, I fact only half of the bowl when serve."
"Naise, the western food very bo hua"
"Warm & nice broth for cooling morning
I especially love the hint of Chinese wine used."
This hawker center is a meeting place for elderly. They like to occupied here for coffee break from morning to afternoon. You will be hard pressed to find empty table during lunchtime. I suggest the coffee stores here offer discount after lunchtime so that there will more free tables available during lunch hours.
Everything normal the Mala food  stall Spicy Pot not bad esp the grill fish which is selling like HOT  CAKES!
A lot of choice and not very expensive. Food is nice. I love this very much. Not So salty and not too oily. Very delicious.
Went to buy vadai at the original vadai stall there. Best vadai 
Wide selection of Singapore hawker food. Prices are reasonable and do not appear to have been raised exorbitantly.
Easily accessible with handicapped  access.  Right in front of MRT and public transport stops.  With two supermarkets within reached and other neighborhood shops.  POSBank branch at basement and ATMs of all major banks are also available here.
Many food variety & most food are resonanably priced! Place is spacious and windy. Will come again!
"BUBUR CHA CHA, only sweet potato and yam! Not value for money at all, so much diff from the picture and price not cheap. Some aircon food court even better and more give ingredients. Bakery selling very expensive and not nice. Cakes are hard and dry..."
The bakery shop bread is expensive and not nice. The cake is hard and dry. Can't even swallow
"Lots of options, however not very cheap"
"The Kampong Admiralty Hawker Centre is conveniently located at the 2nd level of Kampong Admiralty just in front of the Admiralty mrt station. It has 43 foodstalls and seating capacity of 900 people. The price is also very reasonable. I like the high ceiling with large ventilation fans installed which provides good air circulation and it does not feels warm dining here. Every stall here are also fitted with proper exhaust venting system. However, there seems to be just 2 stalls selling drinks here which is clearly insufficient and you always need to queue really long just to get yourself a drink."
My worst food experience in porridge. Really tasted like nonsense. Will never ask anybody to buy from here.
Lots of variety of singapore hawker foods including the Halal ones. Beverages selling at very low prices.
Good service very friendly and helpful highly recommend Vetri
Open air hawker eatery. Limited seatings during peak periods. Great selection of food at fairly cheap prices. Ice coffee was abit of disappointment; hopefully was a one time event. Cashless payment available.
Not your typical SG hawker food stalls here which is great. Check out the Yong Tau Foo stall. Best in the north region dare I say.

"Great choices of food here and very reasonably priced. Although it's not Ir conditioned, it's quite well ventilated and have huge ceiling fans. The fish ball noodles and poh piah are delicious. Need to try others next time."

"Nice Mala shop, more Ma (numbing) than La (spicy), but price bit on the high side. For 2 pax (as picture) cost us $27."
Though no air cond ambience is good
I was surprised to find a new hawker center with food of excellent quality food. Prices are reasonable and a huge variety to choose from .  Local Chinese dishes and Malay favourites .  Gotta try it .I'll gi again for sure
"Wide selection of goodies to chose
Clean as you go too"
"A huge open sided hawker centre on the 2nd floor. Large variety  of F&B
Spoil for choice. Nice food.
Quite crowded even on weekday afternoon. Prize resonable"
The porridge and rice stall are very expensive compare to many coffee shop in woodland area.
"First time here. My friend said their ""ah ma"" Mian Xian is use to be very popular and long queue. So I tried it. And I would say it is alright, which something different from the usual foods. The standard of the taste may have drop according to my friend."
"Do not buy drinks for this stall. Drink is bland, coffee and tea are from a dispenser, non of them 'tarik'.
Feel so cheated buying my drinks from this stall."
Green banner on the corner of food centre are halal food
Delicious Laksa and Lor Mee
"Various varieties, nice food , airy open dining area"
"The design of this hawker Centre is futuristic, particularly the vents on top."
Many choices here but seats are quite limited due to SMMs for Covid. I love the spacious area.
Good place to eat many varieties
Enjoyed the Ayam Penyet. Freshly fried & reasonable price
"Nice eatery place with variety of food! Value for money, generous portion."
Table no clean. Cut cost for not hiring people to collect used plate and folk spoon. Yet table is freaking dirty. Good job ntuc

"Pretty decent hawker fare. Very crowded though, alot of the time. Weekends are especially crowded with families."
Superb place for all eateries n groceries needs...
Food is good but slightly expensive
Mushroom soup is mediocre
"As usual as what l mentioned b4 that Kmpg Admty Hwkr probably serves various types of foods, beverages,  fruits juices & so on...The best that anyone can dine in  or take away ( Y not try it out/ now nor anytime."
"Food centre is airy, spacious and choices of food. Must go try."
Rude table cleaner. Tall old man. Called people stupid.
Nice chendol
"Patronized the Mala store alot. However, the portion is getting significantly lesser these days. Food are generally nice and have variety. Seats are hard to find."
"It's nice there, comfy. Though I just went there for my medical appt. i find that it's a place whereby u can find assorted items."
Variety of food for everyone! From vegetarian to halal food and even chinese mixed rice! But what I love the most is the onion prata. So crispy and amazing 
Day & Night Herbal Soup is really good. Better than many soup stalls elsewhere. Soup is clear with a strong herbal base taste.
"You must not miss the mixed vegetable rice stall, which also provide Teochew porridge with many dishes for you to select. Spend only less than $10 to enjoy 4 to 5 dishes with hot porridge. There are also many other local delight food stalls for you to select. High ceiling eating place, with huge ceiling fans, make the sitting environment breezy & cool to enjoy your food there."
"Clean, airy and good ambience food centre. A huge variety of food. Favourites are mala xiang guo and yong tau foo."
"lots of coffee-shop chit-chat and beer drinkers hogging tables, especially when they refuse to budge until the hawker center closes."
The fried fish soup is tasteless from Xian Fu Fish Soup stall. Avoid if possible.
This hawker center has all kind of food. Recommended for group people wanting to eat from different types of dishes.
Lots of good food!
"Hygeine bad, cleaning no good .staff problem, need improve"
"Food wise has wide varieties including Amah Mee-Suah soup which contain pork balls meat plus lever & big chinese mushrooms .
With $2.60 u can enjoy tasty traditional Loh Mee.Other delicious dishes prawn mee, roasted pork, iron-plated fish ,vege meals. There r 2 chinese  cuisines stalls  econ rice/porridge to choose from.
As for the baverages i always love their tea mix coffee (YinYang) hot .very special taste indeed."
Food quality so so. Hot beverage quality so so. Better to go to marsiling mall FC or marsiling lane FC.
"Kampung Admiralty offers a wide variety of food that will meet your every need. It is located just outside the Admiralty MRT station and is on the second floor. There's such a wide range that they even have two drinks stall to choose from! Personally prefer getting food from the Chicken Rice Stall, the Chinese Stall (mala and other mainland dishes), as well as the Muslim Western stall. Should these not satiate you, there are more food options available all around Kampung too!"
"Cheapest 80cents coffee c and 70cents coffee o, both cups compare still cheaper than S11 coffee shop at marsiling block 304, coffee c cost $1.60 per cup. It could be the most expensive coffee among woodlands and Marsiling estate."
"Clean, very cooling, nice variety.
A bit pricey for heartland food, although you should go into this with the mindset that rental is probably high and the price is the price as going to eat in an aircon kopitiam (even if it isn't one)"
Mee robust is nice.Chinese uncle and aunty near drink store in Kampung food centre at Admiralty MRT.And the price is $2.80.
Sizeable hawker centre with a good number of stalls selling a wide range of both halal and non-halal food varieties. Cool place to spend time during and outside meal time.
Foods best

Pleasant eating environment

Good place but avoid peak period hence there is no place to sit.
Good choices of Malay food here
"Nice spacious place with wide walkways. Normal hawker prices.
One Ah Mee Sia is generous with their ingredients at $4 per bowl."
Good place for food and also medical center
The large variety of options (halal and non-halal) available means there's always something for everyone. 
"Spacious hawker centre with varieties of food to choose from, the teh C is only 90 cents!"
I like it here because it's the best hawker center I never met

Probably the worst salted egg chicken I ever tasted . From Long Ding seafood
"Wu Zhang Ai Tong Dao,Xia Yu Tian Ya Lin Bu Liao Yu. "
The only place that sells Lempeng Kelapa..a coconut pancake with sambal chili.
"Wide variety choices of food.  However, seats are very limited and difficult to find a table, especially during Phase 3 HA."
"The china lady at this stall is so rude and only know to scold you without listen your order.
Never come back to this stall even i starve to death."
"Cleanliness is good! Food wise so-so. However, love the Tau Suan!"
"Must try! ""Lontong"" (Malay Rice Cakes in Vegetable Curry) at Old Times Stall at Kampung Admiralty is wonderful. It has abalanced taste of spiciness, saltiness, sweetness. Also you can sense that the gravy is well prepared, it has a fine anchovies inside. Will come back again. 5 stars."
A lot of food choices.
The only nasi padang stall there with the reasonable price in the whole of Singapore. 5stars ratings
Good place to have local food...
Very nice place..not crowded.
Clean eating place. Very inviting...with lots of wonderful varieties...
Sell alot of nice foods.
Best food in Kampong
A well run centre! Keep it up.
"Food selection is good, I would rate many of the food stalls here 5 stars easily. However the table/seating layout and arrangement is weird and seems I would put it as inefficient seating. For such a modern and large hawker center, which could have easily accommodate larger crowds, have such restricted table designs."
I am most impressed by the selection of dishes at the Chinese mixed rice food stall. The selection of Muslim food is quite decent too. I can get almost everything I am craving for here. Well done on the variety and selection of hawkers!
Chicken rice best
"Generally a over-priced hawker centre with a wide variety of choices.
Apart from one or two standout stalls, the quality of the food served is poor and portions are small, yet at above average prices. Go to other nearby coffee shops to grab a bite."
"Dont go during ""Peak Hours"" sure cannot find seat. However the food are very good. There were equal varieties of Halal and Non Halal stalls.
I always buy and tapao. NEA need to impose a fine for those who dont clear their trays and clean tables. There are signs Self Clearing  still diners stubborn."
Xi Huan Na Li De Mei Shi He Huan Jing 
"Too crowded.
People use tissue reserve seats."
"Have India , Malay and Chinese foods but problems is not enough seats to go round food reasonable good"
"Not easy to find seats. Tables are not cleared, and hot during lunch"
Some stall food is cheap.but cleanliness of area needs improvement.do not expose soil food.
Great place
"The place is big, with large variety of servings.  It's the best of both worlds as they have a good selection serving the Muslim community.

Due to covid19, some seats are blocked. The place will definitely be crowded during lunch hour as it's housed in the same building as the Admiralty Medical Center."
"Stalls comes with lots of variety foods.
Individual taste of choice but do mind the extra $$ pricing."
"Spacious and Variety of choices~ favorite pancake, mee sua, loh mee, mala xiang guo are nice~ char kuey tiao standard not consistent, sometimes very nice, sometimes light taste..."
Nasi ayam has power sambal.. nice.. but must say if you want the soup.. if not they don't give
"One of my favorite hawker centres. Here, I tend to eat malay food. I like the fish and ikan billis nasi lemak, $2.80. The mutton briyani at $6.50 is also my favourite. The long grain rice is fluffy and filled with the aroma of spices. However, you will only get four little pieces of mutton, something like the size of a majong cube, or smaller. It's a dum briyani. So I asked for mutton gravy instead of the usual dal."
Various food to choose and.delicious too
Fabulous choice of food
A lot a lot a lot of people
So so mass
"Zai Gou Wu Zhong Xin Lou Shang Zhong Da Shu Shi Bu Rong Yi De,Yin Wei Da Shu De Gen Hui Ba Wu Ding Nong Lie Zao Cheng Lou Shui. Huan You Feng Chui Yu Da Hui Bu Hui Zao Cheng Shu Dao Xia Wei Hai Ju Min. Ru Guo Mei You Yi Ding De Ji Shu Shi Zuo Bu Dao De. "

Luv the new sua stall.
"Spacious, well aerated , affordable and nice food"
"One of the best hawker centres in Singapore. Clean, spacious, well ventilated, plenty of cheap and good food and conveniently located near MRT station. Parking lots are aplenty in a nearby basement carpark. Most popular are the Ah Ma Mee Sua, Traditional Lor Mee and My Kampung chicken rice."
"Food so so only but the price is slightly above hawker centres. If it is as a retiree kampung, then it must be a slightly high end for my seniors at home."
Very open and windy place to dine where tables are well spaced out. Certain food are very affordable. I find the Malay & Indian food to be very expensive unfortunately. Sad!
Variety of choice. Healthy options too.
A very small and good neighborhood centre... Convenience and link to MRT..
I happened to be ther with my wife I order a drink from the cool drink store he say can't change we up set 're order very rude people
I like the mee suan. The Hakka liang tou foo is really good. Like home cook food. Very comforting. Go try.
Can hardly find a table during peak periods
Food is mediocre
"Nice, cheap food! They hv the usual local fares. Plus an Indian stall that sells chapati & naan. The keema, power! Spicy & portion is not tiny. Best! But be warned, seating is v difficult. Even on a weekday!"
Food is sub-par and not cheap.

And a few good stalls selling delicious food."
Nice and delicious food i ever eaten! U people should try some too!
Very good variety of local food fare at affordable prices. A must try for anyone to have good halal certified dishes
Clean and spacious place...
Great Hawker Food and Great Fares to fill our stomachs at Kampong Admiralty Hawker Centre.
"Do not use the plus! Card as a form of payment. Most stalls do not support it any longer despite being encouraged by the posters and kiosks. They prefer cash payment.

Update (23 Jan 2020) - avoid the fruit juice store, the pricing is inconsistent and you might overcharged."
"Food is reasonably priced, though it can be better : satays came burnt at the sides and cereal prawns were getting cold already when served."
a little hard to find seats on peak hours.
Great choices of food at reasonable prices. Cooling.
food selection is good... nice airy environment.
Clean and provides good food
Loves the mixes
Is on the 2nd floor
Many stalls with much varieties of food to choose from.... Sometimes it is also a problem with too many choices that you are also lost in choosing what to eat.
3.50 chicken rice is

Great and affordable food court

Clean & spacious with good food
Great place and great ambience
"Affordable price food. But drinks were a let down, ie poor taste milk tea"
"Many varieties of foods, drinks, titbits and fast foods. All the times are busy with humans traffic & if you are unlucky, you cannot get a sit because of very reasonable price were the other places cannot beat the price."
The hidden cup
Big Ceiling Fans
Alots of variety food
Best fish head asam pedas I had so far..
"Nice spacious and well ventilated hawker centre. They have a good selection of food choices there.   Some of the stalls seems more popular such as the Chinese nasi lemak stall, the ah ma mee sua stall and the tong fong fatt chicken rice (pictured). The economic rice stall have a wide selection of dishes. the hawker centre also have mala hotpot, herbal soup, Korean food, Muslim food, porridge, roasted meat and etc. Will go again to try the other stalls."
Not every store provide discount for NTUC member. Overall many selection of food
"Very things fine and , except lift slow and not responsive."
Nice big fans
Airy and spacious with lots of variety.
"At lunch or dinner timing, there are too many people. Food sold, i think is a little higher price and slightly above average only."
Good ventilation with high roof & giant fans. Tables are space far apart for easy movements- unlike Bukit Timah food centre's crammed space.
Love the chicken rice and dessert only
Good range of food
Good place to go with family..
"Huan Jing Bu Cuo,Hao Chi De Mei Shi Hen Shao. . . "
A lot of people at night n on weekends. No place to sit. Events happenings still cannot show on internet or Facebook. Food average at hawker except for kumpung chicken rice above average. Chinese western stall very salty - be aware as u will need a lot of water.
Quality and quantity of food has gone downwards. Perhaps it's because there is no competition as the other food court is closed due to massive rebuilding at the next block. Given a choice I'll eat elsewhere.
"Got the shock of our lives when we found this in our food. Was bought from the Mala stall 676 which always have long queues. The food is good but we rather stay healthy. It's not the first time we're eating here, but definitely the last."
Nice hawker Center. I think better than the one at Bukit Panjang.
"Lots of food choices, fast food and hawkers. 6 lifts to serve the people is awesome as the lift does not get too overcrowded. One stop do all places. Very nice."
The char kway teow and carrot is cheap and good. The food there are decent but the vegetables stall is definitely a little pricey.
Behind Admiralty MRT
Signature egg tarts are lovely!
"Spacious, airy and clean. The Halal chicken rice is relatively cheap and good."
Ok good and cleaned
Spoilt with choices. Wow!
Kong Qi Hao Feng Shan Hao Di Fang Qing Ji
I always eating my breakfast here
Its a food paradise
Like e wide varieties of food choice. Only let down are  the 2 drinks stall which were very slow. They should have more stalls.
Very creamy and affordable Teh Peng at $1.10! Please maintain the affordable price! FairPrice Foodfare FTW!!!
More varieties of food stalls. Nice environment.  Good taste for foods.
Very cheap and teastful.
nice place to eat goreng pisang..
"Slow service, rude staff."
Nice and inexpensive food
God food (halal) clean varuety of choices
Only have one escalator. Movements of people would be more convenient and efficient had there be two escalators. One for up and one for down.
Nice  food
"NTUC manage the place, but food are not cheap if you compare the portion they give. The foods there ok . But the chinese chicken rice stall is not honest. Esp when you order half chicken. They will change your chicken parts away. If you don't mind,  the $9 for half chicken (small) is ok.
The mix rice too. Worst mix rice stall in SG.
As for roti pasta,  nice and price reasonable.
One of the Malay stall curry puffs nice and cheap.. only stall that sell."
"Two retail shopping marts, fast food outlets, 1 hawker centre, 1 food fare and plenty of shops. Nice place."
Food quite nice
Didnt go up to the Hawker place but was surprised to see an Urgent Care centre for those needing medical attention.
"Good variety of food. Unfortunately only one escalator going up or down. I am above 62, knees a bit weak. Lifts are more for disabled or more elderlies. Thanks."
"Lovely airy hawker centre with lots of sunlight. You will be spoilt for choice here as there is an abundance of shops to choose from, all of which have interesting offerings.

This is the sausage and mushroom bamboo rice ($3.50). It appears to be a meal fit for a monastery, but each ingredient is packed with flavor."
Gd to find are food dare
"Ok ,A lots food choice.NTUC supermart at B1 now open 24 hrs comes in handy to shop. I would appreciate for cheaper price.I bellive it can lower prices so more customers can look for better prices.
Thanks,Charles"
Clean and nice

This place is absolutely convenient with the MRT station being just right beside. You get can your food fix there right away.
"Lots of food choices, great location at mrt. Set back is that it's really crowded that hardly any safe distancing between tables."
"All time favourite eating place with the family. Been a patron since old woodland.
They have a few outlets. But this one is still the best. The authentic taste since 10 years back.

Atmosphere is nice.

"The Kampong Admiralty Food fare is open air, big n breezy .  Many good foodstalls, hygienic, good value n my favourites are the Kway chup, mee n beehoon Soto, Tauhu Goreng n the Thai zi char stall.
Also popular is a rice stall that boasts great variety but it can be rather expensive.  Better value is the Ah Ma Mee Sua n the popular Lor Mee/Prawn noodle soup stall.
Food aside, I like the airy free seating on the grd level; good to relax cos not so noisy."

Good variety of food. Tried the fishball noodles today and I must admit that it was the worst fishball I had in my life.
Quite a number of stalls that are required to sell $2.80 either not eatable or they ALWAYS  SOLD OUT from morning to stall closed???

Relatively not a new place..but has a variety of food to eat.
Many choice of foods available
Too crowded.
One of the best lor Mee and Prawn noodles in North. Tips add on traditional Wu Xiang prefect 
New type of hawker stall - spacious and made breezy by the giant ceiling fans. Food variety is good but seating capacity was insufficient made worse by the alternate seating due to the pandemic.
"Good, clean place to eat n dine!."
Have lots of variety of food.
"typical food court in Singapore, where you can be a civilized human being that clean your own dishes after having your meal, but i see many barbarians spitting piles of bones on the table and make the whole place in such a disgusting mess"
Nice food-- San Yi Xuan soup and Kao Yu. 
"The food is common
Uncle and auntie not friendly in the front line.
Maybe they should do more promotion on the food to convince people to buy more.And be more sweet to the customers."
Good withvarious food courts
Lots of variety ! Like the Yong Tau Foo and    Wanton Noodle!

Cheap food and nice environment
Many variety of great hawker food. Choices of nice restaurants too. Also a supermarket to buy your necessity and grocery after u hv a good satisfying meals. Surrounding is placed with Smart Bins. The cleaning coy is embracing Technologies to improve their work. But regret that the cleaning did not deployed Smart Toilet System to improve their work flow and the hygiene standard. Though toilet r clean but still the smell was noticeable.
"Kalian harus coba chicken rice di sana, karena enak dan halal."
Very convenient to going there find food and basic nasasary item for community gathering
"This place has high human traffic and a large amount of food outlets. There are many variety of food offered here. This place is like many food court around the island. I had a great time here as the food here is really tasty. It is also very accessible for the people in the Admiralty neighbourhood. It is located near the admirably MRT station and that it is not far from the residential units. Overall, a nice food court in the north of Singapore."
"It is the bustling hawker centre we almost head down to try some of these dishes and were taken aback by the plethora of food choices that they had to offer. The hawker centre is ginormous, well ventilated, bright and cheery."
Cheap affordable food for the mass
Nothing much to eat
"Very nice, delicious  Muslim Cuisine"
Limited seats n tables but it is located at the 2nd lvl with high ceiling and better ventilation.
"Smaller and w fewer stalls than traditional centres, but with a more spacious and airy layout"
Ok good variety of food but difficult to find seats during peak periods (dinner time). Both drinks stall there have limited selections of beverages unfortunately.
Lots to choose
Nice Place with plenty of good food
Wide variety of affordable food in an airy and spacious hawker centre.

"There are noodle, soup, cakes and breads as well as nasi  lemak and fried bee hoon and dim sum. Many people like to come with friends and family to have breakfast and talk about the daily life and happening."
Love it. Especially I like malar.
Many choices for Muslim food on the 2nd level of Kampung Admiralty. Its the hawker centre. Reasonable price for the food.
Huge place. Not Air conditioned but it's fine. Plenty of food and drinks to choose from.
A lot of variety
"Great variety of food and a few quite nice,  carrot cake, lor mee and tan yu"
This hawker centre is spacious and clean with a high ceiling.  The food sold is affordably priced and of varieties.  Highly recommended.

Various makan options!
"Nice food, a lot of variety and price reasonable"
So many options. Clean hawker centre.
"You can find lots of choices like Chinese, Western, Indian, Malay, Vegetarian, dessert stalls etc..Worth to make a trip down. It's located just next to Admiralty Mrt, turn right after you exit from the control station and turn left when you see 7-eleven. You should see it a building at your right and take a lift beside Long John Silver. Enjoy  your meals."
Awesome variety and reasonably priced
Decent place to eat with Huge variety. Very clean as well but theres only one drink stall so the queue is quite long
"Spacious, lot of varieties, price is reasonable, good ventilation and windy. Lok mee and the ah ma mee sua are among the best"
Plenty of good food.
"Many people, got variaties choices but not really cheap."

"Tried Ah Mah mee sua. Broth was good, mee sua was excellent."
Quite expensive for nasi padang food
"Best roti prata,nasi ayam,nasi campur,alot of penyet too"
It's affordable and tasty

Ordered Yu Kee duck rice for $2.80 but nv expect the portion is so little.. less than half a bowl of rice.  . So I change to set meal tho I just want the duck rice.
A lot of delicacy food to enjoy
"Lot of goodies, reasonable price."
"Many of the types of food are nice to eat, eg one yong dou fu stall run by a lady has pretty good yong dou fu. The yong dou fu at the stall reminds me of one ydf retaurant at sembawang."

Newly built hawker center centre which is spacious windy and with natural ambiance

Excellent and cheap food!
Run By NTUC kinda pricey and the porting ain't that much for a big eater like me sadly :(
"Reasonable and generous portion for the mixed rice, with many options to choose from. Food is served hot and flavourful."
Spacious and airy. A lot of good food.
Lots of varieties of food.
"Great food, odd tables."
"Carrot cakes, toast and many delicious foods"
"It doesn't have a lot of fancy food but it has good quality average meals, meals that you kinda eat on a daily basis. Well excluding maybe the western food stall which boasts pasta and fish N chips It is a food court after all. If you do visit this place, try the shaved ice deserts, they are my favourite. There are a few pigeons and crows here and there but they never got too close to you. Some famous stalls here like the father and sons (their carrot cake is delicious and they are generally very friendly people). The main stall here is probably the chicken rice cause it's cheap (2.80) and delicious"
"Convenient,  Good environment "
Many varieties of food.  Price reasonable
Spacious n unique hawker centre sell variety of local food at reasonable price recommends for travellers

Lots of food
"This a nice hawker centre. 5stars.
But when you want to buy coffee...zero star!!!
It can be a good hawker centre, however beverage part very let down. Only one to choose from. So it is actually not hawker anymore, it is kopitiam. Letting someone Monopoly beverage department, make long queue for just a below average kopi or tea. No no to this! Please allow more beverages stall.
Right now I always go ah kun at below for coffee.

Although this hawker is new, the cleanliness is poorer than most of the hawker. Many plates left on table. Hard to find a clean table.

I WILL TRY TO AVOID FOODFARE UNLESS NO OTHER CHOICES. THE WORST IN Singapore"
Variety of food is many. Place is a bit dirty but still okay!
Got more options for halal food. I enjoyed
Food is ok but less vareity.
Okay but very crowded
Need more seating
Good place to eat and chill.
"It  is quite a busy food Court. You can find a few famous food stalls in this place. But seats are limited. You have to ""chop"""
"Good place to eat. Many stalls to choose from. Muslim, Indian and Chinese food available here. This place is not airconditioned,  it has gigantic fans that keep the place cool and comfortable.
The lor mee is good, most times there is a queue. This lor mee stalls also sells good prawn mee and laksa. Request to pack soup separately for takeaways, orders have to be minimum $4. The chicken rice there is good too. The coffee and tea sold here are cheaper than other places.
Bought duck noodle soup on three different occasions from the kway chap stall, told the man at the cash register who collects payments and takes orders that I wanted soup. Even with reminders, I was given the dry version on all three occasions. Not buying from this stall any more.
Went there recently on a weekend to have lunch. Was unable to find a table as the ones that were not occupied had uncleared dishes and tissues left behind by earlier patrons. Although this place is a self return tray hawker centre, not people cleared their tables when they leave. The worst part is that the cleaners will not want to clear the tables when they push their dish collecting trolleys past these tables. And when you approach them to clear the table, they always have an excuse."
Food price reasonable
Liked the Yong Tau foo
Spacious and breezy
Great foods
"If you want cheap coffee this is the place, only $0.80. Have 2 stalls selling coffee, one is Chinese stall another is halal stalls.  Both always Long queue from early morning to late evening but the queue clear up very fast thanks to the aunty at both stalls. Like many other places here also hv variety of food, ample seat and airy environment. No aircond but huge ceiling fans around."
Not bad... a lot of food to choose from. Will go there again to try others
Wonderful variety of food at a reasonable price.
Very delectable delicious wide variety of local 'kampong' food you cannot find elsewhere even in Geylang. Should try the tasty lempeng dip in sambal. Huge lopes. All considerately priced.
"Average stalls, with some bad (Chinese economic rice stall - very rude and subpar taste) and some very good (Halal chicken rice stall). Prices are decently cheap. And kudos to the cleaners, they are prompt in the cleaning of tables."
Lots of food choices.  Coffee cheaper than most places.
I love chicken rice here !!!!!
Foods and shopping ctr
Nice selection of foods and ambiance.. windy and spaces ..
Near my home and Great Selection of food
Alot of Halal eateries to choose from. The chicken rice stall was a hit. Banana fritters was one of the best too.

Varieties of food.
"Very big and spacious,lots of food stall to choose from Western and asian"
huge variety of food to choose from and most of them is delicuous
Good spread of stalls to choose with 2 drinks stall.. open air concept and too little seats for the size
"Some good and some bad food. Some bosses ""tan-gao-liao"" Zhuan Gou Liao feel want to open stall as wish anytime they like."
It is very big with lots of good food. Just that recently the dish washing place have a slight odour.
"Cheap and affordable food, wide variety of drinks and food choices as well."
Here offers much wider variety of food options (Halal n Non-Halal) compared to nearby NTUC Foodfair @ Admiralty (located above Guardian). Open space dining concept with big fans. Chairs n Stools are surprisingly lesser now compared to initial openings.

"Very spacious, got wide food varieties to choose & good value for money"
"Management better check with others restaurants. Large size is not true. Fish, hotplate beancurd portion is very small if compared to Jiak. Expensive some more."
Aggressively average food but some decent stalls. Don't eat from San Yi Xuan: worst of the 3 stalls for Kao Yu $18 is cheap with lots of veggies but so blah tasting. Has no queue for a reason.
Good place & cheaper
"'porridge' stall which sells mixed rice with two CHINA lady helpers are so extremely rude! One of them raised her voice while serving an elderly lady n told her 'Be quick, I am not free!' but hey there are only two or three people queuing! I advised her to be more polite and she rebutted me! Come on, u r not at your hometown. Better be more respectful!"
Got nice food hawker.
"Got hawker, Ntuc, Posb and nice roof garden."
Both the tables and toilet are rather dirty.
"Shou Wan Die De Di Fang,Hen Luan Bu Wei Sheng"

Cheap place with variety. Hope to see more of these initiatives in Singapore
Great place
Run by food fare. Prices start from $2.80. Must try if nearby
"Great foodcourt overall, pretty clean, decent food choices and cheap coffee."
Most of the outlets close early by 8.30pm to 9pm even on Friday weekends...suggest to have the outlets open until midnight during weekends
Horrible food.
It's a food mall
"Love the mala, duck rice and soursop dessert from this place :))"
Tis place is getting from bad to worse. Very few cleaners are deployed to clear the tables. Returned plates & bowls were stacked up so high wif no one to wash them esp. in the halal-food section. Puts me off. Is tis food center run by NTUC?
Variety of food selections at a affordable price
"Nice well ventilated food centre with a high ceiling and mega sized fans. Lots of seats available and close to the MRT station

Variety of food is good and like most food centres in Singapore pretty good."
Cozy...great service....gd food value for money...ez access..
Breakfast is good... Gets crowded at noon and evening
Food are cheap
always here for the butter chicken naan & ayam penyet 
"Popiah is terrible, with or without chilli. No taste, and you cannot even find a taste of popiah in the ingredients. I hope they improve this dish because I love popiah (but not picky over it)."
There are various type of food but it's taste so so only
Top notch restaurants and hawker center
Family favourite for friday dinner
Great place to have meals!! Have a great variety and affordable! It's not hot in the afternoon although it's not air conditioned
Lots of good food available here to try.
Conveniently located nxt to MRT Stn n Market. Choice of food aplenty..
Nice family atmosphere
I would've said it was great but unfortunayely today when I took away a chicken chop from the western stall and found a nail in the food . Very disgusted and would not visit the western stall as it is very unhygienic
Amazing greeny area
My regular place for chicken rice and mala xiang guo. Spacious but usually crowded when lunch and dinner time.
The Siam Kia Thai Cuisine food excellent.
"Great place to have a meal with friends and family. With a high ceiling, the place is cool and airy. Wide choice of food!"
Place is big and food are good. Lack space and no rack for customer to put dirty plates. Need to do better job in keeping the place look clean.
"It is located at the 2nd floor of the Kampung Admiralty, which is very convenient for the elderly residents living in that block. Outsiders are also allowed to dine there. It is outdoor."
Cheap nice food
Convenient place to shop.
A very big and well ventilated hawker center with many stalls.
"My votes go to:
1. Boon tong kee chicken rice (nice chilli and chicken meat is flavourful)
2. Yong tau foo spinach soup (can't remember stall name but the one where you don't get to choose the items)
3. Mala stall (it's pretty acceptable)
4. Pork liver mian xian (I really like the soup, you can ask to exclude the liver)
5. Lor mee (just next to 4)
6. Father son fried carrot cake (go for black and white version)"
I love Asia Ghani Chicken Rice taste delicious n price reasonable. Will recommend this to anyone friends.
Many choices of food to choose from. But that doesn't mean all food are nice. :)
Variety of food
The food is good.
Nice food and affordable price
"Alot of food there but quite expensive. Selective stall food is nice others, so so only"
Toilet please at level 2. Rather then the main one ONLY at LVL 1
Its a no aircon big food place with lots of different stalls.
"This place is lively during day and night. It has been built with the ease and convenience of senior citizens in mind. Everything is within walking distance from hawker stalls, wet market, supermarkets, Starbucks, MOS Burger, Long John Silver, Ya Kun, H&L Life, Chaiteraise Pastry and more.  Weekly exercise classes are offered here at designated days of the week. There are many other convenient shops, medical centre, tailor and even. Medical centre upstairs. There is a large lounge area to chill while enjoying the cool breeze or just simply people watching."
Straight forward solid hawker makan here. Thank you for keeping this hawker tradition alive to all business owners at Kampong Admiralty Hawker Centre. Cheers!!
The food is nice got alot of my favourite food there but I went to 4 stalls to buy food only 2 stalls operator is quite good but no smile and others is even worse.... So still thinking want to give up this foods hunt??

"Sometime not so clean , need to clean yourself."
I had patronised a number of stalls at Admiralty Hawker Centre but it was Ah Ma Mee Sua stall that I would not want to give a miss unless I didn't have the time to wait in the queue. That was a couple of years back when everything was new and food had to be sampled. Now the crowd was not that forbidding and the queue not that discouraging. I could now have my. mee sua or the sheng mein in good time. The service too was now better. If you have not tried either the mee sua or the sheng mein you are encouraged to try them.
Good variety
"Nice place....everything is here...hawker,supermarket,restaurant,fastfood,mrt etc..."
Good place for lunch
Little to choose from
"Best food all here, wide variety to choose from as well"
Clean environment. Good choice of Halal Muslim food with good variety. Just behind Admiralty MRT station.
"Good choice and variety of food available. Can try the Fishball noodles, Ah Ma Mee Suah and Chicken Rice. The tray and cutlery collection point needs improvement though. The points always seemed choked with lots of cutlery and used plates.  Cutlery washing is also to be looked into as it is common to find food bits stuck to the washed cutlery which is quite a turn off."
there are so many stall that you can choose.  spacious
"Love it. Personal favourite ""ah ma mee sua"" is there, my go to when i want a soupy dish. The lor mee is really good as well."
Many halal food options! Location is very convenient too - just next to the mrt station.
The food and hot beverages price are normal but rojak cost $3.50 and poh piah cost $1.70 are quite expensive.
Bad  food taste.
Good variety of halal food here.
Place is bright and airy! Love the bak kut teh stall! Good service and good food too!
Various Singapore street cuisines
Good varieties of Malay Kueh Kueh.
Lots of food for selections. There is always something that suit each person. After that all can gather at any one table an saviour the food.
Food at reasonable price.
"3stars for the place as it is spacious n clean but can get a little warm at time... We had the San Yi Xuan sour soup fish ($18) which so-so not as what they rave bout. Do not need to come here for that. N the ""father & son"" carrot cake is soooo overrated, it is not up to the expected of carrot cake standard... So much so of giving up a ""high flying job"" n a ""muscular body"" to rave up the sales? !? !! Advise is go back to your day job will be a better idea..."
"Many stalls with good food... Love the mee sua, Rou Bing Fan,Cai Tou Guo,and dimsum...Downside is the very limited seating.."

Like the foods and the stall

The chilli fish is so so. The beancurd stick is not soft enough.
Wide eatery with varieties of food! Love the lor mee and the mala fish. Very generous portion that can feed 3 people. Do come early to avoid crowds!

"Do something about it!! Work on some synergy and strategy to accommodate the importance of food safety and cleanliness, eg : Table cleanliness wasn't keeping clean. We can't rely on the individual in keeping it clean from other than appointed cleaning resource to clean it up. Food hygiene was bad and unacceptable. Flies are everywhere land on most of every table."
"Lot of food variety, quite spacious"
Have a number of interesting stalls and food! The fried yong tou foo was freshly made upon order. The fish dish was generous and delicious. Very good for sharing and value for money!
Always difficult to find a Seat.

"People seldom clean their own plates because I guess they are lazy and self-entitled. Lot of people eat with their mouths open, like 4 year olds. Food okay apart from one of the Chinese outlets that seems to think sticking 12 garlic cloves in their food constitutes good cooking..."
Good selection of halal food.

Chinese rice and dishes is a scam. Bad service. Serves their own China people first before Singaporean even though we were in the queue first. Bought a steam grouper for $5. The fish was not even fresh at all.
Both the rice as well as their porridge was cold. Dishes were cold as well."
Near home. Celebrates our daughter's anniversary.
"The hawker center is big and it offers variety of food choices which includes Malay, Chinese, Thai cuisines. The place can get quite crowded during peak hours. The escalator leading up to the hawkers center change direction every month which I think might be inconvenient to the elderly. The ""man zhang kuey"" is a must to try!  The stall was previously at Block 166 Woodlands St, near Marsiling MRT."
Coffee is cheap

Dont give time for us to think awhile what to drink... sometime people cant make up their mind on the spot...anyway there was no long queue at all..., another one was the food sold out so fast and it was only 10am , come on, cook a bit more, if the dishes has finished then say , not available..."
Yummy foods with reasonable prices. Planning to fix it as my regular spot

"Kampung Admiralty is a venue where variety of cooked foods could be found here especially the Malay, Chinese and Indian cuisines is concerned . The Malay stalls in particular originally were quite legendary from the old Lorong Fatimah road side Warong in Woodlands Road near the Causeway. It seems the legendary Goreng Pisang Stall had move in to this new multi Community building housing a residential for Seniors, Medical Institutions and local eateries/Hawker stalls ."
Many elderly patronise the hawker as ia near to elderly cluster. However long queue always formed at only one nice beverage stall. Thwle other Halal drink stall served diluted coffee which explained  why no queue. Need to allocate one more drink stall and nore seats for diner.  Otherwise a great mix of food  delicacies.
Went there for thier kopi C. Cheap $1
High ceiling and good natural ventilation unlike typical hawker centre. Lots of food options.

Recommended for casual affordable food in a typical Singapore heartlands"

Clean and airy
Food is reasonably priced
Nice food clean environment
Right now the wet market and some shops closed for renovation but it will be great place to visit and shop when its open again
Tends to be packed during lunchtime on the weekdays and don't expect it to be empty the whole day during weekends. Choices are varied and good but really could make do with more eating spaces.
"Very spacious food centre and crowded during lunch time. There's ample choice fior Halal food. I would recommend the Indian stall selling Mee Goreng, cheap and good."

A place you can get food and not go hungry.
A nice place to eat. Variety of Indian food available.

most of them chatting not eating
"Kampung Admiralty Hawker Cntre is convenient ly situated next to Admiralty MRT station. Wheelchair access, escalator and lift are provided. The are many big powerful fans helping to circulate the air, bring down the heat which normally associated with typical hawker centre, but not here. It is surprisingly cooling esp near the lift area."
Wide variety of food
"Kampung Admiralty  is a mall with shopping centers, restaurants and also a mass rapid transit station on the ground floor of the mall."
Neat and nice
the coffee store long que very slow
Nice food overall
The Thai food stall has good olive fried rice.
Good selection of food but not enough seats

Reasonable price. Cleaned. I loved chicken rice."

Taste of food feels authentic ( for me but it's up to you to decide ) ,I ordered chicken rice from a stall , first taste like alr damn shiok (my opinion) , so highly recommend it , price still ok for a hawker centre . Hope you find this helpful :)"

"A long waited place in Woodlands. Now u xan practically find any local Singapore delights here. Includes a wide choice of Fastfood, Super Market & Post Bank"
Xi Huan Chi A Ma Mian Xian $4.00 Bu Cuo. 
More choices.
"A lots of food choices but not enough seats during lunch hour. I don't like the idea need to return trays on our own especially this center is big and people have to walk a long way in the crowded walk ways to return the tray. Tables are not clean. Because to rely purely on other's kindness to keep the place clean is an unrealistic expectation without regard to human nature. Although I always keep the table that I was eating clean, I don't think everyone is able or willing to do that. Also, if it is expected that people need to keep their table clean just like in their own home, then would center be able to provide tools (towel) and water sink nearby each block of seats so they could easily access to the resources that will support their good behavior of cleaning up their tables after eating. Otherwise, this center will remain dirty and uncomfortable to be in unless I really have no choice I will not eat there although I may do take aways."
There is alot of Food options here... Great for family and friends.

"All these for $3.50  From a stall at the corner (behind a stall selling Chinese pastry and buns) which is more known for it's Sichuan style Fish that you can see many people ordering. This is the mixed mushroom with chicken thigh pieces served with rice in bamboo pot. Also comes with soup with tofu and tomato, and preserved veg long beans and fried chicken pieces (if they have). Flavourful rice, portion very worth the price."

I always go down to B2.lots of space.also can park near to the lift.At B2 you make a loud laugh the place will make echo..so that people at B1 can be heard..hahaha"
Been to quite a few stalls after my weekly driving lessons. Most food are pretty cheap and good. 2 stalls that i have issue with their attitude: china beef noodles and fishball noodles stalls.
"The Fairprice supermarket is too small and tight, and with shoppers pushing around their shopping carts, anyone could be left feeling stressed and claustrophobic whilst shopping in there. The rest of the building is spacious, however, the space could be more strategically used."
My lunch place
"Decent food I guess,  dun have anything that wows me though"
Loved it all the old times food and the szechuan cuisine is a must try it comes in a hot plate.

Mee sua is good
"Newly opened hawker centre. No air con but still quite well ventilated. Ah Ma mee Sua was pretty good. They added a bit of rice wine for flavour. Pork mince had a fragrant taste to it. Prata was quite standard though. All priced reasonably.
Loh mee was quite tasty although the basic one was lacking in ingredients."
Basic necessities under one roof!

Watch out for the turtles that sunbath on the edge of the pond. The 50 hawker stalls on Level 2 sell a wide range of local food. The atrium hosts a series of community events. And all that under the roof of a international award architecture. Nice.
Food is generally okay.. but do like the sitting arrangements.. disoriented.. and not enough chairs..
"Big space below the building, got food court @ 2nd floor"

"Crowded place (went on a Sunday) but serve reasonably priced food.
All the self-return tray kiosks can be improved as it wasn't working, and people had to lay their used trays all over the return station.
Makes it difficult for users."
Most food stalls are value for money. Spacious and not overcrowded at most times.
not bad has everything under one roof
A variety of foods to choose.
"Built as a self-sufficient elderly-friendly community with retail on the first few levels and residential properties above, this development is conveniently located right next to Admiralty MRT Station.

I love the shaded open space in the heart of it, allowing residents and visitors to hang out, while having a wide range of social, healthcare, communal, commercial, and retail facilities within walking distance.

This development also recently (2018) won the World Building of the Year at the World Architecture Festival in Amsterdam, beating 535 others from 57 countries."

Cheap and plenty of nice food here
Good service staff and nurses
Been living in this area since I was a foetus. Now it grew to be a beautiful place with useful and luxury amenities. I'm truly proud and happy. Beside with NTUC fair price and Starbucks cafe alongside with Mr Bean etc. What more can I ask for? So please feel free to drop. Pssss. Try the chicken rice in the food court. No regrets.

Homely place
Very good neighbourhood food court with plenty of food choices. Reasonable prices. There are also other eateries a floor below and a nice Japanese style pastry shop. Only drawback is the crowd on weekends - can expect to wait 10 minutes or so to find a space to seat.
ILL THINKA BOUT IT
"Best place to hang around, sit and chat along with most elderly ppl there."
kampong admiralty hawkers are very big food court it have many varieties of stalls but for outsiders it prices are not cheap as for residents they have a members card is much cheaper
Good variety of foods!
Lack of tables..  Insufficient coffee store.. Only 2 coffee stores and both are veey long queues. Should have more coffee stores if the current stores are unable to cope.
Many nice food
One stop food paradise
Finally tried the hawker Centre at the 2nd floor... Good variety of halal food. Long Q at the Chinese Muslim stall ever since it was MUIS certified. Normal hawker prices.
On the second floor food centre. Avoid the second floor Lor Mee at all costs. Avoid the Malay Tudong Teh Tarik taste no difference from warm water super dulated.
Good food good ppl
Vibrant neighbourhood

Lots of great food like Ah Ma Mee Sua, Prawn noodle, chicken rice, mala fried fish(very worth it) etc. There are three supermarkets around the station and fast food joints like Mos burger, MacDonald and long John silver. Very convenient for daily needs."
Lots of different food stalls. Need time  to search for empty tables though

"A huge single public housing complex integrated with several residential tower block as high as 11 storey, with open air food court at level 2 and other cafeterias and a large central plaza at the ground floor. There is a basement parking with a NTUC supermarket also at the basement level. I spent only half an hour at this place. Hope to explore this place more thoroughly in my next visit."
"I gave it a 4 star all solely for the Thai stall there!
Been there less than 5 times and had the thai stall the last visit and it was impressive. It has the solid ""wok hei"" in its pineapple rice and Thai style fried kway tiao. It's difficult to find good food in woodlands, honestly. I almost didn't want to write this review because hey it's gonna get crowded when people know its good."
very homey
A Lot of variety of food to choose and price is reasonable
Can find alot of thing to eat

The place is food haven what can you say more. There are plenty of halal food stalls (more than 10) serving from nasi padang to carrot cake. There is almost a crowd everytime but you will be able to find space to sit no matter what. The non halal food are plenty and its just a big communal space for foodies.
Interesting
"Nice play to eat, chill and get comfort food"
Variety of foods
Mama pratha shop very arrogant(the old men). Service with no smile. Very calculative.  One order to only 1 curry even though u ordered 2 prathas..use to be able to get 2 choices of curry elsewhere and some even offered sambal. These 'yaya' old men  must learn from the youngster who sometimes serve at order counter. What is wrong with just making the customer happy with providing an extra small portion of curry..not that I'm asking for fish or meat..just plain curry
great staff there nice food easy to order a place i will consider to eat for dinner.
Hard to find seats. But food is good
"Good mall.  However, lacks enough shops and most of the shops are slightly overpriced.  Not enough fast food shops.  The hawker centre is also pretty crowded and quite dirty.  Otherwise it's a clean place."

"Hawkers Centre:  Lots of food stalls. High ceiling. Comfortable. Some items are food court prices though...but as dictated in the FoodFare contracts, stalls have to have an item @2.xx or thereabout...
On the ground floor, there are restaurants @restaurants' prices."

Disappointed with the food court. Always difficult to find seat. Stalls much more than available seats. Definitely Underdesigned the capacity.
Lots of cheap and good food here
Great neighbourhood shopping mall. Have most shop that sells daily stuff that you need. Nearby have KFC..MCD...Long john...Ample bike and car lots at basement.Little ex for parking though.
No enough table here
"Has a food court upstairs and a nice garden area on one of the upper floors.
However, kampung admiralty has a small selection in terms of shops available. The food variety is not much there except for a Starbucks and makisan. There are others but in comparison to other locations, kampung admiralty doesn't offer much food. The good thing is that the queues are often short. For shopping, there is only minoso and a ntuc. There is also not much atms seen there."
"like the Sichuan store there, selling authentic Sichuan food"
Especially the variety of food available there
Good location with 3 supermarket nearby and food court
"Pin Zhong Qi,Fu Wu Hao"
Reasonably priced food and the place is cooling. Tend to be hard to find tables during peak hours.b

Spacious and a variety of food to choose from.
Food here is nice.. will always comeback for more
"It is a place with lots of variety, despite having famous chain stores in its outlets, the prices are affordable. Would say its a good place if you want a easy to access place with good food and yet affordable, even comfortable seating!

Very exciting since starbucks yakun charterise and mos burg opened

Cosy neighbourhood
Nicely-landscaped neighbourhood mall with a few shops/restaurants/cafes and a large hawker centre. Most of the place is not air-conditioned but quite breezy. The fried yong tau foo at the hawker centre is pretty good; the other stalls are mostly average. There is basement parking.
"Great place to be at.. Walkable distance from admiralty. 1st level food is good, hawker on 2nd level closes around 9pm and the food is normal"

However, I prefer not to dine here as it is very difficult to get seats and queues are very long. The stall layout made it difficult to look for the types of food available. The queue at the beverage stall is also very long."
You Hao Duo Mei Shi
"Here at Kampung Admiralty Hawker  Center, you can find the congregation of diverse tasty local foodstuff prepared by tested local masters of the trade from around Singapore!"
Varieties of hawkers food and activities.Good mixed of Supermarkets.
Nice place. Difficult to find sit. Food not cheap.
Loads of eateries 
"This is a pretty new hawker centre, the price as compared is much cheaper, strongly recommend the A Ma Mian Xian it is very nice. The soup is very tasty and the ingredients are plentiful. Do try the corner stall Kao Yu for $18 you get a large deep fried seabass."
Good effort in foodfare making it a hawker centre experience. Spacious but they should prioritise making more seats available.
Large arrays of food. Spoilt for choice!
"Lots of selection, spacious and well ventilated. May be hard to find seats sometimes"
Love it because there alot of thing and food
Very expensive
"A lot of varieties of choice, very spacious and ventilation."
"Great place for family, or couples."
Well is quit busy area as alots of shops and restaurants...
"great variety and options and range, and at good hawkers prices. the entire area is pretty clean too, and very spacious - but it could really do with a little more seatings though."
"Cleanliness can be improved. Varieties of food, from local to western.  Halal & non halal are segregated. Price is reasonable."
Nice place for variety of local food.
Good place but toilet condition not good. Got to bring own toilet papers
Well advance restaurant and nice food.
Good food here
Nothing to shout about. Can give it a miss.
"Allowing myself to be independent. Understood, when to render and how to render their assistance..."
New kampung
Many food stalls but selling almost the same thing
A lot of shop selling food. There's POSB bank n NTUC Supermarket. Food court not bad but not enough sit to dine in.
Good food and environment
"The food centre is  surrounded by flats, and hence poor air circulation unless sitting under the large fans. The large fans are not evenly distributed thus some areas are very stuffy."
One of the big fan been down for so long and yet it hasn't been fixed...wondering what the ppl in management doing
Its a new hawker center. Practising self returned tray hawker center. Whereby some people will help to self return tray but the table will still left dirty without much cleaners to clean the table.
Good place. Its a multi racial gathering place.
No shopping .. mostly food
Great place to be!
Have a good mix of retail outlets with wide relax setting and also a sheltered event space.
Food here are good and reasonably priced .. airy place .. but they should improve on the lift .. seems not as fast as I expected even though there are 6 of them
Still building up to be a family hub
Variety of local food
Nice place . A lot food & ficility
Very good multi-purpose hub. Places to eat and to shop for groceries.
Foodfare on 2nd floor offers wide variety of above average fare at very reasonable prices. Good seating even at peak. Like the wash basins  placed at intervals and the airy feel. Rest of place the usual outlets. Could have better integration with Admiralty Place next door.
We need a design like this 50 years ago.
"Kong Jian Da, Bu Re, Ke Shi Dian Ti Na Li De Wei Zi Xu Yao Zhuang Feng Shan,Na Li Bi Jiao Re, Bi Jiao Shao Shou Wan Die De Gong Ren. "
Modern kampung style hawker...
Lor Mee was good
Great food
Always like the many choices
"Lotta delicious food, pretty recommended"
Nice place. Every now and then got social events events. Also got many foodcourts and eateries. NTUC supermarket at basement 1 is also convenient bcoz next to carpart. Pharmacy and medical centre is also good for me to go for supplements and health issues.
"Built specialy for old and senior citizen. Dispensary and clinics for the sick. Wheelchair accessible everywhere plus elevators.
NTUC and POSB at basement. Food centre at the 2nd floor. Medical centre on the upper floors.
Fast food outlets, Malay restaurant on the ground floor joining with Admiralty MRT and their shoplots. Both places makes a wide variety of shopping and food shoplots."
Tons of new food outlets and then roof garden is nice to relax
One word ...Awesome
Spoilt for choice of food
Do u know there is a bicycle shop hidden somewhere? 
Very accessible by train. I like the Ah Ma mee sua especially. The queue can br long especially on days when some stalls are having their rest day.
It has things that I need for my household. Could have been better if they have more bank.
Lot of interesting food with reasonable price.
Good variety of food and cheap coffee
Cheap good food
"Clean , spacious, lots of tables and seats available but of course not during busy lunch hour"
Wish there were more shops
Such wow ah ma mee sua doin me a full
Clean environment
A new hawker
"Okay there are good food, but most of the stuffs are overpriced with very ungenerous portions even with an upsize. The tables and chairs are apparently insufficient which gives the place a very distorted feel."
Variety of food stalls at level 2 and lively open air activities/events happening every weekend at lvl 1.
"Nothing much to shop there.  But thank God, ntuc is at the basement.  Well design, clean n spacious. Including posb."
Weekday lunch hour are usually pack.
Over crowded place
Good food court and a unique garden at the top. 
"This hawker centre looks pretty, and there is a wide variety of food choices to choose from."
"Nice place to have a meal with stalls serving a variety of hawker foods. There are a few notable delicious food here like the roti prata,  mee suah soup and lor mee /prawn noodles soup which usually attract a long queue during mealtimes. However, one biggest setback for this new foof court is the lack of chairs. During mealtimes, it is very common to see diners going around the food court searching for chairs. Do not understand why the Food Court Management cannot provide enough chairs despite having ample empty tables around. This chair shortage has been for quite some time and still not resolved as of this review."
Choices rather limited. Prices is quite high for the economy rice
Nice environment many halal food n other food as well all under one roof 
Worst place. They have tables with no chairs.
Cheap and good
Good environment
Wide variety of food. Interesting architecture and cheap coffee
90% unhealthy based upon my standard and only 10% consider healthly
Lots of local food easy Access too.
Its fun and cool
"The 1st kampung that was built to cater to the needs of the aged. A pharmacy, medical centre, hawker centre, supermarket and multi purpose corner to complement the tenants of a studio apartment that was built above the complex."
Food is Ok but expensive as hawker stall.
Place is clean and looks hygienic. Has variety of food available ranging from fast food to foodcourts catering to both muslim and non-muslim.
"Definitely a good place to satisfy your food cravings ! However it'll be a pretty difficult task to find seatings, so try to go early to guarantee yourself a place to enjoy your meals"
Great food. Nice ambience. Convenient location. Excellent service. Well done!
Very new and clean food court. The architect who design it has put alot of consideration to ensure it is well ventilated and cool. But most of the stalls selling decent taste food except for few exception which you can see long queue. Also take note the seating is often difficult to find.
Nice environment n friendly facilities.
Am told this is a great place. Does anyone know if this place is open today (17/06/18) seeing that it's Hari Raya Day 3? Hungry ..... appreciate any advice if anyone's been there.
New and variety foods
Lack of variety
"Surprise by the variety of shops that's packed in this building. There's Starbucks, Miniso and coffeshop on 2nd floor. Love the halal chicken rice,i would say one of the best in the north west region for halal char siew chicken rice. The best in my opinion is still the char siew chicken from Changi City Point Kopitiam."
"Always insufficient chairs !! Have to hunting for chairs every time dinning there..
Pls do something!!"
Reasonable prices for food
Good environment for family retreat n family oriented
Very cool concept and many interesting shops like makisan
Nice place
"Disappointed that there are a shortage of chairs, went to the information counter to give feedback but no one was around,  there was a telephone number at the counter stated to call for feedback but when I called,  the staff said that their department is not in charge .
Few days back,  I saw a lady at the counter,  she told me the same thing and gave me the numbers to call myself."
Food is not bad. Price reasonable. Always crowded~~~ a good thing ~
Good for basic needs
Nothing special. Too expensive as kampng living for the old folk.
"Shortage of chair, not user friendly for senior citizens. Younger generation not following return tray concepts"
Nice choice of food but severe lack of chairs around.
this place is open space has alot of air coming in and easy to walk good food as well
"Clean, airy. Love the spaciousness best."
Big open area with a few shops and eatery
"New hawker centre that is next to the MRT station. Big, airy and spacious with lots of choices. Seats are spaced haphazardly, and expect to spend some time looking for seats during peaking hours"
The variety of food stalls is good but during peak hour times..you can hardly find a seat! There is ample table space but no chairs. Never been to a place without enough chairs. I would avoid this place if not for the decent food and affordable prices.
Nice place alot of gud food but food court have no air condition and the place does jot have much stuff like shopping malls
Shi Wu He Jin Can Huan Jing Du Hen Bu Cuo
Good place to chill and eat
It is self-sufficient place that covers most services that you need

There are lots of food you'll be spoilt for choices I personally recommend the pig bone soup aka bak kut teh
Awesome amenities..
Variety of shops...2nd floor.. food centre selling varieties of local food..halal and non-halal..
Windy and the foods are delicious.
"If you are looking for economically priced food near Admiralty MRT, this is the place to be. Lots of choices at the NTUC Foodfare foodcourt and the environment is spacious. Note that the food court is not air-conditioned and it practises a ""self-return tray"" policy. We used to be Neanderthals who expect people to clean after us but we are making progress. Please bear with us."
Great new place to eat!
Limited seated chair
Not bad but place tend to be quite dirty.
"Integrated living with shopping, food, medical centre, pharmacy, library, child care cehtre, roof top gardening, etc for elderly and young"
Nice place for everyone.
New place with great food. Need to provide easy access to the hawker on level 2
"We are staying here in a modern vertical kampung. Our retirement village, with abundance of activities for retirees."
This place is not worth your time to visit because during the peak hours you will spend more time looking for empty table to sit then you actually spend your time eating. Be prepared to get disappointed and frustrated.
Place is child & elderly friendly. Ample amount of food stall to choose from. The high ceiling makes the place windy and comfortable while eating. There is a supermarket & other amenities around that makes it a one-stop location.
"A lot of food, but lack of places to sit."
Good variety
Ah Ma meesua is so nice
Great food. Lota of malay food to try. Cheap

Great Food! Affordable and for family get together. Do note there's service charge.

The Chinese Coffee Shop Staff was very abrupt and rude. It Was my first time there for Brunch. Didn't know that the NTUC FOODFARE  APP was only for downloading and not for use there!  She  answered rudely.. Just pay the $2.90!
Nice place to have a good meal!

"Shi Wu Xuan Ze Duo

Very big hawer center
"Cosy ambience, great for large groups because they have joining tables and booth seating. Food is perfect, one of the best in the North. Serving portions can be big too , drinks included. Worth your money and definitely great to bring your family down for reunions."
Many shops
Fantastic variety of good food and the place is always very packed and vibrant!
Modern place that looks upscale but prices are generally kept low. Decent selection of local delights within the second story hawked centre. A good place to hangout when the weekend or evening crowd is not there.
No character as the name is trying to imply. Rain came thru the roof during heavy downpour. Watch that puddle to avoid slippery surface.
Spacious seating
Nice environment will lot of choices
"A hawker centre with good mix of food. Airy place with seats even for big group gathering. There is fast food and coffee joint (both kopi & coffee),  supermarket and even halal seafood restaurant. MRT is just a stone throw away."
"Enjoy the numerous delicious food available there. Chinese, Malay, Indian & western food for you to choose."
Wonderful food everywhere!!
Not all open
"This is a multistorey building with different amenities for residents living there and in the neighbourhood. There is a POSB bank in the  and NTUC Supermarket in the basement which makes shopping for groceries very easy (linked to the basement carpark). On the first storey there are restaurants, cafes, eateries, sundry shops and a pharmacy.

On the second storey is a big food court with at least 30 stalls. All kinds of hawker food at very low price. You can get a decent meal for $2.50. Coffee is at 70 cents per cup. This food court practices self returning tray. So return the plates and bowls after eating please.

Above the food court are medical centres and a nursing home. There are also few floors of studio apartments on the top few floors.

There is a big foyer on the first storey where community events can be held there. It's also a nice breezy place to hang around after your  dinner at the food court."
"It's clean and new with nice amenities, there's also a large variety of shops that cater to different needs!"
Clean and nice food court. The foods are delicious too.
It has a wide variety of food choices as well as shopping

"2 level of basement carpark. NTUC supermarket at B1. Ground level have some shops. Hawker centre at level 1. Very spacious. Mixture of food. There also vegetarian stall there.

Beside the hawkers, there are labs test facilities and pharmacies.

There two Residential blocks A and B. You will not see the block  A or B from the outside."
Service very prompt and friendly. FOOD was delicious and awesome
Clean food court
Pros: Easy to find table. Very nice lor Mee and prawn noodle. Cons: Very few food variety for such a big hawker food center.
Clean and convince  place
Good pork porridge!
"Very clean and nice.  The food selection was impressive.  Seldom do I comment on hawkers centres but I have to give a shout-out to the cold and hot deserts stall. Their ""Chendol"" was very generous and tasty.  I recommend no other."
Stalls are ok but not enough tables and seats.
Great place. All that is lacking is a Post Office. Thumbs up if you agree! =)

"Makisan, Chateraise, good food court. Great place to hangout and eat."
Good dining option
"Plus one star for bright, clean and windy environment, minus one star for the foods."
The last known kampung in Singapore. Brings back nostalgic feels of the olden days Admiralty.
"Clean and pleasant environmrnt esp,  the hawker  centre @ 2nd storey."
Variety of food available..
Food is good
"Ah Ma mee sua , traditional lor mee , prawn mee and many many more super nice stall"
"Doesn't look like a Kampung at all. Was expecting wooden plank wall, zinc or dried plam leaves roof. More like modern mall. Hehe"
Long queue on weekends. Big serving but reasonably price.
Love the atmosphere. Tjough the food court could do with many more seats
"Spacious and room to walk. Short of tables to utilize. Easily could have fit in more seating area.

Many stall seem inexperienced. Hence the longer q and wait.

Better drinks at level.

If u drive. Might as well go for fish soup down the road."
Good variety for shopping and a supermarket.
Nice place..
"Lots of open space & airy with the huge fans everywhere.
Not enough seating for lunch crowd, should have provided more tables & seats..."
Food is good n cheap.. plus its near e mrt.. bad point.. might nt have enuff seatings even though its spacious..
Good place to shop for groceries and have a good dinner at the few eateries
It is good
Very good.
Love the food selections
Everything is there. Love this place
Amazing ATM
"Lots of food, most with awards.
Place is big and lots of seats but crowded during peak hours!
The place is cooling due to its design.
Tray return system but then many of the people still leave the dishes there even though the station just RIGHT BESIDE THEMMMM!!!!!"
"This place is a welcome addition to the North Side of Singapore and it gives a lot of options for food. Makisan is there for delicious sushi and Kampung Yassin is sedap. Though it is not a thai restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised when I ate the Tom Yam soup from Kampung Yassin as it is so GOOOOOD! It's better than some thai restaurants *coughs* Bali Thai. On the second level you have a hawker centre with all kinds of food. I personally love My Kampung Chicken Rice stall as it is very affordable and tasty."
I enjoy t place
"Love the ambience, quality of food and reasonable prices."
Finally a NTUC supermarket for Admiralty residents! Thanks!
"Many food outlets, really good variety. V breezy too and has rooftop garden."
Food so so only. Windy with big ceiling  fans installed. Most stores have $2.80 value meals.
"All-in-one building: has a food court, fast food restaurants (Long John's, Mos Burger), Starbucks, supermarket, medical centre and more."
It's a small mall compared to Causeway point which is one station away. But we came here for the food. Yassin was a great place to eat and hang out with friends and family. Cosy restaurant.
"Admiralty mrt sekitarnya banyak toko, food court dan pasar, sangat memudahkan saya belanja utk keperluan di aptmn kakak saya di woodland ring blk 640 yg tidak jauh dari sana."
Great food
"New place, ntuc fairprice and posb bank together with other eateries"
"Like the food court there, good varieties of food, but it is a bit pricey for the location. Customers doesn't have habit to clean up the plates, it is difficult to rely on the cleaners as it is a relatively big food court. There is a big covered and airy area underneath the food court for organising event"
Ample seats for customers
Clean & nice place for family out think
Good food.
Birthday gathering....thumbs up.
Why is there no telephone no for the information counter.
Crowded ...

"New hawker centre increased the number for food stalls which brings more variety to residents. Also other food chains such as mosburger, mr bean, starbucks, yassin etc. also opened there which gives a good mix of restaurant, fast food, and hawker food. Wide open spaces for many activities to be held. In general it has brought much convenience to residents, and also made the atmosphere much livelier."
Very well ventilated
The mee jian kuey is so good
Good! One stop shop for all you need.
"Clean , convenient and lots of varieties / options"
You are able to get a decent meal at $2.80..like a bowl of Yong Tau Foo Bee Hoon or Lor Mee..
Easy Parking facilities. Various stores found. EZ shopping at FairPrice and POSB branch beside it.
The place is airy n bright. The meals offered at the hawker centre are good enough for me n my spouse to patronise often. Hd most of meals at the kampung Admiralty. So far no dissatisfaction from me. Facilities are impressive. 
Food is good but forever no tissues paper provided. Always finished eating with sticky hands.
One the most expensive drink I got at foodcourt...1.80 for a coke??!
Service 2 slow....
Low calories food and cheap
Awesome food and awesome service.. its a must to visit when u are there.. definitely a great experience and the atmosphere there is like u are dining in a expensive place.

Not a bad place for dinner as many new stalls and prices still within ordinary folk's budget although can get pretty packed in the evenings.
Good but I always have to wait and look around to be seated.
Variety of local food with reasonable price
Hawker is spacious and windy. Food was surprisingly good considering that it is a food court
Clean place n nice environment . Food r good too. Request for Old Chung Kee Stall n Xiang Wei Dried Pork stall.thns

Nice taste food
Very good environment and easy to access
Thumbs yup...clean n spacious good mix of eateries
"Nice and cosy ambience. Just right portion and delicious. Price is a bit expensive but i think its worth the food. Service is good and fast, that's why they charged the 10% service charge."
Very cozy and nice environment.  Must try the food at hoker center.
Very cool space that creates an inclusive community. Glad to see such a place being created in Singapore
Vegetarian food choice available
Great place for medical appointments and the hawker serves really good cheap food.
Good selection of food outlets for older and younger people. The lor mee and mee sua at the food court is good.
"Super packed after office hours but that aside, the indian stall that sells briyani, naans and butter chicken i forgot its name, honestly 2 cheese naan and butter chicken with such a tiny bowl for $9??? I dont think it's worth it. The butter chicken from Bedok and Mr.Prata's is so much tastier at about the same price. The butter chicken is not worth its price. $9, are u kidding me i was so shocked. And the naans are not even as fluffed as mr.prata to cost a hefty. I finished in 5 bites. The bowl looks like it's for kid's menu."
"""Secure My Bike"" facility"
"""Secure My Bike"" facility"

Spacious and airy!
"The design of the carpark entrance is weired. And that's the reason management assign a traffic controller. As for the hawker centre, always hard to find the seat from breakfast till dinner."
I'm amazed at the indoor food court. Not overcrowded and is really clean. Food are reasonably priced.
Lot of uncle n aunties
"Foodfare is good if you know the good stalls, like mee sua. Void deck level is meh."
"My family tried mee sua, laksa, hokkien noodle (Halal and not halal ), mix vege rice. The food only so so. Environment ok"
There are lots to eat over there but you can also buy stuffs at the new Fair price.
Great food cheap prices!
Too bad we can't make payment with our ntuc link cards. Why do they put top up machines there but we can't enjoy discount or make payment with our cards?
Can USE cashless payment using QR code at the stalls there.
Cashless system not functioning and Ntuc cash storage card also useless.
Yassin Restaurant nice food
"Spacious, cold breeze"
"The food court is clean and spacious, many varieties of nice cooked food.
Especially the hainanese chicken rice is very nice to eat."

Lots of eateries. Suitable for families and all. Nice and love the place.
Forever buzzing with people
Good location for the hawker food. This is much better than the food court. Price is also more affordable. The place is also airy and not cramped like the other hawker centre. There should be more such hawker centre.

Great hawker food fare on Level 2
"The newest and most exciting feature of Admiralty. It's housing, makan (hawker & fast food), medical centre, supermarket and park rolled into one. And well designed! Conveniently located next to Admiralty MRT. As far as community projects go this is one of Singapore's best."
"Clean, cooling and pretty average food. Unique building in the heartlands with a new concept and pretty awesome ceiling fans. Keep it that way Singaporeans."
Nice food court
"Clean, modern and food is nice"
"Spacious hawker center with many seats.. food not bad, ntuc supermarket going to open soon, 1 POSB bank is just next to it. Nice place"
"lots of store but rather pricey compared to other hawker center or market.

The place has a self return tray policy and you would be asked politely by staff to return your own tray when you are leaving.

Too many stores too little seats during peak hour."
"Awesome food, great prices, nice windy ambience."
Lots of local food with fair price. Nice for seniors all around.
Overpriced hawker food!!!
"Diabetes and Eye centre
a lot of food stall at NTUC foodfare"
"Hai Jun Bu Cun Wei Du Te She Qu Da Sha,You Le Ling Gong Yu,Yi Liao Zhong Xin.Yin Xing.Xiao Fan Zhong Xin.Shang Dian.Wu Ding Hua Yuan.Huo Dong Zhong Xin:"
"Cleaning auntie is very rude. After finish eating why must return the dirty plate to the return tray ourself? The clearing auntie very loudly scolded us in chinese 'impolite'!! OMG! That is so rude!
I won't come back to this place again."
Clean & spacious food court.. spoilt for choices 
"Rule #1
Return own tray and crockery. Great effort though i personally think should impose some kind of reward n punishment system for those who didnt return them. Still saw some plates n trays lying ard. Shame on these people"
Clean. Nice. Pls return the tray after eating. Mixture of shops found here.
Tray return seem like. A failure in this hawker centre.. ... Simplily there are not enough station for collection of used cockery. Have to walk a distant to return.
Nice mala Xiang Guo (Ma La Xiang Guo)will definitely come back to eat again!
"Nice and clean. With admiralty place, I don't need to  go to causeway point. Good improvement to admiralty area."
It's an amazing place to eat and shop i recommend you to visit the place
"Good variety of food, good ambience and clean!"
Too hot as fans are still off even after 8 am.
"Food is acceptable but ventillation is horrible!! That is a big ""No no"" for any hawker centres. We are literally sweating whole eating."
"Everything you need in one modern design environment in HDB precinct, Starbucks, MOS Burger, Yah Kun, Japanese Desserts, Banks, Medical Centre and Hawker Centre."
"Since it's a new place, can't blame it for being packed at meal hours. However, the cleaner services are bad. Don't get me wrong, I'm not talking about their efficiency, it is their attitude. I tried to tray return but the shelve for trays is full. I stood there for more than 10seconds, holding my tray full of bowls and plate as I watch the cleaners (3 of them) walk pass me pretending im invisible. If this can happen to me, I believe it can too to anyone. It ended with my father pissed at this sight and took my tray and placed it on one of the cleaner's push cart. Sure, there is huge variety of food choices. But this would discourage me from going there to eat again."
"Management should take a good look at the pricing policies of this stall with the signboard ""Porridge"". Food is ridiculously priced and the information is not well reflected on the menu. $1.20 for chicken/pork dish is in fact $1.50 when ordered in small plates. Portions as attached in the pictures. Utterly shocked at the price i have to pay at a hawker. Only good enough to feed a toddler. Ordered a porridge meal for myself and end up not able to satisfy my tummy. Go order from Rice Garden next to it. You will have no regrets after taking into the account the price difference.
I leave it to you all to judge. And Hell NO. I won't be returning for sure.

Total damage $6. I presume the extra charges are for the extra small plates that need to be washed.
Chicken $1.50 for that tiny protein with bones. Egg $1. Ngoh Hiang $1.50 for 2 pathetic pieces while u can easily get 3 for $1 outside. Tau Kwa $1.50 for that little baby portion Ba Chor. Porridge $0.50.
Such a wonderful meal. I am just a peasant. Don't need royalty's price."
Breakfast choices seem limited. Well ventilated with escalators leading up and down.
"Please don't order seafood mee goreng at this Fried Hokkien Prawn Nee at this stall because they just add chilli sauce to the hokkien mee that's all.it's horrible to eat.I My just gone waste.

to eat to eat."
"This is a nice place. Just opened. There is this stall called kampung something (is a malay food stall). The stall owner is very generous, always give us extra serving since the first time I went there to eat. Its convenient to pay using NTUC card."
Very comfortable food court with great food varieties at affordable prices.
"We were shopping at Katong Shopping Centre and we were told to the chicken rice at basement level. The queue was long. When it was our turn to collect the, I was so excited. The chicken came with a delicious soup, roasted chicken and a plate of cucumber and pineapple salad. This is one of the best chicken rice I've eaten. I was so sumptuous that I finished the whole plate of rice. It's noisy as many people were queueing to place their orders. You have to wait at least 15 minutes before your number is called. But it's worth the wait. You should try the chicken rice here. It's awesome! "
"May25, it was a Sunday just after 2pm and the crowd is still coming. We r there for the Chicken rice; very different from the best out there. Here the chicken fragments r just up there, if you order 2 rice it comes with a large soup, 4 rice with 2 soup plus vinegar pineapple onion etc. we came here 3-4 times a year due to the distances. The laksa YTF is heaven, one of the best. Not having it with the chicken rice is a loss a must have LAKSA YTF. We did try the hot fun it was good while waiting for the chicken. Can have it if you want. A1 or A2 both r good. Overall for 1st timing must come to try but prepare to wait for the chicken. Pricing slightly higher but super good. Service is fast. Highly recommend."
"This place has the best chicken rice in the East. The flavour has been  consistent if not better, as I can recall when they had a stall outside the old National Library hawker centre . The newly added fruity salad n richly boiled soup served with the chicken rice makes you crave n come back for more whenever you think of eating chicken rice. Don't miss it as good food must be shared ."
Love the chicken rice here!
"Katong Gourmet Centre is a highly recommended food court with excellent food choices! This food court may be small but is air conditioned, clean, and comfortable. Importantly it houses several famous food stalls like the chicken rice stall, so be prepared for some wait for good quality food. Staff here are friendly too. Will definitely be back again soon!  Take note Katong Shopping Centre also has another indoor food court on the other end of the centre."
Small hawker indoor with AC. Can be a bit hard to find seats. Although only a few shops they do some nice dishes.
The chicken rice there is 5 out of 5!
Yong Tau Fu was great!
Basically u have here for either chicken rice of wat tan horfun
"Service is very good, although we have to collect the food on our own but the staff in the stall is very nice and friendly, easy to talk to. The area is quite cooling and aircon place. But they after 8.30pm, so make sure be there around 7pm plus. Food wise we only order their moonlight hor fun, crispy noodle + horfun and ipoh fried pork? Total was $19.80 which is very worthy and cheap. The food is very nice too, moonlight horfun i would give 9/10, but their crispy noodle with hor fun is 10/10, something that I never tried before!! Their ipoh crispy pork is very nice too. 1 of the greatest zi char represent Malaysia!! Boleh!!!!!"
"Still retained the old school flavour from decades ago. Generous portions and pickles were great. Juicy pieces of chicken and peppery soup, with a punchy chilli sauce. Be prepared to wait for up to 15mins at peak hours."
Everything you need
Ipoh delicious food is here .
Jia Dong Mei Wei Ji Fan Hao Chi
Throwback to 80s. Popular chicken rice. Must try.
"Could do with more cleaning staff.
Staff was severely overwhelmed despite many customers self service cleaning.

More loose chairs should be provided for the loose tables. As many people using the loose chairs for their bags (partly due to the not so pristine tables)"
"I came here solely for Mei Wei Delicious Boneless Chicken Rice offers some of the best chicken rice in Singapore. The meat is succulent, and the rice is simply amazing. While the ambiance of the place may not be the most impressive, the quality of the food more than makes up for it. After all, this is Singapore, where the rustic charm adds to the overall dining experience."
"Went here to check out Katong Mei Wei chicken, as I approached the food center area, I came across a bad smell, something of roaches. So that turned me off and I decided not to eat here. On the opposite side of the basement, there is an food court that is more pleasing to the eye and definitely 100% cleaner so that's where my friend and I ate instead."
"Mei Wei Chicken rice is good, the only counter doing any business. Obviously quite famous now, chicken super tender and juicy, vegetables and beansprouts sides good. Crispy pork and the rice itself could be better. Maybe a victim of its own success soon."
"Hun Tun Tang De Hun Tun Xian Xia Xian Liao Bu Cuo,Tang Tou Pu Tong"
Go for the regular famous chicken rice stall
"Bu Cuo De Yun Hou Mian, Dan Bing Bu Shi Zui Hao Chi De"
Like to eat their ytf laksa
Malaysia local food .
Very popular chicken rice. I found the food average only. Rice was quite dry.
Same comments as Boon Hua Mei Mei boneless chicken rice stall. Tables layout and food court is small
"Vi tri dep, mon an tam duoc"
Great if you don't care Unclean places
Chao dah smell was a bit strong for the moonlight kuey teow. For hokkiem noodles and Yee mee noodles were good.
Nice old fashioned food court with good food. Liked the ipoh horfun and the sotong was good aswell
Chicken rice stall no more refill soup. Food standard drop. Not worth my time anymore.
For the chicken rice
Very run down
We had dinner there and the food was really good!
"Dark, crowded, hard too find seats"
Nice chicken rice
Went here for the IPOH food but thought they put too much MSG inside and abit overrated but nice nonetheless
"Two famous stores out of entire place. Be prepared to queue and wait up to 45mins during peak hrs at these two stores

Tables and seats were extremely scarce."
"Used to it, it used to be our local. Very good chicken rice as always. Grumpy drinks man as always"
Pretty rundown n need a facelift soon plus the aircon is not cold anymore.
It's still great tasting after so many years. Good place to eat.
My regular go to place for Chicken rice n YTH
"Always come here for the chicken rice, have been coming here since I was in primary school. One of the best if not the best Chicken rice for me."
"Lots of v good local food, esp chicken rice, yong tau foo, and the ipoh dai loke noodles. Limited seats, tho."
Exhaust need to be improved as you will come out smelling of the place.
"Little eating corner at Katong Shopping Centre basement end.
Just a few stalls but drinks & chicken rice etc available.
Outside the building there are a few more standalone eating booths offering a variety of cuisines."
"Order half chiken ( mix roast /steam ),oyster veg and glizzard total damage $30++,  free chicken leg soup and cabbage veg soup. The chicken nice and the rice so fragrance. Highly recomended"
Got a few eatery
Small eatery
Chicken rice is obviously the most popular amongst all. 2 stalls had shut down Thai visit. There's a noodles stall next to chicken rice which I'm going to give a shot next visit
Chicken ricerhe best
"All good nich tasy food under one roof. It is an old place but environment is clean. A good place to grab food, rest before carry on to other malls at walking distance that is not far. Roxy square - famous laksa, i12katong all yummy cafe and restaurants plus GV Movie theater."
"Shi Wu Zhong Lei Hen Duo,Hen You Te Se"
"Every week I'm there. It's mandatory, in a way. Suggest to avoid 12-1.30pm."
Tuck Kee moonlight hor fun with wok hei was the highlight of the meal. Tender soft spicy sliced meat taste  delicious and meatball soup were flavorful. We all enjoyed very much. Will be back again.
Chicken rice n Malaysian zhi char good.
Airconditioning food court with few stalls that sell good food. Usually I go there to eat chicken rice which is very nice.
Here for the KTMW
Lots of maid agencies here. If you are looking to hire maids this would be the place. There is also a parisik electronic store here. Try the apple pie store or the dirty cheesecake if you are in the area
"Mini food court that has the popular chicken rice stall. The yong tau fu is also popular. The western food servings look big. There is also a noodle stall. Not giving 5 stars because despite the diners need to return their empty crockery and cutlery nowadays, there is no one to clean the tables."
"One of the best chicken rice in Singapore, the free flow achar and soup is a plus too!"
"Chicken Rice cannot make it liao, but the other ZiChar store seems quite good."
"Small, quiet and nice food."
"The famous Katong Chicken Rice place, now with good western food, very nice pork chop! The fried carrot cake, Malaysia style zhichar is also very nice, not forgetting the Yong Tai foo..."
Food not nice
Cheap..n delicious 
Good portion of chicken. Very tender. Also tried the chye tow Kueh.
Good zichar and carrot cake!
Not much food at about 3pm.
"Things are expensive here and taste just like any other coffee shop standards.
If I could, I would avoid having meals here."
Many good food selling inside this food court
"Air con place that kenna pwned by Katong Mei Wei aka delicious boneless  rice. Basically, you can get a bunch of other food but the chicken rice is what most are having.

Only dummies go Chatterbox. True connoisseurs of chicken rice know this is better."
"Great mini kopitiam with 3 great food stalls.

Must try. Fried carrot cake & Yue Guang Hor Fun.

Average to Good. Chicken rice. Big portion. Comes with achar and soup."
Clean. A lot of food stall can choose
One of the best chicken rice in town
Best chicken rice. Foc soup
"chicken rice famous but not as nice as last time, still good.
got some new stalls, didnt try any of them"
Ventilation not good. Chicken rice smell on clothes
Mei Shi Me Dong Xi Chi
"Everything is great there.
Awesome chicken rice, great offering of ipoh food dishes, good Western menu & very consistent yong tau foo.

Only downsides are the lack of seats, the crowd & how ""ulu"" or hard to get to the place is."
Tried the chicken rice.  Generous portion and love the soup too!
"Old, shabby, not the cleanest.  But the Zi Char is really good and so is the Western food stall (remember to double up)."
The Chicken rice stall is good.. Value for money.. The soup and appetizer are foc..
"Anyone doing shopping in Katong Shopping Centre will have to come here. Must not miss this place!

Inside are two popular hawker stall selling chicken rice and Malaysia Ipoh Hor Fun.

After patronising either one of them, you will surely come back for more again."
Nice variety and quite a few stalls with great offerings
"Superb chicken rice.  Be it roasted or boiled white chicken. It's still one of the Chikedee stall in Singapore. Add De soup delight with a plate of Archar
It's fulfilling and fiercely shiok to your
Joint. Must Queue, wait and you Will Enjoy.. Must carry on makan."
This Yong tau foo stall at food court is very nice..
Popular for Chicken rice.  Like the complimentary achar that comes together with chicken rice.
"Its one of the best chicken rice stall in .scculent & great taste. Plus
A bowl of well broth cabbage soup And
Achar to content with.
Must carry on makan.  "
Food is ok. But please dont spend $1 to add extra noodles. Total rip off. The total amount of noodles after adding was like only half the yellow bowl. I wonder what it looks like if i did not add.
"Mediocre meepok, nothing special. The sauce used isn't fragrant so the dish doesn't standout imo. At least the chopped chilli is fresh compared to the normal sad looking ones outside!"
"Each bowl is individually prepared, so expect a wait, especially during peak hours.This stall was previously located at Jago Close market near the NTUC.

The signboard features prawns, but none were included in our order--perhaps they're only available in the larger portions. Serving sizes are on the smaller side, making for a satisfying yet light breakfast.

Fish Ball Kway Teow Soup ($4.50) - 7/10
A comforting, traditional bowl of kway teow soup where the highlight was the bouncy fish balls, boasting a natural sweetness from the fish. The broth was on the milder side, with chye poh adding a subtle savory note. The bowl also included minced pork, fish cake, and beansprouts, complementing the light, clean flavors. However, with only two fish balls, the portion felt a little sparse. The kway teow itself was average--thicker and less smooth than ideal. A simple, familiar dish but not particularly memorable.

Mee Pok ($4.50, white no chili/ketchup) - 8/10
Compared to the kway teow soup, the mee pok delivered a bolder, more satisfying bite. The same bouncy fish balls took center stage, accompanied by a single her kiao, minced and sliced pork, and a crispy piece of lard. The sliced pork was exceptionally tender, soaking up the rich umami of the pork-based soup. The fish paste flavors stood out more here, likely due to the drier preparation allowing them to shine. With its slightly firmer noodles and more pronounced seasoning, the mee pok was definitely the more flavorful choice."
"Ping Jun Yi Shang da. 
It is above average"
Love this place - eaten there for ten years at Jago close.  The family business is generous on servings.  Old style teow chew fish ball Mee Pok
"Comparing the two Teochew Noodles stalls in this Marine Parade Central Market, I would rather this stall over the other, solely based on the variety of ingredients for the same price point, would highly recommend, and do note there can be a queue"
"Was enticed by the clear prawn soup that looks legit and decided to give it a try.

Ordered prawn kueh teow dry version and it clearly didn't disappoint. This soup is the old school ( Gu Zao Wei) traditional taste, very umami and balanced. Prawns & pork are fresh, the sauce is nicely balanced. I love that they put kang Kong for the extra crunch.  Delish!

Fast to cook!

They sell many things besides fishball noodles , there's Laksa and Nasi lemak, otah too.

Recommend prawn noodles! Will be back try the others."
"Good bowl of mee pok in Marine Parade Hawker Centre. The hawker centre was lacking a good mee pok stall and now it finally has one.

This stall move from the nearby Brunners Coffeeshop where I have had their mee pok previously. Took the $4.5 version of mee pok.

Nice, springy noodles. The chilli was good, but not spicy. I would say portions are generous with sliced pork, fishballs and a medium sized prawn."
"I came before the peak hrs before 6 pm and only has one customer in front of me.  I ordered the 6 dollars kuay tiao fish ball soup.  The ingredients are fresh.  And most importantly, the prawn was served deveined.  I think 4.50 will not get you a prawn.  The soup was rather bland.  Not the best fish ball soup I have eaten.  Quantity was average.  But six dollars is rather pricey.  There was only two fish balls I think. Other ingredients include a dumpling and fish cakes.  The man at the stall has a serious scary look but I guess that is his style.  Can be quite intimidating but I noted his regulars would chat with him"
Decent mee pok.
Best bah Chor Mee. It used to be at the the previous coffee shop and my family and I had been patronizing this noodle stall for 14 years. And still enjoying it at their new stall at the market.
"Mee pok tasted decent, rmb to taste better. Friendly owner taking orders. Queued for abt 30mins with 6 pax in line."
"To me, this is the best mee pok in Singapore. Even better, go for the kway teow mee dry. It's a very old-school taste which is hard to find in Singapore these days. Fish balls are fresh and bouncy. I usually order the $7 portion."
I have eaten this when they were at Jago. Very decent bowl of mee pok. But the quantity is quite miserable for the price. The otah is quite nice.
Taste normal only but long que.. maybe cooks is slow..
0 or even negative stars. The qty is soooooo little and nothing like their pics. No prawn. Noodles also so kiam siap to give! $4.50 leh. Warning everyone to stay away.
"There was a short queue of 6 people that moved really slowly. 22 minutes later, greeted with this sad bowl without any prawns for sgd 4.50.

Truly a sad bowl."
Followed this stall since they were at Brunners Coffee shop.  Absolutely great tasting & flavourful bowl of mee pok.  Recommend to order the medium sized one for max satisfaction!
The portion is small but the ingredients and fishball are fresh. Add an extra otah for a change.
Best teochew mee in Katong. We had their noodles since they were at Brunners Kopitiam. Both the soup and dry versions are good. The laksa is well worth a try as well.
"It is one of my favourite chicken rice in Singapore. The steamed chicken is soft and tender with a nice gelatinous layer under the chicken skin. The rice is fragrant and flavourful.  The chicken rice comes with a  complimentary big bowl of peanuts and lotus soup and also a plate of pickled vegetables. The sourness of the pickled vegetables helps to cut through the oil of the chicken, making the meal more enjoyable."
"We paid just over $18 for a set of chicken thighs and drumsticks for two, which came with two bowls of soup and achar.

The chicken was impressively thick and cooked to perfection--tender, juicy, and flavorful. The rice deviates slightly from the typical chicken rice style, though whether that's a good or bad thing might come down to personal preference. As for the chili, it's decent but doesn't particularly stand out. Fortunately, the chicken itself shines so much that you won't miss the chili--it's that good on its own.

One pleasant surprise was the achar. It was exceptionally fresh and well-marinated, with a nice balance of sweetness and tang. From the crunchy pineapples to the zesty onions and chili, everything tasted crisp and vibrant--perhaps the clearest and freshest achar I've ever had. The soup also adds value, and it's worth noting that the options change daily, which keeps things interesting.

Do note: the coffee shop itself is rather quiet, with only 2-3 stalls operating (including the drinks stall). That said, it still draws a strong crowd during peak hours, so it's best to arrive early if you want to beat the rush."
I have wanted to try this place since Covid hit Singapore. The amount of meat given was generous. I especially appreciated it when they don't smash the chicken. But I was not sure why the chicken was served cold. The meal came with a bowl of Lotus root peanut soup and Acar. The place was a little shabby but good enough.
"We got the two portion with the oyster vegetables.

The set comes with soup and assorted vegetables. Lotus soup was generous and hearty with lotus roots and chunks of meat in it.

Chicken was tender and juicy, with the chili complementing it well.

Good plate of chicken rice but we wait around 45 mins for it. Finding seats was also a challenge."
Solid chicken rice but the soup doesn't do it for me
Excellent chicken rice..chicken is tasty. Rice is fragrant. Chicken feet is great. Soup is great. Awesome
"After so many years, the chicken rice still taste amazing.

All these for $16.40"
Yummy chicken rice. Excellent rice
"Min $7.70 per order.  It serve with breast with rice, ahcha and soup.  Too big portion for me.  ahcha is nice.   The Chicken and rice so so."
"was actually looking forward to finally trying out the OG after a really great experience at the other KTMW outlet but was left disappointed.

there was a 30 minutes wait time on a sunday afternoon which is usually okay for me if the food is good. despite the quite generous serving of chicken, the rice was tasteless and kinda dry.

the experience was made worse with the rude aunty taking our orders.

i'd say it is pretty value for money given the serving size with achar and soup, but not worth a travel down especially with the waiting time."
Used to be good but the chicken rice now need a lot improvements ; rice is tasteless sometimes ok but still below standards ; chicken definitely is tasteless and even I order the thigh it is still tough ; wonder what happen so given three chances and in the mean time I won't visit for awhile ! Soup is good and is free but I come here for chicken rice not Tun Tang; u all can try and will know what I mean
"The chicken rice was $8, came with achar and soup. One of the best I've had! The chicken was incredibly tender, and the rice was fragrant and full of flavour."
"The chicken was really succulent, full of flavour, and so tender. The soup was a little too peppery, but the rest of the ingredients (the vegetables and bean sprouts) made up for it"
Average chicken rice with a bad attitude cashier
An institution. For my money - the best chicken rice in Singapore. Bar none
"NGL this is my all time, all Singapore, all world wide favourite chicken rice stall. Free soup and achar. Fragrant rice and pungent chili. Amazing delectable and oily chicken. We dream about this frequently and will bear with the long queues happily."
"We ordered the chicken breast with a perfectly cooked egg, and  was impressed by how juicy, tender, and boneless it was. The fried garlic on top made every bite extra flavorful.

We were also pleasantly surprised by the free-flow soup and salad with pineapple, onion, and cucumber. The soup was very peppery, which he enjoyed, though it wasn't quite for me.

A great meal to kick off our trip.

"One of the best Hainanese chicken rice in town. Had a mishap today while buying lunch for the family. Misplaced one of the plastic bags of food. Although it was not their fault, the shop replaced everything in that bag, based on what I said, and refused payment several times. Made my day so much brighter. Certainly my go-to place for chicken rice from now on."
"Cleaner's attitude is quite bad. Probably overworked.
Chicken rice is good."
"I still enjoy this chicken rice a lot but the prices have gone up. 2 pax chicken rice and a plate of tau gay if I remember is $20+? They are however very generous with the soup.

The achar however could've fermented a little longer but this may be difficult given the high volume of customers"
"Have tried a few times. Personally feels that it's over rated.

Chicken nothing special. Pretty normal. Have tried better ones actually. It came with lotsa soya sauce which is good to go with the rice. The achar is nice thou. Actually I don't mind just getting e achar only, so fresh and appetizing. Came with a bowl of soup with cabbage and chicken meat. More to peppery taste. For the rice, like I say, have tried better ones but not too bad cos very strong fragrant. Set for 2 about S$17++."
"Decent chicken rice, but not special. On par with other random chicken rice in Singapore or any other country. The portion is big, we bought the half chicken portion which is 21.80 SGD. The service is quick and efficient, you need to queue around 3-5 minutes to place an order then wait for your number to be called to collect the food.

Taste wise is just normal chicken rice. Chicken is not as tender as I expected, a little bit chewy. Rice is also not too savory.  The outlet is located in a complex where many maid agency offices are, thus not as crowded as other hawker centers."
New tables and chairs. Food is still as good. Will return whenever I am around the area. Have to come early if u want to get a table.
"Bought half roasted chicken 3 rice take away. No achar. Ask for lotus soup charge extra 5.50

Last time lotus soup is free if no achar.

Half chicken 3 rice 25.10
Soup extra 5.50"
Chicken not really that fantastic. If nearby can come down eat if not worth the trip coming down from far.
"Very nice chicken rice spot! Love the soups they serve, and the achar is a nice touch. The rice was a bit dry, but overall, a really good place to enjoy chicken rice."
Rather average chicken rice for double the price. The free cabbage soup tastes better than the main dish.
"Katong Delicious Chicken - u find them at the basement B1 (floor without the lift) with other eatery which is as good. But most people come here for the chicken rice which is good. Service is fast and furious. Come and try as KSC will be enblock soon.
Visited the chicken again Oct 24. Order half white chicken. Still delicious."
Been at Katong Shopping Centre for a long time. Chicken is slways good. Service is fast and efficient. Very generous with their achar and chicken soup
"Chicken was great. Rice a little subpar frankly maybe this is a healthier version, more bland and less oily.
Love the free lotus peanut soup and achar.
Yong tau fu at same coffeeshop was great too."
"Lost its thrill, no longer nice. Used to bring foreign guests here to have a sample at a more ""local"" chicken rice. Now, will avoid as standard dropped alot, its now just simply a very ordinary bowl of chicken rice."
"A long-established hawker. This place has long queues at lunchtime every day.

The delicious Singaporean style chicken rice comes with free soup and some pickles. The roast chicken was especially good."
Food is quite good not the best but quite good. Always a queue. Self service and coffeeshop is small and hard to find readily available seats. Prefer corner shop selling watanhor anyday
"One of the most talked about chicken rice place for locals. Was here around 11.45am on a Friday and just needed to wait 10 mins for my order. Any time later and you will risk a longer wait for table and food.

$7.70 for chicken rice, achar and soup set. Pay extra $1 for egg (find it abit too dry). Rice was flavourful and not greasy, love the achar as its really refreshing. Overall value for money. For small eaters, suggest just getting one more plate of rice and can share the individual serving btw 2 pax."
Price is pretty reasonable as the portion is huge. Chicken meat is tender. Otherwise a very filling meal
"Standard has dropped to disappointing average and pricing has risen to way above average. Not sure if there will be another visit here, given that waiting time for food is about half an hour during meal times. No longer worth the hype it used to deliver."
"The roast chicken is perfectly cooked. Rice a little dry for my taste but otherwise I enjoyed everything. The soup was also a pleasant surprise, not a thin clear soup but robust and  full flavored."
"Katong Mei Wei Chicken Rice is one of those spots that's always buzzing -- and for good reason. The chicken rice is legit. Tender, flavorful chicken, fragrant rice, and that chilli sauce? Absolute fire. It adds the perfect kick without overpowering everything else.

But let's be real -- this place is always packed. Long queues, packed tables, and a bit of a squeeze during peak hours. If you're not a fan of waiting or eating in a super busy spot, this might test your patience.

That said, if you're willing to brave the crowd, it's kinda worth it."
Best sg chicken rice . Damn shiok !
First time trying. One of the better chicken rice I have tried. Reasonable price that comes with a big bowl of cabbage soup and archar 
"Came doing lunch time , Ordering was pretty fast .
Pay then wait for your number . Appreciate the free soup and Ah Char . Portions were generous . The rice itself wasn't was flavorful as I would have liked"
"Came by for lunch just before noon. The stall name has changed, after checking on the web, it is the same stall that has been around for many years. Make your order on the right from the stall helper and collect your ticket. Listen for your number and collect your tray. Order the steam chicken, thigh, upsize.

Along with the chicken, you get a healthy serving of achar, and soup. The memory i had was much better than today. Rice is fluffy, but it lacks flavour. Chilli is not too spicy and well balanced. The unique part of this place for their chicken is they douse the chicken with fried garlic and the sauce. While the sauce is well done, the chicken has been cooked too soft for my liking, a little on the mushy side, not much bite to it. The soup has several additions in it, chicken feet, some pork pieces. I enjoyed the achar the most. Fresh and crunchy."
"Best chicken rice meal in Singapore, hands down. It never fails to bring my spirits up.
1. Get achar
2. Chilli sauce and ginger sauce are perfect
3. Chicken is so tender and melt-in-mouth
4. Rice is the right kind of fragrant
5.The soup is therapy."
So so only....over rated.
"Chicken rice is nice , char siew and roasted pork are so so"
"Food is above average, but it's a 45 mins wait at 2pm on a Saturday. Staff also would not warn you before paying how long the wait is. I wouldn't recommend it cause of the wait, as it's nothing spectacular and the price is also more expensive than others."
"At the recommendation of a friend, I decided to give it a try.

Ordered a plate of roast chicken rice set for $7.70 that comes with: a plate of rice, plate of roast chicken breast meat, plate of achar, and a bowl of lotus root soup. (And I added on a plate of chicken liver @$3.90).

Note: There are two variations of soup, which is dependent on the type of chicken ordered. If you opt for white chicken meat, your soup will be cabbage soup. If it is roast chicken meat, it will be lotus root soup.

Conclusion, i am delighted with the portion/serving. While i wish the rice could have been a bit more fragrant.. nevertheless, overall, this set meal is definitely value for money. Will revisit again."
"Recommended by a friend to go there. Chicken is ok, the chilli sauce is not the best we have tried. But the free soup with peanuts, lotus, chicken feet and pork is so so delicious! The portion is big and ingredients are plentiful. There are a lot of people queuing up. We placed our order at 12:31 pm and eventually got our food at 1:12pm.  A long wait, and I think worthy of the wait for the soup alone."
"Delicious food.
Free soup (lotus roots & peanut soup )
Free accar "
"One of the better chicken rice stall in SG, however, their price is increasing at alarming rate, $43 per chicken!!!
Do take note that you have to find your seats and clean the table before your meal.
Although the taste is still ok, but I don't have the 'wow' factor like before anymore."
"Good and affordable chicken rice, portion is generous."
Went at 11am for a standard plate of white chicken rice. End up the chicken meat was served cold from the fridge.! They prepared the white chicken overnight and kept on the fridge! Nothing fantastic about the chicken just that people gave  good reviews because of the free soup and vegetables (A-cha) toppings given free.
"One chicken rice stall to eat in SG. Comes with pineapple, cucumber, carrot & onion salad and cabbage soup."
"$8 for individual portion of chicken thigh with rice, soup and achar. Makes for a pretty good and filling meal!"
Picture speaks volume of the food quality. We finished everything
"This stall is located in a food court at the basement of Katong Shoppinh Center. Almost all customers are having chicken rice from this stall.

I ordered half a chicken for our party of 4 people. I asked for it to be half white poached chicken and half roast chicken, which allowed me to have 2 flavors. The chicken is juicy and tender. They are generous with the soy sauce that is poured over the chicken before serving. It's then topped with deep fried garlic pieces and coriander.

Towards the bottom of the chicken plate, it can get salty.

They provided:
- free cabbage soup and
- fruit salad, which had cut pineapples, cucumber and carrots.

They have dark soy sauce, chilli dip and minced ginger dip to go with your chicken rice.

Recommended!

"Que was hella long, but they utilize a cue number system so no worries of standing in line to wait for your turn.

The lotus soup is very flavourful.
Achar is tasty.
Roast chicken also quite tender.
Roast meat not as crunchy as I wanted.
Rice is more mild in taste to accompany the more salty chicken sauce."
Getting expensive
"Chicken rice charging GST in a hawker centre!?!?! $8.50 after GST for a plate of chicken rice!??!!?! $43 for a whole chicken.

This is daylight robbery.

Let me put it out here first, I have eaten this chicken rice since 2015 and it was really good last time. Free flow achar and soup, so value for money when it was $32 for a whole chicken in 2018!

During Covid, some other owner took over. This chicken rice became so bad. It used to be cold and refreshing. But now room temperature and not satisfying at all. no more lotus root soup too (which was tHE BEST btw)

I'm back in 2025, and the price skyrocketed. It's really not worth the price now. And the food court, tho air conditioned, is very packed and average cleanliness.

I don't think it's worth the visit anymore. If the taste had been maintained maybe I wouldn't mind paying absurd price once in a while. But since the taste is so average, like a normal chicken rice, there really is no reason to come back."
Bustling indoor food court with most people coming for the chicken rice. Generous portion and comes with free achar and soup. We waited for 45mins on a weekend lunchtime. Order queue move pretty fast tho.
"One of my favourite chicken rice places. I will highly recommend if you are in the area. It can be quite crowded during lunch time.
I like that the roasted chicken is sprinkled with deep fried shallot bits and the food portion is very generous. Every order comes with free achar and soup (two types of soup: veg or lotus root).
You can skip the charsiew and roasted pork."

"One of my go to chicken rice places. One of the top few in Singapore for sure. Not the very best but still highly recommended. Each meal comes with an either a cabbage or peanut soup that has been simmered for hours so it's super homely and tasty. Their ah zhar is extremely fresh and appetizing too, by the way it's refillable!! I prefer the roasted over steamed chicken and the soy sauce for the chicken is yummy too, and the fried garlic chips??? What a cherry on top. The fruit juice stall in that coffee shop is great too, give it a try!"
"Overall its decent plate of chicken rice. I ordered thigh chicken but when I started eating, I notice half of my chicken is mixed with breast meat

Chicken : 2.5 / 5
It has that nice fat gelatin under the skin, and thigh meat is decent tender, it's just that they sneak in breast meat when I ordered thigh meat.

Soup : 3.5 / 5
Definitely a good bowl of hearty soup

Archar: 1 / 5
Im not sure what they trying to do here, cos it's all big chunk of pineapple, onions and cucumber and it really feel like they are lazy to cut smaller piece to make into archar. And it also doesn't taste like archar, just a mixture of all ingredients into salad? *shrugs*

For the price, and what I am getting, I don't think it is worth the price and definitely not worth travelling there just for a plate of chicken rice.
====================

Reply to owner's response:
Totally my bad, I did not know we could move the chicken piece in the photo to check there is no breast meat.
and also maybe its my 1st time eating chicken , that i do not know how to differentiate between Thigh meat and breast meat.

It's all good.."
Super Yummy
Portion size is big. Comes with soup with ingredients and achar. Overall is great value and very satisfying meal.
"The best chicken rice i ever had.

Chicken rice, chicken is very very tender, and meaty. The sauce is delicious as well, mix it with fried garlic, spring onion and its completes the dish. Don't forget to get chilli and other condiments in the stall.
You get herbal soup for free, soup is tasty.

Overall, food is very delicious. Definitely recommended. However the wait is long, when i came there all the tables are eating chicken rice eventhough there are other food stall."
"Best chicken rice in terms of food quality, presentation and quantity. Super affordable

Seller is very generous with serving even for the garnishes. Archar and boiled soup is on the house too. Can never find such service in sg anymore."
Good but not the best in the neighbourhood
Probably the best chicken rice in the East of Singapore
"Super tasty meal
Lots of great choices
Price is perfect
Chicken is well cooked
Additional vegetables inside dishes are perfect mix
Must try in Singapore

Come early .

"One of the best chicken rice spots in Singapore, with extra points for their soup alone.

The chicken-tender. The rice-flavourful. And the chili? A perfect accompaniment. The only downside was that the sauce was a tad bit too sweet for my taste."
Chicken and rice very mediocre. Actually the rice without condiments can't finish one plus a little uncooked. Saving grace is the condiments and soup.
The chicken is soft and tender. Chicken rice lacked the aroma. Garlic chilli is spicy and blend well with the rice. The achar is Superb & Mouthwatering. Portion is reasonable. Thumb up. Overall - Can eat.
Hugely popular with the people living in this area. Be prepared to fight for seats and wait at least 15-30 mins for your order. Generous portion of soup and pickles. The fried garlic adds a nice toasted aroma to the chicken rice. Had the boiled chicken and it was smooth and succulent.
Not bad really
"The steamed chicken is undoubtedly the star of the meal - soft and tender. Topped with a sauce that delivers a balanced combination of saltiness and a hint of sweetness. The chicken rice set comes with achar, a vegetable pickle, and a simple cabbage soup. However, the rice falls short lacking the fragrance and richness typically associated with classic chicken rice. Come for the chicken, but manage your expectations for the rice."
Awesome chicken rice and accompanied by complimentary achar & soups (peanut-lotus roots-pork & cabbage). We order half roasted and half steamed chicken & 4 rice for $48 & if is the most satisfying meal I had in a long time!
"Katong Mei Wei serves one of the best Chicken Rice in SG 

The succulent meat with the addictive soy sauce is so good and when paired with rice and garlic chilli, makes for a satisfying bite They also give complimentary soups and achar for a complete meal.

While its not cheap, it certainly makes for a hearty weekend treat! Do expect a snaking queue on weekends ~"
"Came at 3pm on a weekday now crowd serve very quickly porkrib and lotus soup excellent lots of sides like archar not found in most chicken rice stores.
Rice is cooked differently more yellow colour the cabbage soup is not as good abit too peppery but the rest worth your time and money"
"I love it, one of the best chicken rice in Singapore. Chicken is good, soup is good , rice is good, and free acar "
"This meal cost $7.70, which I feel is a reasonable amount. There was rojak which contains a lot of pineapples. It was an appetiser. The soup was peppery and the chicken was tender even though it was breast meat. The one serving of chicken was rather big. I was not able to finish my food."
"Cashier said it's boneless drumstick when i ordered 6 boxes of takeaway. Brought home , found out it's cut into few pieces with bones and not even nice and very dry. I guess to speed up the work flow, they don't remove bones. Disappointed with it's service and food"
Came on PH lunch and got my food really quickly. $7.70 chicken rice set that comes with achar and soup. Very value for money! I was hoping there was more flavour for the yellow rice though. Overall a good lunch :)
"Steamed  chicken, rice
achar achar, chicken peanut soup ( free items )
Yummy yummy "
"This spot serves some of the best local chicken rice and is a hidden gem for chicken rice enthusiasts.

Both the white and roasted chicken are incredibly tender and juicy, and the complimentary soup and acar add the perfect finishing touch to the meal.

It's easily one of the best chicken rice experiences I've had in Singapore!"
"I had the chicken rice here, and while it was good, it wasn't exactly mind-blowing. Be prepared to queue, especially during peak hours. The prices are a bit higher than average, but they do include lotus root chicken feet soup and a-char, which is a nice touch.

The steamed chicken was tender and juicy, but the rice was a little on the harder side and lacked the fragrance you'd expect from a great chicken rice. The chili was spot on, not too spicy but with just the right kick.

The real highlight was the complimentary soup--it was absolutely delicious and definitely elevated the meal.

Overall, I'd be willing to try again, but only if there's no queue."
uncle very friendly . Food very nice . Chicken very good
"Never have I had raw chicken served to me before and this place really traumatised me.
Not just raw chicken, but also hair and some other dirt stucked with the hair in the vegetable. It's my second time here and I'll never be back Can't believe we had to fight for a table, waited 20mins for our food to come and then have such an undesirable dining experience.

Staff did not even apologise and doubted us until we asked her to try cutting the chicken apart. The second replaced plate of chicken also had some raw parts.

The only saving grace is probably the huge serving of peanut soup and ginger sauce. You can get better chicken rice at any other coffeeshop."
"dined in, had some portion of chicken that was raw! The lady at the stall denied it's raw at first, then she took a closer look and admitted it's still raw! She exchanged one portion but it is still unbelievable they are serving raw chicken!"
"Not as good as it used to be. Houseflies flying around achar and chicken and staff didn't care about it. Poor service at ordering counter. Business is too good for them to care about service. Auntie can't be bothered to entertain any customisation. Price is too expensive for chicken rice. Chicken rice for one, plus egg plus liver $10.10."
I would have been able to enjoy the chicken if it was cooked. I'm shocked
"The roasted chicken that I ordered was very good. Achar was also excellent. However, the rice was very disappointing, as it lacked fragrance. To make matters worse, I don't understand why their soup is so peppery, which covers any fragrance of its rice, if any. A solid 3-stars but not 4-stars for sure."
"If you like gravy/sauces, type of chicken rice, then this is for you.

1. Too much sauce and fried garlic overpower the chicken taste. Recommended to have it aside instead of pour or splash it on the chicken

2. Yellow rice, hmm bot sure if it is turmeric rice or yellow due to the chicken oil? However, the aroma is not there. But the texture is prefect cooked.

3. Achar is not given to us, hence can't comment.

4. Love the home cook taste lotus soup. Felt warm.

5. Cashier a bit fierce at 1st, maybe due to busy ordered. However, she is kind and gentle if you speak to her a bit more.

We had better kammpung chicken else where before. Hence, this did not meet our top list. Can try if you happen to be nearby, but not worth the trip to travel all the way down. For us, we won't bother to Q if more than 10mins waiting time."
"Nestled in the bowels of Katong Plaza is this chicken rice gem. Tried both the roasted and the white chicken, but the white chicken is best. Flesh is soft without completely texture less. Still smooth and silky. Half chicken is generously portioned. Comes with Achar, which is a favourite. It's like a lightly pickled pineapple salad. Delicious. So good I ordered twice in two weeks."
Best chicken rice in SG.
Super hidden gem! The taste is the best chicken rice I have tried in SG in 2024. It is rather crowded at noon.
"Sunday, 2:30 pm and 30-40 orders ahead of us, I'm guessing it's the late lunch crowd after Church.

Ok, the 1/2 chicken portion looks huge (with loads of cucumber  at the bottom), came free was a big bowl of peanut/ lotus root soup.

Taste wise (to me), it's the average Singapore chicken rice standard.. but seems good value for money  for the size of the portion and ""freebies"".

The best thing about today's lunch was discovering the tze char stall next door! Yue Guang He was very good, will come back for that instead."
"Came on a Sunday at around 2:15pm - place was packed and we had to wait a bit to get table.

Almost every table was eating the chicken rice and being FOMO, we also ordered.

For a roast chicken, I have had better ones (like even Kampung Chicken) elsewhere, the rice was not as fragrant and it comes with a yellow tinge.  We ordered a small portion of chicken liver - they don't remove the bits that most chicken stall would and I suspect they literally take the whole liver and chop into large chunks.

They sprinkle the chicken w fried garlic bits hence for those that enjoys a bit of crunch - it will be nice.  The free salad is okay and refreshing but the peanut soup pretty tasteless and the peanuts were not soft enough (I guess it's free so I cannot expect much)"
Very expensive
"Saw a youtube vid and had to checkout on my trip to SG. Freaking awesome steamed chicken rice, including some char sieu=$9.90sgd.  Not into chicken rice, but this is better than i expected. The pickle dish is pretty good. Really enjoyed the meal!"
Hasn't been to Katong Shopping Centre for years. I grew up in this area. The chicken rice is amazing and very tasty.
Generously huge portion and delicious
Great salade. Soup was an unexpected addition and it was good.
"If it's your first time to try chicken rice, I would suggest to eat here. Order the half steam chicken for the full authentic experience. The chicken is full of flavor and sooooo juicy!! The rice is close to perfection!

+++++ for the location inside the mall. You can enjoy the chicken rice without sweating too much."
Food is good and tasty.
" I've eaten at Katong Mei Wei Chicken Rice stall at Katong Shopping Centre several times over the years.

 I always ask for poached chicken breast as I prefer lean meat.   The chicken meat is juicy, tender and succulent.

 Their famous chicken rice itself is infused with loads of chicken stock and ginger, and that makes for a scrumptious & flavourful chicken rice.

 Every plate or chicken rice order comes with a tasty Achar pickles' side dish consisting of cucumber, onions and pineapples in a tangy-sweet sauce.

  This is really one of the better quality chicken rice in Singapore and the long queues at peak hours are a testament to Katong Mei Wei Chicken Rice's popularity."
Good food and reasonable price.
Serves a good plate of chicken rice especially with it's sauce. It's known for its soup and achar as well.
I don't have a habit of wiping my cutlery before use but this time it is too greasy to touch and I had no choice but to wipe these before use.  Waited almost an hour for our order.  The insiders placed their order n then start looking for a seat nearer their queue number.  May be better to order take out
It's over-rated. My house downstairs have better & cheaper. Noticed afew other customers didnt finish the food and disposed it. Maybe the quality has dropped. And the soup is dam peppery
The chicken is really soft and the sauce accompanying the chicken is very umami! Highly recommended if you don't mind paying a little bit more for a good plate of chicken rice.
"Dui Wo Er Yan Zhe Jia Ji Fan De Shui Ping Suan Shi Zhong Gui Zhong Ju,Bu Guo Tang He Ah CharShi Chao Bang De. "
"Went on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. The queue and the wait was crazy...some 1hr10min wait. Food wise was so so, the rice was not fully cooked. Chicken portion was quite big, sauce is too salty to my liking. Achar and soup are good though. Won't recommend due to the crowd and  long waiting time. May be week days is better."
"Was looking for an authentic local Singapore experience and this didn't disappoint.   Had the roasted chicken and rice and it was excellent!  Soups and sides were also good. Not a glamorous place, but it isn't supposed to be.  And they got my food out incredibly quickly. Liked this place!"
"Very good and thick chicken
Generous ah jat"
"Really delicious chicken rice - juicy and silky smooth chicken, fresh oyster sauce veggies, awesome complimentary soups and achar (also complimentary! They're generous). Rice is personally not my favorite but the entire combination is always "
"Ah char & soup were really the plus point ( taste good pretty ). for normal chicken rice in a restaurant setting. Paying for air con and serve to table service.

Ordered a promo set for two and additional small portion gizzard $40 . Gizzard's serving was big thou."
Singapore best chicken rice recommended by local 
"First time trying it. Although a portion cost between $8 to $10, it comes with achar, soup on top of the chicken rice. So it kind of looks impressive and Value for money but a bit too sweet for my liking. Not savoury enough. But the whole coffeeshop crowd is dominated by them. Prepare to wait for 30 mins... if you are not into the the soup and achar, it's like many other chicken rice minus the long wait."
Will miss this chicken rice forever. The best one I had during my stay in Singapore and I ate chicken rice at least once a day :)
"my first time visit this chicken rice stall inside the shopping mall. our boss brought us there and gave us a treat. its a whole chicken, tat was not debone
and able the splitting into 2 plates just nice to share by 6 paxs. the chicken is tender and soft, texture is good. he oso ordered sides as such veggies and roasted pork n char siew. and omg the azchar with huge pineapples ad appetizers and the soup is tasty and flavor. not bad to say...yummy"
The stream chicken is tender and juicy as per what a good chicken should be. Rice is fragrant and nice. Char siew and You Cai is so so.
"The chicken was pretty good -- the sauce and fried garlic complemented the (almost) boneless chicken well.

The reason for 3* for food is because I found the rice itself very mediocre. It lacked the aroma and tastiness one would expect from chicken rice. It was also mushy in my opinion, would have been better if slightly more al dente or if the rice wasn't ""broken"".

Most of the tables there were empty and waiting 1h each for their orders. I believe a 1h wait time for food is quite ridiculous, especially if it's not due to it taking long to cook. Everything is prepared hence it's just due to the lack of manpower to speed up the food being served."
"Had this during weekdays when there was no crowd, just queue up at the red booth and pay then wait for your number to be called and u collect from the left side. There is no black sauce only chilli. I must say it's overall very delicious worthy of its name. Chicken is fresh and tender and Achar is not the norm for chicken rice but pairs well with the yellowish rice which is a fragrant variant of chicken rice. The soup is nice and has a hint of pork stomach soup peppery taste, with cabbage. No refill for the soup. Overall good place to eat if u crave chicken rice"
"Old school looking coffeeshop. Plus point is that there is A/C and the ventilation is good, so no food aroma stinking your shirt.

Self-service food collection with queue system. Amazing chicken rice."
"Wanna try out the epic banana pie but sold out. I love to reminisce on my childhood and I especially love when I find something that triggers the moment randomly. Went for the ever popular chicken rice which is well known for soft tender chicken, complimentary soup and refreshing achar! Waited for almost an hour with 22 orders ahead of us.  They had a queue number system, along with a speaker sounding out what order was ready for pick up. No hassle. Our order was fabulous with quarter mixed roasted and steamed tender chicken. Added on the refreshing collagen filled chicken feet. Love the complimentary big bowl of chicken cabbage soup infused with lots ginger! All less than $25!  Definitely worth the wait if you are in Katong shopping centre "
"Comfort food. Juicy chicken, and    it goes well with the fried onions and garlic  on top.  The bean sprout is fresh and sweet. Don't forget to try the achar ."
"This chicken rice stall is located in katong shopping plaza, and I feel that people visit this place mainly for the chicken rice. Though it is a stall in a food court, literally everyone was eating only chicken rice and I do wonder how the rest survives. This place always have a long queue. But they have quite a good system with and ordering line and your number will be called out when your chicken rice was ready.

So we ordered the streamed chicken rice (individual portion) and we even added gizzard to one of them. You can choose which part of the chicken you would like and it is priced accordingly. The rice was not as tasty as other famous chicken rice places and it was slightly hard and had some undercooked pieces. The chicken was juicy and oily but once again did not quite hit  the mark compared to others. What was really good though was the soup and acar/pickled vegetables that came with it. They gave us 2 different soups and the soup was filled with ingredients such as chicken feet, lotus roots and peanuts. The serving size was also very generous.

Overall, still a very good chicken rice as shown by the constant queue. I would not go so out of the way and join the queue for this though."
"On Friday, 13 September 2024 evening, I had my early dinner at Katong Mei Wei Chicken rice
I have eaten there a few times . If not for the good food , I would not have my chicken rice there because the cashier has attitude issues. She's curt , rude and trying to be smart Alec when what I wanted was the steam chicken for 2 persons and she curtly said no drumstick and recommend a quarter chicken that come with the chicken drumsticks ( at higher pricing) . I insist on the 2 persons portion  steamed chicken with breast meat ( if no drumsticks).
However when I received the  2 persons chicken , I observed it was the roast chicken and not the steamed chicken. Thankfully the others were ok and  nice and willingly replaced the roast chicken to the steamed chicken . The Mainland Chinese male helper who offered to help carry my tray to my table  was also very polite and cheerful.

The female cashier seemed to be a relative who "" may be forced "" to be the cashier to look after the money , as reviewed by one customer."
"Best Chicken rice in Singapore. Went to many places in Singapore but this place takes the cake. Be careful as they close on Mondays.
Chicken had great texture and was cooked perfectly with a velvety skin. The star of the show and what most places mess up though is the rice. The rice here is fragrant and you can smell the garlic and chicken fat they cook it wirh. You'd be happy to just eat it by itself.
Chicken soup was also not bad as well and not the generic MSG broth that other places did."
"I used to be a regular customer up until 5 years ago before I left Singapore and move back to Europe. Visiting Singapore in September 2024 I was very positively surprised that this chicken rice is still the best in this country!
Chicken meat is juicy and full of flavour, rice is cooked perfectly and together with the chilli sauce complements the taste of the dish. Boiled egg, chicken livers and char siew are not a must but for me it's just a perfect food combo. Complementary soup (peanut for me is much better than the cabbage soup) and salat are the cherry on top of this simple yet amazing meal.
Only downside is the waiting time- nearly 40 minutes on Saturday 2pm. The bright side is that they inform you about the waiting time upfront.
Bottom line - it is THE BEST CHICKEN RICE IN SINGAPORE! "
If only the wait isn't so long.
"The old cashier auntie super rude, food standard also getting worse. Used to visit there regularly on weekends, but never again"
No food is worth the wait of 50mins and the bad attitude the cashier has towards customer
"Ordered two chicken thigh set but yeh cashier seems don't like my order and keep pushing for half a chicken for us.

The rice is broken rice, a little hard to chew.

Queue is super long even after peak hour!

Portion is huge, free soup and pineapple etc. I guess what is what makes it so popular!"
Expect long queue during peak hours especially in the weekends. But all worth with those juicy succulents chicken rice. They give free quality soup! Indeed one of top 3 chicken rice in Singapore imo.
Surprisingly not bad except for the wait time for your order to be prepared...
"Finally able to try what is deemed as the ""Best Chicken Rice in Singapore"" by many. Got to the coffeeshop around 12pm on a weekday, place was packed with almost everyone having the chicken rice.

Ordered half white chicken and 2 plates of rice, amounting to $24. The rice was one of the most flavourful chicken rice I have had. The chicken was really tender as well, with the aspic being present in some parts of the thigh meat. Soy sauce on the plate of chicken is a bit salty, but pairs well with the rice. Fried garlic bits give the dish a nice crunch and elevation of flavours.

Free lotus root soup and cabbage soup came with the set, and the effort put into the soup is evident. Lotus root soup tasted like what people pay to have in soup stalls at the food court, and even came with meat. Cabbage soup did not stand out as much and was a tad bit peppery. Achar was appetising.

The chilli had a nice spicy and garlicky kick, pairing nicely with the chicken.

The coffeeshop was a bit cramped but it is definitely worth heading down to try this chicken rice."
"Need go early before 11am if u plan on weekend.
Expecting long queue
Best chicken rice with cabbage soup n lotus soup.Like the deep fried garlic as condiment to the chicken rice."
"One of the best chicken rice in singapore. Ambience is more hawker stall, non AC but worth it."
Delightfully delicious chicken rice. The chicken is tender and moist not over or under cooked. The chicken sauce they use is very fragrant. Provide free soup. Achar also very yummy. Prolly i rate personally the top 3 chiclen rice in Singapore.  V Highly recommended
"Best chicken rice I've had in Singapore. Quality goes beyond price.
Located in small mall, thus very crowded, you need to wait for an available table at peak time."
"Personal opinion, the last time I came was 2 years back. Back again recently.

1.) Slightly high price. $7.70 for a basic chicken rice. Mine was $8.20 for drum.
2.) very disappointed. I LOVE the Achar it use to be unlimited but now can't. I expected unlimited achar for this price just like last time.
3.) others got lotus root soup, I got the cabbage soup. Extremely peppery. Sorry way  too peppery for me to accept. I only taste pepper.
4.) No steamed chicken at that point so forced to order roasted. Chicken taste normal. Average.
5.)  rice is ok but not as fragrant as normal chicken rice and additional rice cost $1.10
6.) quite Long waiting time
7.) staff there was quite rude.
8.) gravy is nice but abit salty. I love it some people may find it too salty.

Overall, edible chicken rice but pricey.  3.5 stars. Can come and try if nearby but I won't travel all the way down just for this.

I would give 4 stars+ if i have gotten the lotus root soup, steam chicken and unlimited achar.

Note: please be aware of the soup quantity. It maybe better to order individual plates for more achar and soup then to order 1 chicken."
"The rice is more yellow in colour and flavourful. The food was served fast and we went for dinner at about 7pm. The portion given was generous. I ordered for 2 person. There were pickles which I like and very appetising. It goes well with the food. The soup was so good. Lotus pork ribs with lots of peanut. Soup was rich in taste and we finished the whole bowl. If you love peanuts, you will love the soup. Chicken was very tender and there was crispy garlic on it. Overall it's nice chicken rice worth the try! The chilli and garlic are self service. You can take more if you love the sauce."
"Value for money chicken. The serving is huge for the price. Meat texture is better than most chicken rice stall but not the best which I have tasted. Pickles and soup is good.
The coffeeshop hygiene standards is questionable but understandable if you see the only old ladies doing the cleaning."
Taste average nothing special to me. But at least better than expensive Li Nanxing's chicken rice.
"One of the very good chicken rice in SG, definitely worth to come n try . Chicken is tender n juicy, soup is delicious n tastefully cooked. Beware of the queue , hahaha , long queue is normal n enjoy the meal! Yummy"
Last time used to patronized this stall but after one time I did not go again.All because of the staff not happy about replenish the salad when there is no more.I went there because of the soup and salad but have negative experiences.
"$8 for one portion of chicken thigh, comes with rice/soup/achar. Fast service. Meat is tender and comes with a layer of jelly  portion is slightly more than other stalls. Chicken sauce is on the saltier side. Soup used to be more peppery and has more cabbage, rice that day was mushy on the outside and hard on the inside. Black sauce is thick and not diluted, chilli sauce and ginger sauce pairs really well with the chicken rice. Overall still a decent plate of chicken rice in katong area."
"Ji Fan Hen Pu Tong,Lian Ou Tang Jiu Xiang Jiang You Wei Dao,Wan Quan Bu Shi Tun Tang"
"Chicken rice was average, nothing to complain but also nothing hype about it. Honestly, their servings are rather generous- set meal consists of chicken, rice, bowl of soup and a plate of achar (v generous) but for the price point, if you are only focusing on the chicken rice...perhaps you can get a better tasting one out there without the achar/soup. Also, the cashier seems like he is being forced to be there lol "
"Have long heard about the famous chicken rice at katong shopping centre but did not go as it was just too far for me. And how good could chicken rice be? Finally made my way down when the TEL extension opened. Was hyped when I saw everyone there was basically waiting for or eating the chicken rice.

We ordered a mixed chicken for 2, 2 plates of rice and a plate of medium salted fish bean sprouts. The achar and soup were complimentary. The rice and sauce on the chicken were great! It's heavy and salty but very addictive. I'm usually a white chicken person but their roasted chicken was better.

If you want to come down, I recommend getting more people so you can try more things."
"Char Siew is so-so.
Lotus root peanut soup is pretty good.
Bai Zhan Ji is tender and smooth.
Rice is fragrant and tasty.
Service is fast even though there is a queue in front of me.

Overall is a value for money Chicken Rice but the tables are limited and quite a lot of people visits, so might have to wait a bit for table."
The chicken and achar is da bomb. I prefer the white chicken to the roasted. Chicken feet is also full of collagen and refreshing. Also like that they also have lotus root soup and the achar and soups are all full of ingredients and not just soup water. It's not cheap and what you see in the photos came to $40+ which certainly is expensive for 2 pax. But we were really full to the brim.
Real delicious chicken rice in Singapore.
"This was the third time i have eaten at the shop and the standard has dropped. This time round, the rice was not well cooked , like stone. Disappointed, will not come again."
Price very expensive
"Strongly recommend against takeaways.
The stall specially pack unwanted parts for takeaway, consisting of more than 60% bones. To make it worse it comes with a 7.50 price tag. Totally different when you dine in"
"Hen Hao Chi,Fei Chang Liang Ya Jiang Liao Zhi Lei De Mei You Xian Zhi. 
Hen Ke Xi Wan Can 6Dian Duo Shi,Shao Ji Yi Jing Shou Wan. "
"Food: 3/5
Pricing: 1/5

I'm afraid their standards have dropped too much, and the price just keeps going up. I have been eating here for years and i came often before their price increased. But every time i come back im disappointed.

Ever since they became more popular a few years ago, the price kept climbing but the food got worse and worse.

Now? You frequently get hard rice, stingy chicken portions and everything is marked up. Food wise, because its the sole chicken rice stall for the nearby condos, its still going strong. But my god,  $8 for a regular portion of chicken rice?

If you are willing to walk, go to marine parade food center where the chicken rice is half the price and has fresh rice."
"This chicken rice style is definitely not Hainanese, the rice is yellow but not much fragrant than others, Roasted & White Chicken is average, lacking in juiciness department.
Soup on the other hand is really good and comes with a lot of meat and veggies.
Boneless Chicken Feet is not good, lacks in crunchiness and kinda bland."

Tender and juicy.

Chilie with ginger best blend for chicken."

"I've tasted better rice and chicken so to me what really stood out is the soups, free flow chunky achar where each ingredient tasted so crisp and refreshing and small details like having garlic chips on the chicken!

I think the pork rib soup might only be served if you hit minimum spend as I see most people having only chicken soup which was delicious as well. Roast pork was alright, definitely v meaty and the skin was still crispy.

Side note, also had the laksa at this coffee shop. Was craving curry to have w chicken rice and it was satisfying.

Overall definitely had a good time at a super affordable price poin! Do note that there are limited seats and even at the time when we went about 3pm on a Saturday, it was almost full house w constant inflow of people still. Slight queue for the chicken but I heard during lunchtime the queue is mad and most people would just do take away.

Edit: Super huge and hearty portions with sides and soups always makes this a complete meal worthy for a gathering. Have visited this place numerous times over the years and would still come back!"
"Food was OK but rude cashier had turned me off for the good.  I will not come back anymore.  I had been eating there since 15 years ago but never once was I scolded for taking the sauces before my food arrives. This time after placing our order, i did the same as always, tried to take the dark sauce to chope my seat due to the lunch crowd, I was scolded. People behind me managed to take the sauces and chope the whole table before their food arrived,  yet the lady boss did not stop them nor lecture them.  She only picked on me who is queuing behind a group of guys who are doing the exact same thing too. So may I ask what did I do wrong so she picked only me to ask me to go back to my seat first and the food will be served with the chili and all? I was following what the guys in front me are doing and the ladies behind me also did the same.  None of the groups were scolded by her. I was in between and was picked on by her. Is it because half a chicken Is too small an order? That's why she picked on me. I wanted to go up to her and ask why but my husband told me to go back to the table first.  Otherwise I would have confronted her to ask for the reason..

Best thing was- I have been patronising their stall as I live near by. So is not my first time doing this.

Anyway I told my husband we will never come back again.

A word of advise- a humble hawker with mediocre food sometimes is better received than a rude hawker with highly rated food. Humility goes a long way in life."
"Can eat but just like most average chicken rice, not worth the trip down unless happens to be nearby. No refill for soup, chili lacks the punch imo."
My preferred Chicken rice stall in the area.
"Reasonable prices and generous servings for what you order. The owners tend to give a small plate of achar, a medium/large bowl of chicken+cabbage soup or lotus root+peanut+pork rib soup with any order of their main dishes.

Chicken meat portions are plentiful too, savoury and tender, paired with strong sesame-soy sauces.

Their chicken gizzard/liver dish is also tasty though gizzards can be a bit chewy. Chicken feet skin might interest those who enjoy such exotic parts but they're not well-marinated despite pairing with sweet-soy sauce.

Their char-siew meat is passable, not worth trying as it's not their specialty. Roast pork is a bit better but ultimately, their main draw is their signature Hainanese chicken."
"Excellent chicken rice. We went early to avoid the queue and although pricey, it was worth the amount we paid. Chicken was tender and juicy, even the breast meat. Ordered a side portion of gizzard which was generous for the amount paid. Everything was above average but the standout performance was from the sauce."
Not the cheapest chicken rice but definitely tasty and fills you up as soup and achar were provided within the price you paid for. I added an egg which made my meal $8.70 ($1 for braised egg). Cannot expect great service since it is a no-frills food court setting. Brisk service and I think achar and soup is free-flow. One can choose the parts of the chicken as well. Always patronise this shop and Donna Manis when I'm at Katong/Parkway area.
Awesome taste and reasonably priced.
Succulent juicy cold chicken with old school retro vibes! Probably the best chicken rice I've tasted my entire life goddamn
"In a shady mall, but this might well be one of the best chicken rice in Singapore. I especially enjoy the excellent soups they boil."
well done ! I travelled all the way from cck after recommendation from friends. simply love it
"0024 single pax lunch / $7.70 / showing off with a pic,  my solo lunch.  Considering that the meat portion is larger n with good soup n achar, I think it is still a good deal compared to other places CR at $4.

11.11.23 late lunch / $17 for 2 pax / Order from the lady n given a buzzer n go hunt your own table, which are mostly wet n not clean.  Free small plate of achar n we were given free Cabbage Peppery soup n not Lotus soup, because need to spend a certain minimum ... Overall,  a nice meal as chicken was tender n goes well with the garlic crisps. Soup was just as good. I think of it often "
"Chicken is OK.

Note that Rice is purchased separately from chicken. Rice is subpar - my kid says ""Taste like normal rice with yellow color"".

Service subpar:-

Soup is nice, but only provided one small bowl for three persons. Refused to provide additional bowls when requested.   Told us the soup is ""free"" so they don't need to give.

Price is on the high side, but it's ok to pay for quality, unfortunately failed to meet expectations for the higher price.

For the price charged and attitude regarding the ""free"" soup, give one star.

Seems over rated. Not going to visit again.

I tried this so you can save yourself the trip and parking."

"This place gives out gourmet chicken rice. A very unique and weird feeling indeed. I've never seen a chicken rice comes with high quality soup + chicken feet(really soft!) and picked sides.

White chicken rice (Thigh) + gizzard + extra serving of rice. ($10.50)

The rice was a good foundation that felt a little less seasoned than average.

The gizzard was not to standard as some had inedible bones. Thankfully they gave a substantial amount to offset the bad actors.

The white steamed chicken lives up to the stalls name. Cold and jelly like that have a mouthfeel of silky tofu. Coupled with the rich umami sauce, it's a mouthwatering experience coupled with the rice.

Now all this cannot be elevated to the next level without a good chilli, and thankfully they have it down too. It's spicy, full of flavour and the right ratio of salty and tangy. A good chilli always have the umami from msg, a crippling addictiveness that makes you yearn for more. I think they added ginger inside too because my tongue started to hurt after adding the extra ginger they gave.

You bet I got another plate of rice even from a single plate of white steamed chicken thigh.

People think this is expensive for chicken rice but people don't understand it's rare to get chicken rice like this.

I must have came at non peak hours because my order came immediately on a Thursday afternoon. The only gripe I have about this place is that the environment feels a little claustrophobic and moldy, like a basement."
Can comment more. One of the best I have eaten.
Very crowded but good chicken rice and soup of the day
"Best chicken rice i've had here (i'm Singaporean). the amount of free sides that come with your order is INSANE, and delicious at that. the chicken is tender and flavorful, the rice is so fragrant and yummy. IT'S GREAT"
"Sometimes it seems as though rude service is a trade off to be expected if you want good food to be served, except that this time round the cashier is rude but the food just isn't that good. (P.S the collection experience is actually quite good though. Fast and steady)

I really wanted to like this because I did many years back, but somehow this time round I can't seem to like it; something feels lacking. I enjoy the chilli and ginger with the rice (which is light fluffy and not too greasy), but the chicken is dry and plain, even with the garlic crisps and the (somewhat oily) sauce accompanying it.

Overall It's nice that the set comes with refreshing achar and soup (probably the reason why crowds flock over), but taste wise it's just not as hearty as one would expect from such a combo."
"To me the thing that stands out was the soup. The soup was delicious with peppery notes. The chicken was okay but the sauce is a bit too salty. I prefer the chicken rice at Yishun. The low star was due to the queue, rude cashier and price increase. Drumstick rice $8.2, half a chicken $21.9!"
It's one of my comfort food. Been supporting them for coming or over 20 years.
"Ordered roasted chicken rice plus eggs for $8.70. The chicken is tender and rice is fragrant. The set comes with a peppery soup and a plate of appetising salad. The taste is delicious and very fulfilling. Value for money, totally worth it."
"First return post-Covid. It's an experience I feel myself going back in time.  The food was good  (soup was excellent the chicken and pork good, archar has declined) the service style annoying (computerized bell plus number loudly voiced plus number illuminated on board ... like eating in post office)
Yes, I'd bring out of town friends but I can't see myself returning regularly"
Super rude service by the lady with blonde hair at the cashier. It is as if customers owe her a living.
Situated at the basement of katong shopping centre. The coffeeshop is pretty packed and almost 90% of the customers is eating this chicken rice. Very long queue but they clear the queue pretty fast as 1 guy taking order and collect payment then wait till your queue no to be called. Portion is huge to justify for the price $7.70 for the chicken breast. Is a little bit pricey but once in a while is fine.
$7.70 for a Michelin Star Chicken Rice. Totally satisfying 
Great roasted chicken
"Not to be confused. It's located at the other end of a newly renovated foodcourt

I ordered an single served white /steamed chicken rice. It comes with generous portion, acar and soup.

Chicken is tender and soft.

Rice ok."
"Chicken is good, as usual. Fragrant & enjoyable. Love their home made achar, crunchy and sweet. Great to have a warm bowl of vegetable soup."
"Might be my favourite chicken rice. Rice is fragrant and moist, although the last time I visited (in March 2024), the rice wasn't as fragrant (and yellow). Really love the fried garlic and cabbage soup here too. Service can be a hit-or-miss as the one taking your order can seem rather annoyed to be there."
"chicken sauce was truly amazing
and chicken was good and fatty and juicy
the free soup was herbalicious
don't know why our free soup was different from everyone else
achar was good
rice was normal
aunty thought she gave me 3 cutlery, but gave 2 cutlery, then sus me when I ask for one more
mild aircon
siobak is mid"
Katong Delicious Chicken Rice is truly Delicious!
Every element on the plate was worth it. Can't ask for more for a hawker food
Too expensive
Still goat tier
"Went to see the hype. Not very worth it. The rice was tasty, but the steamed chicken was cold. I had ordered chicken thighs. The soup was good, it had chicken bones in it, but lacked salt. Not worth $8. The best were the vegetables."
Good chicken rice. One of the .ain reasons to go to Katong is for their roasted Chicken.
One of the better chicken rice in Singapore.
"This chicken rice place is quite famous among its neighbourhood for sure and is an anchor stall for holding the crowd to this basement B1 coffeeshop at Katong shopping centre! Got to queue for a while and after trying this place for so long, I must say their steamed white chicken is far better than their roast chicken.

Half roast chicken, Gizzard, two eggs and two rice cost $29+ (with free soup and Azar given), is of course a bit expensive for hawker dining. But the standard is there so I will still return for sure. I really love that fried garlic covering the chicken as it gives the meal an added punch to the taste. Rice is fragrant and the chili mix is fantastic. Their soup of the day (provided foc) is not those msg soup and we had lotus pork ribs soup that day when we dined in there. Gizzard is awesome too! But yes please order steamed white chicken. I was a bit disappointed when they told me their white chicken is sold out by 6pm ;("
"Definitely my new go-to chicken rice place!
$23 for everything that you see on the pics... It's literally good for 3pax but was superb full for 2pax."
"Pros: Portion is big, air-conditioned, peanut soup was good with loads of peanut & meat

Cons: Chicken was dry, not tender. Not boneless. About half of the chicken had bones in it. WAY TOO SWEET. Everything from the chicken feet, achar to the chicken itself, i got sick of the sweet taste and couldnt finish it. Achar had no pickled taste, all i could taste was sugar.

Probably those who grew up eating this are the ones finding it to be the best in Singapore, My favourite is still Yishun 925/Feng feng chicken rice.

Damage: $21.70 For 2 Adults (+Chicken Feet)"
"Rice = 5 out of 5! Fragrant. Can eat without the chicken
Chicken = 3 out of 5. Have to say not the steamed chicken I've had.
Chili = 5 out of 5. Spicy enough

The best item on the table was actually the soup! It was made with peanuts, lotus, chicken feet & pork belly. Too bad we couldn't ask for seconds but they gave a hearty bowl 

Will be back definitely "
"Pretty good chicken rice that's been here for many years, comes with achar and a better-than-usual soup. Not cheap though, for me personally, I need to upsize, which brings the cost up to $10.90! Though it is quite a complete meal."
"Overall not a good experience. I can't believe chicken meat is cold (not room temperature cold but fridge kind of cold). I am not sure is it just happened to be the chicken they serve to me or it is normal as I don't see any review about other people mentioning the meat being cold. The free peanut lotus soup and pineapple salad are nice though. The place itself doesn't have any people wipe table, basically we have to wipe ourselves."
"Great food, great ambience. Besides the steam chicken, the sides are very nice and tasty too."
"Used to be my family favorite chicken rice stall. Price was more expensive than others which was expected, n though archar is free flow, was disappointed they no longer allow soup refill n the peanut lotus soup was no longer available, only hv the cabbage soup which was still tasty but the unavailable peanut soup was better.  In the past, they will give 2 diff soups. Not sure why they stop refilling soup n was definitely not enough to fully enjoy the meal with one bowl. With tis new no refill practice, hv to control drinking t soup, not shiok anymore. ALSO sensed some arrogance with the service like the past but used to overlooked tis as it was really shiok to eat here then, now it is not compelling to eat here often considering the higher than normal price n lesser soups option n no refills. FYI 1/2 ~$22, whole ~$43....  photo was for 2 paxs portion, -$19 plus gst. Left unsatisfied with today meal."
One of the more expensive chicken rice set I have ever eaten.  The standard chicken rice is priced at 7.70 as dated 14 Mar 2024.  I visited 2 plus in the afternoon.  The white chicken is nice and tender.  The archar salad is nice with pineapple.  Cabbage soup is flavourful too.  Chilli sauce packs a punch.  However the rice is a disappointment as it is not fully cooked with many hard bits.  I believe this may not be the case all the time but I don't know.  This is the first time I patronised.  For this reason I rated this with reduced stars.
"To be honest, for the price point, you can get better tasting chicken rice in traditional food centres. Only thing is the free lotus root soup that comes with it. Not worth the long wait, and the dated food court have limited seats."
Sometimes went there for lunch or dinner during weekends or PH. Like the archar and soup. The meat /sauce was nice  as well as the rice. price still affordable.
"Chicken was tender and juicy however rice was not fragrant(even though its yellow colored but there was no tinge of ginger taste)
Paid $46 for whole chicken and wanted an extra bowl of soup but the uncle rejected with hostility. I think i still prefer supporting local hawker than this over the service, taste, value for money and not so obnoxious too."
"Food is great! My favorite chicken rice! But it has gotten really expensive so I don't go here very much anymore. The soup and achar are also no longer free flow. Also, it's a hit or miss. Sometimes I come and there's no chicken left even though it's only 530pm. Sometimes I can't even find a seat to eat. Not worth coming all the way with the price, space, and unpredictability."
"Beware and check the cost. Not worth it. Wanted to eat the Yong Tou Fu actually but was closed so went for the chicken rice. Caught by surprised a plate of chicken rice cost $7.70
Quite some time did not eat this stall but was never that expensive. Soup also bad. Used to be better. Pepper soup"
"Excellent chicken rice.
Chicken is succulent, but the best part is their rice. Fluffy and fragrant, nice ginger flavor. I think their rice is the best part.
Soup was quite spicy, lots of white pepper. It was too spicy for my liking.
All in all, highly recommend."
"Eatery is located in a food court. I was Initially taken aback by the price because $8 for steamed thigh rice is considered pricey to me. Just to clarify, I did not research, neither do I know about this place beforehand. The crowd is crazy? There were at least 20 orders (mostly more than 1 plate per order) ahead of me at on a Sat at 3PM!

After I got my food, I was shocked by how sumptuous the meal was! $8 for not just the steamed thigh rice (not to mention the portion is bigger than typical chicken rice for both meat and rice), but Achar (sweet and mildly-spicy pickled vegetables, as well as soup of the day.

In short, my meal was balanced wholesome! If you fancy sweet desserts, you may try the Nona Manis just few stores away!"
"Food is not bad, but i have no idea why i was charged 61 bucks for the following. 1 whole chicken, 1 plate of chicken feet, 1 plate of chicken liver, 1 small plate of veg, 6 rice. Could be an honest mistake on their part but please check before paying.

Updated: rude and snobbish behavior from the old lady at the counter, and now they start charging for soup and acar even though their chicken rice is already more expensive than others around the area. Downgrading to 1 star."
"I'm doing a comparison this time. My dad brought me here and there was already a long queue. As a stereotypical singaporean, of course queue means good.
Wait time: 2/10 45 minutes went there on a sat 3pm and it was so crowded. The wait time better be worthwhile.
When the food was served, I personally prefer the dff chicken rice at ghee moh. The chicken was very flavourful juicy especially the roast chicken. The steamed one was slightly more bland.
To truly have a whole experience eating chicken rice, the rice has to be on point. The rice here is not as flavourful as DFF (ghee moh) and a bit on the blander side.
Personally to wait this long for a chicken rice that is slightly above average, I would say find another place. This place also a bit expensive the ghee moh one is better and more affordable."
The coffee shop has limited seating. Chicken rice is not fantastic and the best part is the place is so cramped that you won't be able to enjoy your meal there.
"Indulge your taste buds in a culinary masterpiece at this hidden gem! The chicken rice at Katong Mei Wei Boneless Chicken is an absolute must-try for any food enthusiast. From the moment you take your first bite, you're greeted with the enticing aroma of fragrant rice, perfectly complemented by tender, succulent chicken. But it doesn't stop there - the generous serving of achar adds a delightful tangy kick that elevates the dish to new heights. Each component harmonizes seamlessly to create a symphony of flavors that leave you yearning for more. Whether you're a seasoned foodie or just looking for a satisfying meal, Katong Mei Wei Boneless Chicken delivers an unforgettable dining experience that will keep you coming back for more!"
Cash only.
"The older lady at the counter was super rude and fussy. All I simply asked was "" hello aunty sorry ah how long is the queue ?"". Her response was a very heavy sigh followed by an eye roll and then "" CANNOT BE SO FAST ONE LA !"" The standard of the chicken rice dropped significantly and also the service is below acceptable"
"Saw so many good reviews and many people eating there, so decided to tabao. The cashier aunty had a bad attitude. I ordered 1 pack, then asked if I could add achar. She probably didn't hear me the first time and asked me ""how many packs??"" with a scowl.

The chicken came with bones (does the shop name not say boneless?). The yellowish rice was somewhat sweet. And, there was no achar. The chicken meat was decent.. but, I've tasted better elsewhere, without the high price tag and bad attitude. The price of $7.70 is not worth it in my opinion.

I doubt I would be going back again."
"My favourite place with my son. Love chicken rice, feel with tradition way. Heart work."
"The chicken and rice was moist and fragrant

Portions are also pretty generous

Pickled side dish was the only let down

It's a small basement hawker with limited tables so go early to find seats"
Fast moving queue. Free soup and achar. What more can you ask for? Excellent
"One of the best chicken rice, portions are generous, with really good soup!"
Best chicken rice!!!! There's something about the fragrant yellow rice paired with the sauce that soaks the chicken 
Some say this is the best chicken rice in SG
Good Chicken
"In a food court basement of Katong Shopping Centre. Small and noisy.
Self service style; queue to order , number flash on screen to collect.
Food great!"
"Above average chicken rice for sure, nice portion of meat and all. Rice was nice and fragrant but the cheapskate Singaporean in me does find $7.60 still too steep even for the quality and portion size.
Sauce for chicken is on the sweeter side and the rice seem to be inconsistent on occasions(both my pictures have different colored rice?!)
Definitely more worth to dine in than takeaway, as you get to pay a little more for more variety of items such as the peanut soup, achar, beansprouts & chicken feet which i enjoyed better than the actual chicken rice."
"Portion is acceptable, little more expensive as they give free soup & achar. Today's soup was the lotus root peanut soup, tasted sweet in a weird way, not recommended. The usual chicken veg soup is way much better.

The fresh crunchy achar is not given if order online; given reluctantly after asked. Paid for another box, the cashier tilted it when passing to us; spilling some of the water to the floor.

Disappointed with the service today (unlike previous times with the young boss); a reluctant feeling was felt overall from the person serving us. Surprised to discover that we need to request for boneless when we didn't had to say so last year.

Food tasted alright, there are better chicken rice stalls than this. The 3 stars' rating is given mainly because they give out hearty chicken veg soup and crunchy fresh achar for free. It is hard to come back if the service doesn't improve "
food was great!! portion was huge. Staff were very friendly and helpful.
"Went there on saturday 230pm, waited for like 40min to receive. Very crowded, tables packed so not very cleanly maintained.
Quality and quantity was good tho. You get rice, soup, chicken and veggie.
Veggie was a bit odd, chilli and pineapple?
It was like 3 chicken orchestra + 1 electric guitar."
Nice chicken rice stall but pricey although comes with free soup and ah char (Pickles)
"When my office was in one of the units at Katong Shopping Center, I used to visit this store regularly till I put on a few kgs ...Yes! Chicken rice is high in Carbo :(

Love their rice, not so oily.  Their chicken meat is quite tasteless but their sauce added taste to it so is nice.  Whether you dine in or tabao, you will get a plate/pack of Ajar which quite big in portion and you can ask for more if you eat at the food court.  Another dine in benefit is you get free flow of their chicken soup and some time Zhu Du Tang 

The older staff (both male & female) whom I think are the bosses, they can be quite bad temper when there are crowd bcos some customers really quite ""one kind""... can take several rounds of soup or ajar and the chilli sauce as well, for just a plate of chicken rice....

The younger guy with good complexion i believe is the son, ever since he joined the team can see lots of initiatives eg, all the food delivery platform which some stalls in the same food court have not introduced.. and lately he even set up membership platform for customers to earn points when they bought chicken rice from them.

Updated on 5 Jan 2024
- back to Katong Shopping Centre and went to try their chicken rice but the price went up quite a bit.... But still good especially the soup :-)"
"Very garlicky and will be great for those who like that full on garlic experience.

Chicken and rice both executed on point and the chili was nice and not too vinegary. Dark Soy was very very good. If I go back to eat it again I will ask that the garlic/shallot oil and crumb be left off (personal preference)

Quite expensive to be honest and perhaps they could consider having cheaper prices for those who might not want the ""complimentary"" pineapple achar and soup.

Did not have to wait long at all, despite what I've read on other reviews, even though the coffee shop was full of diners mostly having Chicken rice.

Coffee shop itself is very rustic and old skool set in a rustic old skool shopping center...but it needs a proper clean imo."
Love the roasted chicken with loads of freebies like soup and achar
Best chicken rice in the area. The free achar and soup were superb too. Service might not be the best though.
"Probably one of my favorite, and maybe one of the best Hainanese chicken rice in Singapore.
For $7.60, you get a plate of fragrant chicken rice, a plate of tender, juicy, steamed or roasted chicken meat with sliced cucumber and sweet/savory soy sauce, a plate of ajar (pineapple, cucumber, onion salad), a bowl of hearty chicken vegetable soup. And not to forget the chilli sauce, black soy sauce and ginger sauce.
At $7.60, one may consider it a bit pricey as a typical plate of chicken rice (normally just rice+chicken+small bowl of soup) would cost $4-5.
But for me, it is an OK price to pay for a good plate of chicken rice, soup and salad. Definitely way way way way way better than the over rated Tian Tian at Maxwell."
Great chicken rice. Chilli is all that matters in chicken rice and this stall's chilli is good. This will also give complimentary nice achar. 
"Best Chicken Rice.. Portion, wow..."
"Delicious chicken rice and chicken dishes. It comes with a free chickem lotus soup for chicken set for 2. Added crystal chicken feet, which was very good.
Very crowded when i was there for lunch, not surprising though for its good food."
"Standards have fallen tremendously, rice is no longer fragrant, not to mention the sky high prices paid for sub standard chicken rice. This stall is riding on past glories, a pale shadow of what it used to be. There are many chicken rice stalls out there costing half the price per plate but tasting way better. If the owners don't do something about the quality of the food and reinstate things as they were previously, a demise is on the horizons pretty soon."
found a fly 
Big portion for 7 dollars. Very nice
" Overrated
 Overpriced
 Not nett pricing
 Wanted to order 2 individual portions ($6.70 each), but staff insisted we have 2-person portions ($12.80) and ended up paying 40cents more
 Rice charged separately, ridiculous
 Soup is not refillable
 Inaccurate signage: Soup of the day said peanut soup but was served cabbage soup

 Taste is ordinary
 Came with achar"
"One of my favourite places to get Chicken Rice growing up in SG. Sad to not be able to give it a 5 star as I recently felt like standards have been fluctuating.. Sometimes it's as good as it was years ago, sometimes it just misses the mark. I don't mind the increase in price as I understand the inflation costs, but am disappointed with the inconsistency especially when the price point of the chicken rice is on the premium side. Hopefully this will be looked into as it's a pity to see one of my fave places deteriorate.

P.S I eat here 1-2 times a week since I moved to Katong awhile ago and used to come here every Saturday as a kid with my mum to eat at KTMW."
"Delicious chicken rice, comes w big bowl of soup."
"The food is great, and would honestly recommend this place to anyone and everyone. The quality is consistent through the years despite having last eaten here a decade ago due to having moved overseas."
"The taste of chicken (""white"") was nice. Tender meat with the right amount of soya sauce.  Our kids like it.

Rice was average + but goes well with the chicken.

Chilli  was good.

We love the free ""chicken legs"" soup. Flavourful and yet full of ingredients.

It is very difficult to get a table!.... Be patient!"
"IT IS NOT BONELESS. Roasted Quarter chicken for 2 pax, had to add costly oyster sauce veg (way too salty) @ $6+ for few pieces of leafy vegetables more expensive than salad bowls. The roasted quarter chicken costs $16+ without much meat and mostly bones. Cheated to get quarter chicken instead of 2 individual plates of chicken drumstick rice. No refills for soup. Way too overpriced chicken rice considering the portion size. 2 pax costs $25. Flavour is way too salty to the extent it tastes quite artificial, probably due to low grade sauces and too much white sugar used. The food court is poorly ventilated, the trapped heat makes the place very suffocating. Waited 40mins on Sunday lunchtime. Definitely not value for money. Regret bringing my friend here."
"When utilising the platform for the first time, I inadvertently select the takeaway option rather than the delivery one. Fortunately, the team was so accommodating and kind that they helped me coordinate a last-minute delivery. They even sent me complimentary side dishes, including the soup and achar. The main course, chicken, is velvety and delectable."
"Chicken - good!
Soup (free!) - good!
Rice - normal
Char Siew - not good

Overall recommend to check out. Long queues, be advised."
Used to taste a lot better. Service is pretty slow too.  Only saving grace is that it comes w complimentary soup. Would direct real chicken rice lovers to the one at golden mile hawker centre. IYKYK.
"Famous for many a good reason! Chicken rice set is so complete with a bowl of tasteful chicken soup (generous cabbage included), big portion of chicken meat with lots of cucumber slices, and a plate of fresh achar with pineapple dices. Excellent value for money as the portion of rice, chicken meat and vegetables are all good portions. Probably the chicken rice meal accompanied by the most vegetables in Singapore. For veg and achar lovers, it's a bliss."
"Chicken was tender and tasty, vegetable and beansprouts sides also very good. However crispy pork dry and tired and the yellow rice for the chicken itself tasteless. Cooking in massive bulk now as very busy place, quite famous and becoming a victim of its own success."
"For those say this is the best chicken rice in singapore , you may not eat the best in singapore , I agree all negative review, this is the worst I ever eat , chicken too dry, rice too hard n dry, chilli no traditional taste, soup no chicken soup taste,  acha also not the best taste I ate b4, totally fail of singapore traditional chicken rice taste, price charge not worth to pay for it."
"1st time tried their regular steamed chicken rice, char siew and chicken feet skin.

Their Regular steamed rice is very unique as they used Thai rice. Their chicken with fried garlic which is very nice and tasty when you eat.

Their Chicken Feet Skin with Thai sauce is very tasty and nice and very unique too"
Huge portions! Also loved the soup that accompanied the chicken rice
"With a heavy heart, I have to provide my honest reviews. This is by far one of the best white chicken rice as it comes with free archar and good amount of pork ribs, peanuts and chicken feet. But every time I am done with the meal, I feel pretty thirsty every time.
Try to avoid the peak hours as waiting time is long and it's a challenge looking for a table"
Delicious and clean and satisfying
"Purposely went to try this stall again after Malaysia ban fresh chicken into singapore. Taste the difference. Chicken was dry and tough. Even the glass chicken feet is too chewy compare to before. Well perks is the soup and Azar. But if this stall is like this taste due to import ban, I can fantom others chicken rice store... hope Malaysian unban the export soon.

Nov 2023 : Fresh chicken made the difference! Has upgrade back this stall chicken rice. Tender juicy chicken with free acha n chicken bone soup. Glass chicken feet skin is naturally collagens n liver was cook well to the core! Food quality A+ quantity A+"
Pretty good food. Tough atmosphere as it gets very crowded with long line in a very small space. The working folk was quite nice.
Not very nice atmosphere but good food and achar was on point. Soup was a little too peppery especially with the chilli from the achar.
My all time favorite chicken rice fix. Comes with nice soup.

"The chicken rice is very unique because they provide achar (pickled vegetables). At $7 per portion, they included the achar and a big bowl of soup per portion. It's very generous!

The rice is mild but fragrant, not too oily which is good. The rice color is more yellow than the chicken rice that I'm used to. We chose the steamed chicken - juicy and tender. The sauce is also just right. I think the achar is a good compliment for their dish. I normally prefer more flavorful rice than this but i think they executed a good balance here. Also the free soup is really good and filling too. I think it's a steal 

Ordering system is very orderly and streamlined. No card payment unless NETS."
"I have to agree with some of the negative reviews. The chicken sauce was too sweet, the chilli is too sweet, cabbage soup was okay, black sticky sauce was a tad too sweet & salty, the pickled vegetable or achar is the highlight where the pineapple is sweet, more like a fruit vegetable salad. The chicken liver was too chunky & could be better. It is also too pricey hence at best a 3  Note: strictly cash only. No credit cards or PayNow.

The ambience is a 4/10. Chairs & tables are dated and not cleaned.

Maybe for other positive reviewers they find it good enough. But sadly not a repeat."
"Grew up in the 90's eating this chicken rice. There's been tons of debate about the best chicken rice in SG, the truth is every recipe is slightly different. This chicken rice is the best in my book."
One of the best chicken rice in the East ! However do take note on the waiting time. Took 40mins on weekend lunch hours
Its a complete meal
"Probably one of, if not, the best chicken rice I've had for the past 35yrs.

Firstly, the achar is not sour but sweet! I'm not a fan of pineapples but this one is really nice n sweet.

Our meal came with a huge bowl of soup with vegetables. It was peppery and the cabbage was super soft. Can even find scraps of chicken in there.

The rice was yellowish and not too overly flavoured. It was great.

The roasted chicken breast were soft, tasty n nice~ the sauce was also great.

Overall, it's really awesome "
Delicious chicken rice -- some of the best I've ever had. Admirably efficient ordering and serving logistics. Great value for money.
"Used to rave about this place when I was younger. Now standards have dropped so much.
1. Pay $7.50 for Chicken rice takeaway. No soup no achar, for that price other competitors offer better.
2. When you ask for achar, they frown and give you a small packet. (Used to be self service, most likely times are hard due to rising costs)
3. Ask for soup, don't wanna give. Use to at least give cabbage soup or soup of the day. Give already like it's goodwill?

Why am I paying $7.50 for chicken rice when nearby competitors are more affordable?
The chicken rice honestly is so-so without the soup and achar I would at most pay $5.50 for.

Really like katong shopping center; it's time the stall fades away too."
"I have been going there since 2016 when I was living in the east. It's been awhile since I been there, it's also due to covid and all. The food is still taste the same, it's delicious. They are generous with the soup portion. Just avoid lunch and dinner time as it can be really crowded."
Best in Singapore 
best chicken rice in singapore!!
"Ordered 3 boxes of chicken and 2 boxes of chicken drumstick and ended with boxes of bones bits and chicken leftover bits, rice has no fragrance

Even if the taste is bad , which it is, the worst thing is being cheated, as I did not get what I ordered

If u pack n go, please check before taking delivery

Very very disappointed!! It is not about how expensive it is, it is really the store has no honesty"
"Ordered 4x steamed chicken thighs and 2x steamed chicken drumsticks for takeaway.  When we opened all 6 packages, we found only mid section chicken parts WITH bones.  Really felt cheated badly.  If any of you buy takeaway DO check.  The botak boss no longer working there.  Quality of chicken is so darn ordinary, not worth the price.  Any other less popular chicken rice tastes so much better.  Darn disappointing at being cheated and the poor quality of the chicken.  The rice also taste bland and quality of the rice grains is clearly of a lower grade."
the place is inside katong shopping complex.. inside food court.. the waiting time is long.. they give side dish with pineapple and pickle.. the pineapple tasted very nice.. also they add enough cucumber.. chicken was ok.. we tried the roasted chicken.. had many better roasted chickens in singapore..
"Whenever I have a hankering for chicken rice, KMW is my first choice.
A well-kept secret in its location, this spot doesn't disappoint. The chicken is succulent and full of taste, and the rice is fragrant and cooked just right.
The standout feature here is their Achar; its sour-tangy notes awaken your taste buds and make for an invigorating start to the meal."
"Had the roasted chicken breast set at $7.60, a little steep considering the location. However, it was as good as I remembered it. Chicken meat was juicy and the sauce and fried garlic provided a unique flavour profile.

Will recommend dining in over takeaway as soup and achar is provided for dine in and in my opinion is what makes the price justifiable.

Be sure to come early, if not be prepared to wait. I was there at 10:50+am and had seen some patrons eating already although the stated opening time was 11am. Placed my order and got it before the crowds started to come at 11+am. Other food options of YTF and Japanese donburis located within the same premises may be for you if you don't wish to have a long waiting time. They look not bad, will try those next time."
"Was going for Da Dong Prawn Noodle but they were closed on Tuesday. So popped over to Katong Shopping Centre to try this chicken rice that's quite famous.

Not bad not bad. They give free achar and boiled soup. And half a chicken that's humongous at $24 bucks. Quite legit given price inflation has been crazy.

It's a competent chicken rice. But I'm still a boon tong kee boi at heart. :p"
V good chicken rice with achar n a big bowl of soup..
Food was average
"I never expect to wait 45mins for chicken rice!  There are at least 4 person managing the stall and yet, the wait is terrible.   Expensive - $18 for a 2 person meal and with the 45mins wait, definitely not worth the visit!"
"Bought deep fried wing rice $8.50. Expensive. Fragrance chicken rice but not the deep fried chicken- a bit tough n dry meat, not moist."
Is a MUST TRY CHICKEN  RICE in Singapore. Check-in monthly
"Portion for the food is good. Would prefer if the sauce for the chicken is less salty. Love the achar, vegetables and the soup! Chilli is good too."
Price is no longer worth the quality
"Chicken rice is delicious with fried garlic bits and soya sauce. Veg was well cooked with slices of imitation abalone. For dine in, soup and ah zhai(preserved veg/pineapple) are free. Avoid peak timing i.e weekend lunch as you may need to wait an hour for your food. Limited table as well.
Food are slightly salty. Not sure if there's msg but felt quite thirsty after consuming the food.
Abt $7 for one pax chicken rice."
Business is brisk. This is one of the most expensive coffeeshop chicken rice stall in Singapore. Nothing exceptional about the chicken or the rice. The good thing is that they provide you with a side dish of pickles.
"Cash only stall.
Chicken tender, juicy and moist. Love the sauce they drizzled over the chicken. Half a chicken order comes with soup and a plate of pickled vegetables. $21ish for half a chick.
Located at the basement of shopping mall, in an air conditioned food court."
"Came here on a Friday morning when they just opened at 1045. Ordering is clear, they have a number system to call for your number.

Located in the kopitiam at the basement of Katong shopping centre, the place reminds me of those old kopitiam my father use to bring me to.

Ordered a single serving of the steamed chicken with less rice (small, $7.60$), and it came with achar and clear soup. The soup had cabbages inside but didn't taste like much. The steam chicken was more dry than tender (maybe cos they gave me the breast). The chicken rice was flavorful but nothing to shout about. The achar was refreshing and provided a much needed zing to the dish.

Though it was priced above average, they did give more chicken.

Overall would only recommend if you're in the area and there's no queue."
"V good chicken rice, only problem is that it is 1 hour waiting time for a Sunday 12noon lunch. Chicken rice is fragrant, actually everything is fragrant and delicious! Only thing this is pretty average are the tofu and char Siew which I would avoid in future.

But do do do take the whole chicken and ask for 1/2 roasted 1/2 white. So gooood!"
Waited 1 hour plus for 4 plates of chicken rice
"Recommended by friends and tried it recently. The chicken meat (white Bai Zhan Ji), chicken liver, chicken feet skin, garlic chilli, free chicken soup and Achar (Malaysian salad) taste good. The chicken rice looks yellow and nice but didn't taste as expected. Otherwise, it will be a perfect combination 
Can skip the roasted pork (Shao Rou) though "
"Famous boneless chicken (roasted or white/streamed) rice set very yummy. Average price is $7.50-7.90/set comes with generous portions of meat, cabbage soup, achar, cucumber, sesame oil. Oops forgot to take photos  See attached receipt for various meat types pricing. Queue starts as early as 11am. Limited numbers of tables within the mini-food court; kind of eat, drink and go as patrons will be waiting for seats."
This whole place is rundown as if closing down soon. I did not buy anything and left.
One of my favourite places to eat when I'm in Singapore! Amazing chicken rice with free soup and pickled vegetables. I would definitely recommend a visit if you're in town!
"I think the food standard dropped. came here many times before but this is probably 3 years ago. Price wise is favorable and it's good that they maintained giving out soup and acah. I cMs on National Day, the food court is overwhelmed with its customers, my Q no. Was 981 when it was serving 939! . We waited for about 30 mins, luckily we found a table to sit while other patrons were standing and waiting."
"$7.60 + GST for a place of chicken rice in a Coffeeshop setting, is it expensive?
Yes and No.

Yes, because it's a normal place of chicken rice that tastes like most chicken rice at other other hawker centers or coffee shops. The rice really wasn't as fragrant as it should be.

No, because they offer nice soup to pair with the rice as well as some achar (however I dun eat it), but I guess soup and achar has already been taken into consideration when pricing the chicken rice. Portion of meat given was also bigger than most. So in these sense it satisfy the price tag.

Would I be back? No, I will not be back because I can get a plate of chicken rice of similar taste or better elsewhere for a much cheaper price. My all-time favorite will still be Wee Nam Kee at Novena. (But Wee Nam Kee is a restaurant setting so do expect to pay more)"
Excellent place for chicken rice. Uniquely Singaporean taste. The boneless glass chicken feed was my favourite dish.
The best Chicken Rice in Singapore
Went there at 3pm on a Sunday. Placed my dabao order. Almost no queue. Waited 50 min for the food to be ready. The aunty there could have had the courtesy to warn me about the long wait before I paid.
"Food is good, service is commendable. Overall god experience."
"The ordering system has been very streamlined the past couple of years which has led to a relatively fast-moving line and quick service of food. The steamed chicken rice here will always be our favourite, and we love the complimentary daily soup and archar (Malaysian pickled vegetables). Would probably consider it one of the best chicken rice options in Singapore."
Generous portion but the rice is a little bit too dry and hard. Roasted and steamed Chicken both well cooked. Very packed during lunch hour.
Very crowded due to 95% of the table are waiting for the chicken rice meal. Waited almost one hour. However the wait is worth it. Fragrant rice. Tasty chicken. Yummy soup
"Have been frequently patronising this chicken rice stall because I love it! The generous serving of tender, juicy roasted chicken with yummy skin, doused with sesame soy sauce sauce, fried shallots and garlic makes me drool! Dab it into the chilli sauce, black sauce and ginger for the additional punch! The rice is fragrant and not too oily. Each order comes with a large serving of soup filled to the brim with ingredients - usually carrot/radish soup, peanut soup, cabbage soup, lotus root soup or szechuan veg soup. Not forgetting the homemade achar containing cucumber slices, pineapple chunks and carrot slices. Half a chicken with 2 plates of rice with 2 additional eggs cost $25.

They serve char siew and roasted pork belly too, though we have not tried them before. It's crowded during peak hours, so be prepared to queue, though the service is efficient and the queue moves fast. Sometimes you have to wait for a table as well, but it's still worth the wait and the calories!"
"This is a very good place  , with good seats and good food. Came with family and ordered for 3 portion. More than enough and chicken was more tasty and soft compared to outside chicken rice. Over rall , the price matches its taste and it is quite worth it."
"Chicken rice used to be boneless but apparently not anymore. We were served two portions, mainly bones and wings but were charged full 7SGD per dish.
Upon confronting the cashier I was told that one has to explicitly ask for ""breast"", which seems to be the same price. I am confused, but at least was refunded 50% after asking for it.
Also, please be careful, as little sharp bones are at times between the meat, I guess because they just cut through with a bone chopper knife."
"2nd time. Great value, but that's about it"
"White chicken is well garnished with lots of crispy fried garlic. Meat is soft and tender and comes with complementary achar and a bowl of double boiled lotus root peanut soup which is very tasty. The deboned chicken feet dish is good too. Only down side is the atmosphere. Although airconditioned, environment is not so clean, place is small and hard to find a table during peak hours. Avoid dinning there if you are rushing for time."
"Cashier was unfriendly when taking orders .
Rice was too oily .Chicken meat was so so..
At least have tried once and that's enough"
Popular because of review and the free salad.
"Hao Chi, Fei Chang Xi Huan Mian Fei De Tang, You Hao Da Wan. Shuang"
"A local, perennial favourite for a sumptuous meal of chicken rice in the East.

Chicken is tender and served with a seductively moreish soy-sesame sauce, which is topped by fresh spring onions and fried garlic. Unique to this stall is the complimentary soup (which there is more than one variety, and which comes with ingredients) and the acar which is served on a separate plate. Rice is not the most flavourful, but goes amazing with the soy-sesame sauce, along with the mildly spicy chilli and minced ginger sauces.

Additional ingredients (chicken leg, braised tofu): they are not must-haves, but I find myself getting them every time I visit. Springy, cold chicken feet with steaming hot tofu - it is a strange juxtaposition, but one which I still love.

4.4 / 5"
"Hard to find tables , waited some time for food to arrive as so many people buying it. Gave a huge bowl of soup , vege. Value for portion wise. But I think it's not the best chicken rice in sg"
Best to go during off peak hours. This eatery is small. Finding a table would be difficult on weekends.
Unparalleled. Have been coming here since I was a kid. Comes with achar and two soups; the neighbouring rojak + Dona Manis cake shop are GOATs too
Been here since forever. They recently raised the price to $7.. but honestly it still tastes amazing! Only complaint is the price!
"Order 3 person portion with extra 2 braised eggs. Ask the auntie whether there's peanut soup. She told me need to order extra meat (Char Siew or Roasted Pork) to get the peanut soup.

Saw the uncle preparing the food put a bowl of peanut soup on my tray, but the auntie ask him to take it away.

Lousy service with hard-sell."
"Best chicken rice ever !
Served with soup (lots of ingredients) and archar !
The downside is the seating because it is always packed and not easy to get a table. The floor wasn't really clean too. I suggest you bring your own wet wipes to clean the table before having your meal."
"I were there at 11.01am, the stall opens at 11am. The queue were already long! They have very good system, hence the waiting time is not long. Within 5 mins I received my food. 2 pax they gave the lotus root soup which is very flavourful. The complimentary Achar is very refreshing too. I prefer the steamed chicken than the roasted one as its more juicy and tender. The egg is average. The roast pork is average."
"Nice chicken rice, soup and the chilli. Slightly pricey though."
"There are eateries, restaurants that milk for every services (with no service) and product offered (plain water) from every walking-in customers. Then there is this guy, providing not just top notch chicken rice, but a hearty meal with warm soup and achars for all the hardworking people after an honest day's work. A sincerity which is a rarity in today's FnB business. Deserved a 5 star rating."
Pricey yet many daft return cust.
"Known as the best chicken rice in town! The set meal comes with chicken rice, of cos, their homemade acar and a bowl of soup! Actually the bowl of soup is quite nice! My friends said the acar is delicious too. Crunchy.

Didn't manage to take photos before eating!

They also recently opened a new outlet at east village, by the same owner!"

"I'm thrilled to be back at Katong Mei Wei Boneless Chicken Rice! This time, I have the pleasure of bringing my parents along for the first time in years. Ahhhhh, the memories of this mall! I used to come here all the time for my bowling sessions.

This place serves one of Singapore's BEST CHICKEN RICE, and I can't help but rave about it. The poached chicken is tender and flavourful, perfectly complemented by the fragrant rice. And let's not forget the daily special soup they generously include for free! It's like a warm hug for your taste buds. Oh, and the chicken spare parts like gizzard and boneless chicken feet? SO SHIOK ! ! ! !

But wait, there's more! The folks at Katong Mei Wei are incredibly generous. They serve a great cucumber alongside the dish, adding a refreshing crunch. I remember hearing about their free-flow achar, but I've never had the chance to try it. Honestly, I've never needed any extras because their regular portion is so generous. I always feel happily stuffed after indulging in their scrumptious chicken rice. It's a delightful problem to have!

Returning with my parents and enjoying this mouthwatering meal is an absolute treat.

*Do note that this is a small coffee shop and limited seats."
"Is this the same Chicken Rice as back when you were young? No the free flow of achar and soup is gone for good and the price is about twice as back then.

However for $7 you get a very decent, very juicy portion of chicken (I got the breast and it was very moist!), rice, soup and achar together with their homemade ginger garlic and chili sauces. It is a substantial meal and the chicken was outstanding. The cashier aunty is her usual ""jolly"" self but didn't bother me much. I did come during offpeak hours so I was served fast. Definitely recommend takeaway if you don't want to eat there. I definitely recommend for the old school Singapore experience and quality chicken rice!"
"Update Jun 2023: Chicken rice is still delicious but it's not served boneless anymore. Also, Ah Char is only given upon request. Cash only. It's now $7 but still very worth it given the portion of the chicken has also increased, the plates and tray look new. Guess they did a visual update recently, stall also looks a bit more spruced up too.

Old review: Not the most fragrant chicken rice I've eaten but it's still decent, very value for money and the soup is awesome - its the kind of soup that your Chinese grandmother/parents will cook and they throw in chicken bones, cabbage, lotus roots, peanuts etc

For only SGD 5.50, you get a plate of chicken rice, hearty bowl of home-cooked soup goodness and pickled vegetables (it's not really achar guys)"
"not 1st time trying but definitely will be the last. standard drop until very bad, chicken drumsticks can taste as dry as chicken breast. floor is so sticky that my sandals got stuck a couple of times while queueing  tray returning area really stinks.
most of all, the service is really bad, esp the cashier auntie. she accused another customer for taking extra set of (not sure if is cutlery or sauce) & removed everything from his bag. she didn't find any extra stuff & just walked away without apologising. leaving that customer repacking back his stuff & voicing his unhappiness at her."
"I think those who grew up eating this stall would agree that in recent times, their chicken just doesn't taste the same. The breast meat was tough and not worth the premium price. No more free flow soup - this used to be the best part of the experience. To add on to that, the cabbage soup tasted different (the cabbage in the soup is not as soft and soup is not as peppery). The achar looks pre packed as the size is different and doesn't taste as sour. I used to say this is hands down the best chicken rice in SG  but sorry this is not the katong boneless chicken rice I used to know."
"Best chicken rice I had in Singapore.
Their soup is also very flavorful compared to other chicken rice stall"
"Food not bad, soup very nice"
"Good enough local favorite but it's not boneless but that's ok. The unique offering is their soup and acar and their pricing is reasonable and certainly beat those ""famous chef's recommendation"" eg Maxwell TienTien chicken rice hands down and anytime! Worth the Q and they have developed a good system for takeouts "
The chicken rice is good but it's abit difficult to find seating especially for groups with more than 4 pax.
"The chicken is decent and tender. We ordered a quarter chicken for 2 of us, and portion was quite big. The price of a quarter chicken is around 75% of the price for half a chicken. The place have very crowded on weekends and you probably need to wait to find a seat and might be a problem if one have to eat alone, as you need to queue to make your order, and then wait for your number.

Overall, we read the mall is going to enbloc, so we just went to eat before it close for good, other than that, there are many decent chicken rice stalls around without having to wait and queue so long, not really worth the effort."
"Biggest change since my last visit few months ago.

No more digital payments. Went backwards from digital to cash only. No more credit card rebates for customers, more savings for the vendors.

Shrinkflation - top ups for soups are no longer available. Which is a shame because the soup is a big reason I pay a premium to eat here. To me that was one of their strongest selling point which got a lot weaker.

Upsized chicken rice $9 price which was the same as late last year. Fair to say the price of soup is and Achar are included though I don't eat achar and declined taking it to avoid wastage.

So personally, this place dropped from a solid 4.5 stars to 1.5 stars for me as I get less value than in the past. I will still patronise them as I do enjoy the food but will visit less often for the above reasons. Hope this review was helpful to others who value the two points I brought up.

Auntie cashier (not very polite as most reviews have commented) said no more soup tops because they were busy. Could have given me a bigger bowl from the start? But we all know the real reason is stinginess."
"Been coming here for years, and it's still one of my favourite chicken rice of all time!"
"Food was good, and I was expecting boneless chicken, however it was with bones. Not sure if I ordered a wrong meal."
"Taste 3/5
Portion to price 5/5
Comes with soup and archar

Return review: juicy chicken, appetizing achar, soup too peppery. Rice has room for improvement."
Food and service is 
Succulent steamed chicken... homely hot soup and free achar to boost! Staff extremely friendly! Homing pigeons we shall be..
Love the chicken rice here. It's not just the chicken but their complimentary achar is out of this world too. Lots of soup for you if you're still hungry. The first time I was here was approximately 10 years ago and they've grown so popular since. We waited close to an hour around lunch time on a Saturday  worth the wait though.
Delicious with generous portion
Love their chicken rice with 2 different tasty soups and salad given foc with the soft and tender chicken. A pity about the rice though which can be more fragrant.
Had dinner with bunch of old friends on 7 May 2023. We were lucky to have amongst the last 3 customers to have our order. Food is well presented and delicious. Reasonably priced too. Highly recommend.
Very bad attitude and inpatient owner. The taste of the chicken rice is quite bad as well. Tastes like dead meat
"Always heard raving reviews and it did not disappoint! Portions are so generous. Love the complimentary achar and lotus/ peanut soup (super flavourful). While the steamed chicken is so meaty, fresh and packed with flavour, their rice leaves more to be desired hence -1 star. Have had more fragrant rice elsewhere but the chicken makes it all worth it!"
"Best chicken rice in SG , but sometime need to q for more than 25min, worth it "
"The chicken dishes, fragrance rice n side broth were good, but the gravy on the chicken meat was a bit on the salty side. We placed 2 orders of mixed dishes, i.e. roasted n white steamed BUT WAS GIVEN ONLY A PLATE OF MIXED ACHAR TO SHARE WITH"
"Visited the East Village outlet and i must say they are very generous with their food portion. Chicken is tender and i recommend people to try the chicken feet. They also serve a variety of drinks, even though a little expensive but quality is good ! Will recommend everyone to head down to the teacafe and give it a try !"
Missed e soup n came back. No more refill of e soup!! OMG. Soup today is missing its oomph... peppery taste. N its $7 per plate. Hmmm... at this price point without extra soup?!?! 
Superb value and the free soup really completes the meal. Fragrant peanut soup with chicken legs inside all for free
Pricey but nice. Steamed chicken nicer. Roast version dry like rubber if not for the sauce.
Definitely not worth buying. Owner got attitude problem.
"The worst chasiu I ever tried in Singapore. Bland taste and very dry. Nothing special about the roasted pork either. Skin was not crispy and it was cold overall

Prepare to wait for long queue and to look for table. The place was super packed on Sat lunch time.

Chicken rice was quite good, tender chicken, tasty sauce, nice soup. Portion is quite generous too.

They also have free acar with pineapple that other shops usually don't have. I was wishing it to be sour sweet and fresh. But it's just so-so."
"We came on a Tuesday afternoon 1pm.
Surprisingly busy. We had to wait 12 pax in front of us before we got our food. That took around 10-15 mins of waiting.

The only lovely part here is the free acah &  soup!
Their chicken is mediocre.
Big plus is the aircon as well.
Hence 3 stars."
"Rice is a little less fragrant than before, less yellowish. Still packs sufficient flavour. Steamed chicken breast is tender. Comes with peppery soup, and home made achar. Currently costs $7 for a single person set, and the portion is generous. Stall accepts cash only currently and churns out receipt with queue number. Chilli is not too spicy."
Always good
Haven't been to Katong Shopping Centre for sometime now. Tasted the chicken rice set but nothing much to shout about other than the generous portion of acar n the peppery cabbage chicken soup.
Absolutely The Best Chicken Rice in Singapore!!!
Food taste normal and staff are not very friendly and service 
Lunch time on Sunday.  The queue was long but the service was quick.  Overall nice. Will revisit.
Chicken rice @ $7 
Value for money. Taste great
"The chicken breast is soft and tender absolutely , $9.20 though and had to add $2 for char siew to get the lotus soup!
Char siew is not bad, achar is on point with huge chunks of pineapple, carrot and pickles.
Lotus soup must drink, very flavorful, no msg!
Be prepared to wait for sitting place and food.
The ipoh food was nice too, ordered the black noodles, sauce was thick and rich.
10/10 "
"This is the best chicken rice in Singapore (in my opinion), because the salty-sweet flavor of the sauce is a perfect complement to their delicious chicken meat and fragrant rice.

No where else would you find a chicken rice that gives you a full plate of achar and a big hearty bowl of traditional soup that's full of all the ingredients that you'd normally have to pay extra for.

Thank you, KYMW, for maintaining the same tastiness and awesomeness for the past 30+ years 

The best way to savor this gem (again, in my opinion ) is so drizzle lots of sauce with your rice like in my photo bdfore taking a bite - so good!"
"Popular chicken rice stall in Katong Shopping Centre. People staying around there should know this place well. I'm pondering between 4 or 5 stars for this. While the food is good, price is pretty steep too. 2 pax cost $15.80. But to be fair, the portion is big. Chicken meat is tender, fragrant, and comes in big portion. There is home made pickled veg/pineapple/onion too. Comes with veg soup also, big bowl somemore. Hence I settled for 5 stars. I do wish that the stall can consider no frills chicken rice at lower price (ie without soup and pickled veg). All in, it was a good experience. (I should add that ordering and serving was a breeze. System is run very well)."
"Ji Rou You Liang Zhong Ke Yi Xuan Ze
Cai Tang Fei Chang Hao He,Shu Cai Liang Hen Duo
You Ti Gong Dian Jia Zi Zhi Yan Zhi Shu Guo Xiao Cai"
Food taste normal. Nothing great to shout about
"Fragrance rice... big portion, with soup yummy.. must try"
Chicken meat was sliced until like slice fish and the rest are chicken bones with skin. Not worth the trip there
Chicken rice is nice but workers there not so nice..
"Well done! Chicken was tender and soy sauce paired very well with rice 

Free vege and soup. Soup was exceptionally well cooked.. which I'm happy that it does not come with a separate price tag "
"Hidden coffee shop with most visitors having chicken rice besides yong tau foo and zi char stall. steam chicken available however it's cold, not warm. 1 pax meal consist of achar, soup, chicken and rice for $7. Overall was ok meal."
"Chicken rice was good.
2 packs chicken rice and 1 pack of chicken feet costs me $20. Don't know if considered abit pricey. But taste was good for sure"
"I feel so bad to say this for someone who loves this stall's food. that it is no more as good as before, chicken rice is not fragrant, chicken tough, there used to be separate ginger sauce, the chili sauce now is so lousy, there used to be flavourful lotus root soup given free but now there's only plain soup which was like drinking water overall so expensive, the archar too was very nice  before and we could take as much as we wanted. That's how the business grew so well that the neighbouring stalls just watched.
I can understand that things are now expensive but for Singaporeans, if food is something that leaves a good memory and experience. Until the same standard as his father is restored, I will then patronise them."
"This place stood out for its more than generous portions, which really pleasantly surprised me. We ordered a 2-person portion (chicken breast), which set us back by ~$11/pax, and were super full after all was said and done!

The chicken was relatively tender and tasty, and the (big bowl of) lotus soup was very hearty as well. We loved the achar too because one simply cannot go wrong with sweetened pineapple cubes. The only thing that was a miss was the roasted pork, which was very meh - I prefer the kinds with crispy skin, and this wasn't it. Chilli was also quite a hit! Would return if I was within the area and craving for chicken rice :)"
Very yummy and chicken juicy  
Bot half a chicken with 6 pkts of chicken rice for my daughter's family. Also bot 4 boxes of salad . Yummy. My daughter like their chicken rice very much
"The business for this place is good, advice to come off peak hours. Waiting time for food and finding a seat can be ridiculous.

For a spread of single portion @$7. My expectations maybe skewed towards the high end as there hype about this place is unreal.

Tasting the rice, it's like the one similar to the other that I think of in Bishan. Chicken was disappointingly dry for this portion (some parts tasted like breasts). I suspect to cover it up, it was drowned with this sauce that the cucumbers were soaked in. Soup was peppery.

The main star for me is the achar. Slightly sweet/ sour."
Food was good but wish it wasn't cold.
"Too noisy sometimes and quite narrow space. V tasty chicken rice but  unhappy with too many bony parts, delicious salad but portion has been reduced."
"The chicken rice here isn't like the usual small plates we get from other hawkers. Here, they serve it in huge portions and each order comes with a generous serving of homemade pickled & chopped vegetables (cucumber, carrots and onions). The accompaniment soups here are top-notch too, with specials like Lotus Root Soup or Cabbage Chicken Soup (given at random). One of the more unique chicken rice stalls I've come across in my 10+ years staying in Singapore! Come early because the queues will have you waiting during peak hours."
"One of the best chicken rice in Singapore.

The main reason for me to say that because the rice is not oily.

And the archar is consider unlimited, the stall mention can request if not enough.

Order roasted chicken drumstick cost: SGD 7.5."
One of the most terrible tasting chicken rice i have eaten ( katong ). Yellowish chicken rice what a joke! So i would never try out this place at east village
Food was OK. Chicken was quite hard and achar was not really freeflow. Ordered 3 chicken rice with one takeaway and was stopped when taking the 3rd plate of achar.
Standard drop a lot!
"They were famous & popular for their free flow of pickle cucumbers/pineapple/onions & chicken base vegetable soup. Yes, used to be self service & free flow.
Now a single person portion is $5.90 as per the photo. Chicken meat is actually so so only like any other chicken rice stall. Soup is very peppery. Love the pickled veg & pineapple though. Forgot to add kidney & liver. Lol "
"Not sure why people are still saying this is the best chicken rice in Singapore. 10 years ago maybe, but now the chicken is tough and meat pretty much tasteless. The free soup and ahchar is a plus but you're pretty much paying for a premium. Ming kee at bishan beats it hands down and any one of the chicken rice stalls at Margaret Drive taste much better. And most importantly they accept cashless payments."
"I've been here many times, they are very generous on the soup and the ar zha. It's one of the best chicken rice along this katong.
I always prefer the steam and some of my staff will like the roasted. You can choose to add on the parts that you like too.

Keep up that good work. 
Appreciate that you are around and serve us the awesome food.

When I eat chicken rice, I would love to pair them with salted fish with beansprouts, but once in a while, when I feel like having green, then I'll go for the vegetables with the oyster sauce.

Boneless chicken feet were continent as I was very lazy, and that solved my problem 

The embience gave you that old school feels, they bring back childhood memories at time, not sure if anyone feels like me?"
Our Malaysian friend introduce here. Nice Malaysian style food place. Must order squid.
"Tender chicken paired with fragrant steamed rice. Serving was huge for half a chicken, along with complimentary soup and achar (both free flow). Very worth it for those with huge appetite."
Best place to have good chicken rice. Expected to have long queue and long wait.
"The best chicken rice in Singapore hands down. Wait time was ridiculous at 45 minutes but the chicken rice was generous and delicious, tender and succulent chicken, amazing soups"
A cash only business of this size in 2023 doesn't make sense
Food's good but long waiting time. Expect to wait up to 45 mins during peak hours.
First time eat chicken rice need wait 45 minutes abit unbelievable should have stopped taking orders when they know they can't manage not recommended
"One of the best if not the best Chicken rice stalls hands down beats alot of other ""famous"" shops"
"Affordable and delicious one best chicken rice to have in sg. The steamed chicken is tender & juicy- even the chicken breast is moist. The sauce they used is flavorful not overpowering and made it chicken very appetitsing. Rare to find chicken rice paired with peranakan achar. The achar provides different textures, vegetables and enhances the balance of flavours. Get there early before lunch/ dinner rush hour to secure a seat"
"Stay nearby, been having this chicken rice since 1990 , totally agreed the standard had drop.  Order 1/2 chicken takeaway, only give me breast meat , no wings no drumsticks."
"This place is typically mobbed. Why? I don't know. It's tasteless cold boiled chicken with white rice. I don't know why singaporeans go crazy for this, but they do. I found it to be absolutely mediocre, and additional, having to eat the meal sitting on a stool as is so common in Singapore. Whatever!"
Very yummy chicken rice with free achar.
Chicken rice one of the best amongst the food court providers. Have been a patron for over 20+ years.
"The white chicken and rice are the star of this stall. Char siau are on the sweet side, and you won't find overly black burn pieces some crave for. The roast pork is OK lacking the cripsy skin surface a lot will die for. I do enjoy chicken glizzards too, and do try if you dare. The affordable cost, free ahcar and soup, especially the peanut lotus chicken soup, is a no brainer why I think this is my favourite stall on the island , JB and some say batam. Must try!"
"Nice rice, soup and archar. Will visit again. Cashier was patient with orders. Their beancurd also tasty. Chilli n ginger also very good."
"Best chicken rice in SG. Fight me 
I always eat the steamed chicken. If you order side dishes, they'll give lotus root pork ribs soup for free. The cabbage soup is peppery and light, I love this too.
Chicken rice is fragrant and not overly oily.
The sauce is the bomb.
I didn't like it when I had takeaway tho, the rice became soggy because of the sauce. Hope that they will improve the takeaway packaging for extra cost."
"Yummy hawker chicken rice
Had take away

Recommend for all"
"Food quality dropped. I guess folks getting complacent. I went during offpeak afternoon. Claimed boneless, though no queue and all staff pretty free, chit-chatting. I asked for boneless several occasions and without fail, they didn't want to do it. Disappointing. Further down the mall, golden Cafe is a better bet for services, and more choice of food."
"I'm sorry to die-hard fans of this place, but the chicken rice is just not it. The chicken is mushy (not tender, but mushy). There were many small shards of bones in the chicken which made it so hard to eat.

The fried garlic and shredded carrots distract from the chicken and sauce. The soup is a nice twist from the usual plain chicken rice broth but I find myself thinking that it does not go well with the chicken rice. The rice is average. Chilli was average too.

Maybe I'm just a purist when it comes to chicken rice so I really didn't enjoy this sadly. I will recommend others to try Yishun 925, Tong Fong Fatt, or Kheng Hai Hui instead."
"Standard dropped tremendously, neither rice nor chicken can compare to its quality of years back.

No loss in skipping this chicken rice."
"Not the same as before. The rice lost the fragrant taste. The chicken somehow also tastes different. Seems as though the original owners sold the business? (I don't know).

Ordered salted fish beansprouts. Collected dish without salted fish and went to check to be told that they ran out of salted fish.

Erm... could have told me that wasn't any salted fish when I was ordering? What is salted fish beansprouts without salted fish?

All in all. The taste of the rice, sauce (for chicken) and even the soup taste different from before. I was really hungry but did not want to finish the rice.

To each of his own but I don't like this anymore."

One of the best chicken rice in Singapore in a hidden jem of a place. Portion is generous and free flow soup (lotus peanut & cabbage) and their archar is to die for.
Nice and tasty
"Just a regular chicken rice store. Somehow, the free soup has been included with the rice. So, you are paying premium if you don't want the soup."
"The higher acclaimed Katong chicken rice , taste average but above average pricing. $6.70 for plate of chicken rice. (However it does come with plate of acha and soup)

My advice? Skip it, nothing special or different from any other chicken rice on the island

If you look at its rating and think it's going to wow you, you are going to leave disappointed"
"Used to eat here .the whole standard  from taste ,price and customer service have drop ...wonder if there is a change of boss."
"Will not eat again no matter how good it taste when service is like we own them a million dollar. My experience below:
Had this last week w friend and so today asked my mom & Bro to go try. Were there at around 1040am. Went to order but staff don't give a Fxxx. Ask them what time start, don't even bother to tell you. Ask another staff and the reply shock us. 'Boss not here cannot start'. Don't know what they are thinking. Really bad attitude on the staffs. Eventually eat Yong Tau Foo instead, for our lunch."
Food so so only. Don't know why the hype. Services is bad though. They forgot that customers are the one who are supporting their business. Will not visit again.
"As usual. Business good, give attitude."
Great food!
"White chicken taste ok, not tender, sauce a little too sweet for my taste buds.
Chili is good.
The soup and achar is a nice add on.
Love the braised egg and Tau gua, served hot with nice sauce.
Overall, value for money."
Still my fav chicken rice in sg
"The chicken was tender but not outstanding, and the chilli was ok. The star of the show would be the soup and the achar."
One of the better chicken rice out there. Plenty of achar and peanut soup free! Excellent rice and chili. Chicken is decent
"Never disappointed. The taste exactly SAME as 2 year ago before we wearing mask  .

Side dish and the lotus chicken soup is the best ."
"Chicken rice is still as good, not as boneless as the name says.

Didn't ask us for soup type so we got the chicken soup which is a bit salty. Portions were big for 2 pax.

A bit hot in the food court and crowded as well so do come before or after lunch hours."
"A chicken rice stall in a aircon food court. If you come during lunch time, most likely no seats or table. You will need to wait. Chicken rice come with good soup and vegetable if you dine in. For take away, you may have to pay for the soup."
Chicken rice shop hidden in a basement of in Katong.
Side lotus root and peanuts is delish
"Delicious chicken
Delicious soup
Free flow Achar"
They have been around for a really long time. Generous food portion and the food taste great. Good price point. Please support them and be patient.
Long q but organised.  Many people eating. Found it to be expensive for $6.70 a pack although lots of meat ...
"I would say its value for money, but the service is horrendous. The person is always pulling a long face, and reluctant to answer any futher questions other than accepting payment from the menu that is clearly illustrated. Not an establishment that i will make an effort to revisit."
"Noodles and sauce was great tasting just like in K.L
Will certainly go back again with friends ."
Big crowded in the small makan place .but food wise was good .
"Always good~ not just the chicken rice itself, the soup, salad, and sides are simply perfect match. Not to mention all come at a affordable price considering the portion, free salad and soup. Definitely the best Chicken Rice in Singapore for me. It's much better than other overated tourist famous chicken rice in CBD. Prefer white over roasted."
The GO TO for Chicken Rice im Singapore!
Best chicken rice in sg
"I bought the roasted chicken set meal. Disappointing experience as I was expecting normal breast meat/thigh meat but the fella gave me 2 pieces of chicken wings and very little portion of meat. Obviously the stall helper was giving me the remaining parts. Standard has dropped quite a bit in terms of the meat quality, but the price has gone up nevertheless. You definitely can get better deal and chicken rice elsewhere."
Good stuff. Tabao a few packet
"Not reccomended for take out as you would  miss out on the achar and soup.

The chicken is otherwise dry and lacking in flavour."
Brought out of town guests here for their first Singapore Chicken rice experience. All left with a happy belly!
"Still one of my favourite chicken rice, the taste of the rice have improved. Rice last time was tasteless. The chicken was tender and the Shao Ji was great . It also come with a plate of A-car and also big bowl of soup. Lastly for those that like checker feet, can give that a try. But is more on the sweet taste. But to my liking...  Recommend to give it a try if you have chicken rice craving."
Was very crowded but the food was excellent.  I brought my guests from Australia to enjoy the chicken rice.
Best chicken rice in Singapore
"*update*

Visited again today and left feeling disappointed again - ordered thigh and it's boneful chicken rice (instead of boneless chicken rice).

The roasted chicken was really dry today sadly

*********

I think the chicken rice is really nice and I've been visiting this stall with group of friends.

I like it so much that I'll even eat here by myself sometimes.

However, I think the problem with dining here is the consistency - unless the whole chicken, you only get part of the chicken if you order an individual set.

There are times where the meat portion is relatively small (ie what am I even eating) and comprises mostly of bones

Probably won't order individual set again"
Great texture and flavours.
"Yummy and delicious chicken rice. They are really generous with the amount they give, esp with the free soup and achar. Highly Recommended!"
My single breast meat set comes with peanut lotus soup and achar. My eating habits love this Chicken rice here. But... The price have been going up up.
Early dinner. Satisfying.
"This place was recommended to me by a Singaporean, so I had to check it out.
Some people say it is the best chicken rice of the whole island. I don't know if this is true but it sure is the best one I had by far, and I had quite a few.
The chicken is perfectly cooked, with a very pleasant texture, with excellent seasoning. The rice is good too (not outstanding but good).
The sauce is fantastic. Spicy, flavourful, balanced.
The set features a (big) soup and a salad with cucumber, shallots, pineapple and tomatoes. Not entirely sure why but it's alright (I mean it's cut vegetables and fruits that's it).
All and all an excellent experience."
"Saw that it's highly rated in Google and decided to try it. There are two different sets of hawker centers on the same level on each end. We came around 6 pm and they already ran out of roasted chicken. The portions are very generous, there's also complementary peanut soup. The chicken is great but the sauce is a little sweet to my liking.
Food - 8
Service - 8
Vibe - 7
Price - $"
"Good value food. Great taste, and you don't have to worry about the bones in the chicken!"
Underated best kept secret of katong
Both their steamed and roasted chicken are delicious. The portion is also generous. Avoid lunch and dinner time to avoid long queues.
"Always my favourite place for chicken rice, stall already had a queue before it opens ! Love the free acar and soup, even if you are dinning alone. Good job folks"
"Best chicken rice to date, comes with a huge bowl of soup! Love the rice, so fragrant!"
Nice and good..
"Meat portion is little and price is high (single set $6.7, whole $38). There are other better chicken rice."
Amazing soup that came along a huge portion of the meat. Go for the portion version if u're a big eater to get the most value.
the cheapest now one packet $6.70. attitude of the old man is very bad.
One of the best chicken rice.
"Looking through the internet and found this chicken rice shop. First time here. Am surprised it is located inside quite a rundown shopping centre.
Self ordering but the cashier is either having a bad day, with no smile or happiness in his face. Whatever it is, it doesn't give a good first impression. Hopefully they take note of this and improve.
Ordered both poached chicken and roasted chicken thigh. Taste wise is ok but not exceptional compared to where I come from. But for the price they are selling, it's worth every cents and more. Free soup and acar too. Totally value for money in these trying times. No wonder they are the darling of locals living around Katong.
Their packaging is exceptional first class !!"
Nice chicken rice however price keep increasing . A little bit pricey for a plate of chicken rice
"So so only, the soup got additional charge, and now one plate of chicken rice is $6.7. Slightly expensive if the environment like hawker feel"
"Fast service, great variety, awesome food, especially the soup!!"
Chicken rice getting oilier and very stingy with soup. Im sure there are alot better options that are cheaper out there.
"Have been a loyal customer for a long time! Took away half a roasted chicken from here 3 weeks ago. While it was great that they gave complimentary soup and achar, the half chicken was almost completely either breast meat (tough, tasteless) or bones with little meat. It was definitely not half a chicken and I suspect the better parts (thigh) had been retained for other customers. Would not go back again"
Slightly expensive and average tasting bowl of chicken rice. Soup can taste that they have added lots of pepper.
Expect super long queue during lunch time
"Best Chicken Rice in Katong Singapore. Generous portions of chicken, complimentary refill of soup and salad, all for $5...
Updated 30 Aug 2022, prices are up.. small set $6.70, extra meat chix thigh set $9.60.. but still have all the vegs and bone soup you can eat !!"
"Tried the archa ... hmm not really season type..nothing specially..
Just fruit taste.. pineapple and cucumber taste."
Time to get rid of tray return policy? Tables here are just disgustingly dirty and how the h*** is anyone suppose to enjoy the food here???
"The soup is super salty,  and vege as well. The rice lacks the fragrant smell and chicken looks dry. Overall, over rated."
"First time trying as there was quite a number of good reviews.
It was a decent chicken rice but same as many other stalls. The rice was not as fragrant, chicken meat was a bit dry.
The free Archar was good, soup was ok."
"horrible experience taking away, I unknowingly waited for 1+ hour for a chicken rice. they didn't even bother thanking customers for waiting. what a joke business"
"Classic. Have been going to this place for years. They serve really good soup with your chicken rice (think cabbage soup, lotus root soup) and green achar too."
"Finally got to try this famous chicken rice around Katong. The set meal is pretty expensive but it comes with chicken rice, Acar(pickled vegetables) and a bowl of soup.

The rice is one of the highlight to this enjoyable meal. It's garlicky and fluffy! The chicken is also tender and juicy.

I'm not a fan of acar, but this acar is nice,tangy and spicy.

Overall this chicken rice store is worth the visit during the weekends."
"Taste of chicken is fresh, although is the ""white"" chicken the inner of the chicken near the bone not bloody - if anyone can relate to this will understand. Definitely will come again!
Not forgetting the FREE SIDE DISHES!"
The chicken still good & still generous w portion 
Ask to debone the chicken but never. Chicken is chop into big pieces.
"I haven't had such a good chicken rice in a while! It comes with soup, generous amount of cucumber and very tasty chicken in good quality soy sauce. Worth every calories."
Serving is generous and interesting mix of archar and vegetables apart from its core dish.
Very good Chicken rice. Portion was descent.
Standard has dropped dramatically. Definitely not worth the queue. Just go to your nearby chicken rice stall for better chicken rice.
"I often ate chicken rice here.I always packed it and ate it at home.I packed it today, but I was surprised to see the chicken.I chose the drumstick, but I could hardly find the chicken.I think it's too much to call it a meal for $7.20. family was so disappointed because it was so different from before.The packaging has changed.So we said it was because of the new packaging cost.It's delicious, but I don't think I'll eat it again at this price"
"Reached at 2pm, still got a steady stream of people, ordered 1/2 steamed chicken and 2 rice($21). It came with free soup and free achar. Satisfied! Will drop by when I'm there again..."
Good but not great. rice a tad bland. chilli is average. meat is nice but not great.
Good food and stream line
"The chicken meat is slightly hard , acai is not as good as before . The soup taste is too salty . There is no longer pack with meat and veg in soup"
"Pretty huge drop in standard over the course of a few months. Price of the chicken increased while portion size decreased significantly possibly due to inflation and Malaysian chicken export ban.
But I do not appreciate dry, tasteless rice, azar that tastes more like freshly cut fruits and vegetables, chicken with feathers still in tact, and a $5 lotus root peanut soup filled to the brim with only peanuts and thinly sliced lotus roots. It was as if there was a competition to see who could slice the finest and thinest slice of lotus root in the soup.

Also don't remember there being as much bones the previous few times i ate, not sure if owner is becoming lazier to debone my chicken for me but pretty disappointing to see THIS much bones considering the stall's name is ""bonless chicken rice"".

Disappointing visit, you can get better chicken rice at cheaper prices elsewhere. Over hyped unless they get back to their previous standards."
"Did a takeaway and was very disappointed with the parts given. It appears they strive to please those who dined in while the takeaways get the bones and skins. The pickle has mainly onion. What happened to cucumber, carrot? For $6.70, this is absurd. Not sure what the rave is about."
"We ordered mixed chicken for 2 pax, roasted pork, and the boss gave us lotus root soup and acar as complimentary dishes, very generous and liked it so much! We paid everything at $26, reasonable..."
"Ordered a mixture of both roast and white chicken, for 3. Expecting boneless as represented by sign at food court entry. They should remove it as it is misleading., although the KTMW signage at the stall itself did not mention anything boneless. So these were Big boned chicken and meat was cooked tough and needed quite some effort to tear off from the bones. Taste-wise was disappointing on all counts. Even the generous portions of cabbage and peanut soup and fairly good achar could not make up for substandard chicken rice like this. Even the chilli that could have helped, did not measure up. The chicken quantity looked promising but underneath were lots  and lots of cucumber to give the serving a ""substantial"" appearance. But never mind, we liked cucumbers and were hoping to have quality at the least.. Unfortunately, as we ate, we griped and counted at least 5 chicken rice locations that had easily very much tastier , succulent and superior chicken quality. Sad. Hope they realise and recognise how far short their recipe and approach is off and needs correction soonest to avoid the eventual business slide when more and more people try and learn that some well known reviewers' hype are just too kind and inaccurate, maybe through lack of experiences at other locations. We left looking for deserts to make up for what we thought would be at least reasonably good chicken rice, and it was anything but. So like quite a few other reviewers, this was our first and will be our last visit. Sorry."
"Patronized this stall for many years. So disappointed with the big drop in standard. Steam chicken meat is tough , rice taste like plain rice and soup not boiled long enough. Young owner has an attitude. Will look for better chicken rice elsewhere"
Don't know what is the hype about this chicken rice stall.. is really normal and nothing to shout about. As if the soup + ah char is free but in fact already factor into the price.
Been patronising this stall since decades ago. Always have the most generous amount of food. The soup and the acar (vegetable pickle) are free flow. Soup have ingredients inside unlike those pepper soup elsewhere. A 1 person set like this cost $6.70.
"There was a queue but manageable. Seats are limited , so sharing is Required."
Smooth chicken meat. Nice place for lunch. Come early to avoid waiting time
Boneless chicken rice got bones. Rice not yellow anymore. Free achar and soup make this chicken rice stall a stand out. The handsome cashier is a bonus too.
$6.70 for the set. Value for money and super yummy!
"Chicken Rice (SGD $5.90) @ Katong Mei Wei.
.
Formerly known as Delicious Boneless Chicken Rice since their founding in 1989, 2nd-generation owner (and actor/dancer) Soki Wu carries on the family legacy serving fresh, boneless, and delicious chicken rice.
.
Both versions of their chicken, poached and roasted, fare much better because of the robust gravy, lending meaty salty savoury sweet flavour to the freshness of the tender chicken. Enhanced with crispy fried garlic chips with vegetal salty savoury spice notes.
.
The rice tends towards dry and fluffy, with mild grainy sweet flavour. But for this price, you also get a large bowl of double-boiled vegetable soup, filled with chunks of soft stewed cabbage and carrots with vegetal sweet earthy peppery spice flavour.
.
Also included is a unlimited serving of fresh crunchy juicy achar (cucumbers, red onions, pineapple, red chili) with bright vegetal tangy sour sweet spicy flavour, shiok."
Very nice boss
"This chicken rice stall inside the mini food court has been here for decades. Tasty chicken, fragrance rice and very generous with the soup and acar. They have upgraded to an electronic queue numbering system where after you ordered, you wait for your number on your receipt to be called to collect your food. There is also a remote machine at the door of the food court where you could place your order."
Rice was superbly fragrant. Nicely deboned broiled chicken and came with aromatic fried shallots and spring onions. Overall a good plate of comfort food
"Post COVID, Malaysian Chicken shortage, the quality seems different. The taste, I find to be underwhelming versus what it was before. And it's not brimming with garlic anymore. Hopefully they bounce back to how it was."
"It's delicious! But it's NOT boneless.

Update: Chicken rice $5.90 each plate. I could asked for non breast meat. Includes soup and achar as of July 2021.

Update 2: July 2022 price increase now $6.90 for the individual set. Chow Ah Gua no longer around. Service improve a bit. Very good queue system. Up them one more star.

WARNING: don't tapao. Their tapao version is horrible abs they charge for soup abs achar.

Still a bit of attitude. Still the notorious chow ah gua manning the cashier. Stingy in giving sauces."
"Where chicken is a rare commodity  in 2022.
Seriously good! No pix guys, too hungry and  delicious."
Perfect cold plated chicken with fragrant rice and spicy garlic chilli
"Fast and friendly service, rojak is nice too."
Great taste. One of the better chichen rice stall
"Chicken got chicken smell. Food is normal, nothing fantastic. Only best part is the soup. As delicious as ever."
"The cabbage soup was good and 5 stars go to the soup. However, the chicken rice was so so, the rice is not fragrance enough. Will comr back for the soup and acar."
"Where do I begin? It felt like I was eating bones with every mouthful. Honestly, that was such a bad experience. Rice is barely fragrant, chicken is dry. And there was not even much meat on the chicken. Kind of a disgrace to chicken rice if I'm being honest."
Excellent chicken rice (although wasn't so sure about the addition of spring onions) and generous serving of cabbage soup on the side. Would order again!
Though the frozen chicken texture can be tasted. Yet the archa and the flavour full broth of cabbages does give the extra ump!!
6.70 for a plate of chicken rice with chicken that tastes like nothing.
"Went for the Katon Mei Wei Chicken Rice. It was a really long wait, but the whole set was delicious. Came with free soup if you ordered enough. It also comes with free fruit dessert."
Standard drop. Chicken rice   not nice .
The chicken rice is quite good. The Achar they give (I consider) alot for one pax eating. However waiting time was like close to 1 hr. Not really worth the wait.
"went to KTMW after hearing about the ban on chicken. was very excited as it was the best chicken rice in Singapore. but severely disappointed. the rice isn't fragrant anymore, ah zar too sweet, chicken feet too sweet, innards also has a sweet taste. chicken isn't as smooth. so disappointing. I heard the son took over the business, hence the standard of food dropped. why put so much sugar in everything? the ah zar used to be sour tangy and slightly sweet.

the Q was 1 hour long which I didn't mind if they maintained its standard.

please bring the good old standard back again. stop taking short cuts."
The chicken is soft and tasted sweet because of the soy sauce. The soup is nice and the achar is good palette cleanser. The wait for the chicken rice is about 45mins.
"I have been coming here for close to 15 years, I was there on saturday as this is a place I need to come before going back to US. It is great that the young owner had upgraded the technologies to increase its sales, but while waiting there for more than an hour, I realised that somehow they priortised all the online delivery orders over the customers who are physically waiting there (based on the speed of turn over for its online orders). Plus the queue was insanely long that day. The staff carried the roasted chicken across the kopitum without any cover or whatsoever when they require replenishment, I saw that twice. It is extremely unsanitary given how crowded the place was. Taste is good, but next time I wont go there in person just do grabfood. If your business want to serve online customers, then extend the stores like other poplar stores in Singapore..one for online and another for walk in., the queuing system was unfair"
One of the best chicken rice for more then 30 years
"Have been visiting this stall for a few times, chicken is tender, and love the complimentary soup and archar.
As always, there isn't any smile on the staff's face so don't expect any customer service from them."
Excellent best chicken rice in Singapore. The portion are huge and . The chicken texture is great and tender
"Mu Qian Jue De Xin Jia Po Zui Hao Chi
You Hua You Nen De Ji Fan
Mei Ci You Peng You Cong Guo Wai Lai Du Dai Ta Men Qu Chi
Dan Sheng Yi Hen Hao Yao Deng Yi Zhen Zi"
Average chicken rice. The soup given was generous. The chilli and ginger condiment lacks punch.
"Easy to locate. Good food. Great taste.
The chicken rice (both fried and boiled) is yummy. The quantity is good too! I love how they serve a big bowl of broth or soup for orders of 2 pax or more when placed together. Quick service and tasty warm meal! Loved it!"
"Very nice chicken and soup, overall a great set."
"One word. SEPAP!

Very generous portion for a standard chicken rice set. They have really great chilli to go with it too!"
Nice but not easy to find seats for dine in
The soup and ahchar is free flow. And the chicken is soft and tender. Great taste and nice. The chili is mix well with the chicken too.
"Soup was too peppery, rice and chilli was decent"
Just came back to Singapore after it opened up since the covid days. Still my favorite chicken rice stall after all these years!! All the best!
Really power we went there only left Shao Rou but not so good.The charsiew and chicken rice then bagus
"Finally managed to come to this famous chicken rice place.  Had high expectations after reading so much about them. Frankly a little disappointed , perhaps my expectations were too high.  The rice and chilli were fragrant and nice.  The chicken was the best as the chicken skin and flesh were soft and tender.  Overall a very good chicken rice dish but it was somehow missing some fragrance or taste.
Roast pork was very lean but the skin was not crispy.
Soup was fantastic"
"$6.20 Generous portions. Extra touches to it as compared to other basic chicken rice like plates of pineapples, cabbage chunks in soup, fried crispy garlics."
"The flavours were melting on my tongue!

Hands down one of the best hainanese chicken rice I've ever had and indeed, foodking good I guess.

The chicken was soaked in a very savoury sweet sauce, and it's super tender. The rice was fragrant and wasn't too oily.

It came with a bowl of what I believe chicken stock soup but it had a herby taste to it. What I like is the free acar that comes with it, really elevates the chicken rice experience.

Missing 1 star because the people serving us were quite cold/angsty "
Still as yummy as the first time I had even after they revamped their storefront.
Long queue n decided to eat next door ipoh hor fun which has worhei n pretty tasty. My last experience of this chicken rice stall is their disappointing rice that is half cooked.
"To be fair, i have always like their chicken rice cos of the pairing with achar and soup. Their lotus root soup was my favourite.

However, today's experience was bad. I ordered roasted chicken breast with pork rice $8.20. When i told the auntie with short hair that its not chicken breast, she insisted it is. I asked her again if shes sure it is chicken breast, she checked her system and told me that my order was not recorded as chicken breast.

Their store might be popular but customer service is lacking."
"Standard dropped. Used to be quite nice, but lately the rice is getting harder and the chicken not as flavorful. The price is also one of the highest for a hawker,  and after the price increase it is $6.20 for a normal plate of Chicken Rice, i expected more."
"Overall their quality is still good.  Crowded but thanks to numbering system. However,  the coffee shop is dirty and run down."
Over-rated. Expensive $37 for 1 whole steam chicken. So called free soups and  ah-char were factored in the chicken price. Food qualities not as before.
"Just moved around here and discovered this amazing gem after hearing friends tell me about it. My husband used to eat this at his previous work place and raved about their yellow rice.

Ordering is easy with iPads around the air conditioned hawker centre.

I personally think almost every single dish of theirs are good and combined, became great. Firstly the chicken is tender enough even for their roast breast meat ($6.20 with rice). They are also generous with portions and not shrink the chicken meat like other stalls. You get cucumber and fried garlic on top with fresh spring onions - love those details.

Their highlight / differentiating factor with other stalls would be their huge peanuts and ribs soup that they give complimentary (or cabbage version if you prefer), and traditional Asian pickles (achar), which provides a refreshing start to your meal.

Do ask for ginger and dark sauce to compliment everything. I ordered their veg and it comes with abalone slices too. Honestly it's truly value for money and their service speed is super quick even during lunch time and you can generally find seats easily now that restrictions have been lifted.

Have visited a few times since and their rice seems to be getting less yellow haha not sure why but I still like it."
"This place always crowded, difficult to find seat. My wife and I decided to give it a try today despite the high price for one pax $6.20..
We were disappointing. The steam rice is not flavorful, chicken meat quite small portion, cabbage soup not bad but too peppery and achar is like not to our liking (pain one like those serve with satay;  pineapple, onions and cucumbers). Conclusion, not worth the price.
I think any hawker centers chicken rice stall one plate $3 taste better."
"It has been a long time since I visited this shopping centre and the hawker stalls.

Ordered 1/4 steamed chicken, bean sprouts with salted fish and the lotus soup and 2 plates of chicken rice.

The rice and chicken were really great and tasted delicious. The bean sprouts were crunchy and had a generous amount of salted fish in it. The best that I have tasted to date.

The achar and soup were also great.

As it was a Sunday, it took about 25 mins to queue up and get the food. It was a worthwhile wait though as the food was great.

Definitely worth repeat visits."
"Used to be a fan of them. Recently went to eat there. Price increase was acceptable given the expected quality. However I ordered the white chicken.. and it was pungent and tasted bad, almost wanted to puke. Pretty disappointing. Hope it is a one time thing."
"A pack of chicken rice for almost $7 bucks .. after eating, I don't see any difference.. guess this is over priced ""!"
"1st time purchase 2 boxes Take-Aways. Felt short changed, not worth for Take-Away as no Ah Char or Soup given for Take-Away. Discovered none of those given only after opening the opaque paper box after reaching home. Chicken rice is normal only (with bits of bones), not worth the queue nor the wait and hassle of travelling to location. For the price, could have gotten added chicken+eggs at the coffeeshop nearby minus the queue."
Food is not too bad but a like pricey.
Best chicken rice ~
"(Edit: I was the one who insisted and suggested that the new order was sent to me if not a full refund. I had to do the recovery myself.)

It was horrible. We have been patronizing them frequently and we ordered from their website directly. However, the wrong order came which amounted to about $20. Hence i went to check my account but it said that it has been completed. I called them to inform about the wrong order. My order was about $50+ in total. In addition, the delivery partner was under them directly, but the wrong order was meant to be under Grab.

Guess what they told me? They told me they have no choice and it's because of the delivery partner who didn't take the correct order and hence sent it wrongly to us. The person still told me that she would refund $30+ after deducting the wrong order's $20. I was very bewildered. Why did I still need to pay for the wrong order?! What's next was that they asked me if I could come and pick up instead. I paid $14 for the delivery costs and they still wanted me to head down and collect it myself with no mention about compensation. The person was also very rude. She listed down my order, and asked what order was sent to me. Just as I was about to tell her, she cut me off and said ""no no just now what I said was your order, I'm asking what order was sent to you"". I was like ?! and told her off, that I was about to tell her but she cut me off halfway. Subsequently, I refused to and said that I just want my order to be sent to my family or a full refund. In the whole conversation and call, the person was never apologetic about it and continues to put blame on the delivery partner and I had to answer for someone else's error as the customer. They were also never once wanting to do any sort of service recovery and kept saying ""no choice"".

I felt that it was also very dishonest that they knew about the wrong order being sent and yet still updated on the system that the delivery was completed. When I called them, they were quick to find out that I got the wrong order; the person didn't have to take time to check. So it goes to see how poor the service was and I'm truly disappointed by this ordeal. I don't think I'll ever order it again."
"The Acha was nice. Chicken and rice was so so. My chicken came full of bones, not boneless like the signboard suggested."
Best Chicken Rice.
"My favourite chicken rice in Singapore, with 2 caveats:

1) you must have time to wait and dine in because you get soup and achar
2) you need to get there before 7pm because they sell out

Small touches I love:
1) the soup of the day, as pictured, is always delicious
2) the fried garlic that they generously sprinkle on the 
3) the continuous improvement, like the kiosk to place orders

Everything just comes together with the chicken, chili and rice for the ultimate experience (TBH I think the rice is only average)."
"$6.30 for steam chicken rice, Big portion, chicken is soft and tender, soup is flavourful. Value for money"
I can say I lived at Katong area for about 20 over years till now... so much changing of the rice and chicken..kinda miss their old days flavour and taste... more fragrance and fluffy...and the chicken in the past much better too.. pretty sure love their soup and refill achar. Not sure if became too famous and they forgot to keep the standard like it used to be and the soup now too peppery... Used to be a regular but not anymore.
"The chicken was juicy and tender..and the soup was very very tasty..it a must try dish..but dont order their roast pork..skin was not crispy and taste like it keep overnight..not a good choice.btw,there was a katong yong tau foo there..their laksa was nice too..if u going in group.can order their yong tau foo with laksa soup..u wont regret..anyway..if u gi katong shopping centre..must try the chicken rice. 2 thumbs up..."
Stop lying to yourselves folks. Doesn't taste like what it was before the handover. Almost any chicken rice stall taste better than this
"Ordered roast chicken thigh set, taste was so-so.. extra star for the soup and archar."
"PSA: Was told only orders >$7 are eligible for the peanut soup. $6.20 for an ordinary plate of chicken rice with some achar and cabbage soup, I will leave you to decide if it's worth. Not to mention there's a queue..."
"Slightly above average chicken rice stall.

Steamed white chicken is tender and has a layer of gelatin under the skin, slathered with a flavourful sweet soy sauce that's and topped with fried garlic. The rice is not very tasty and not aromatic. The chilli and ginger is overly processed and unmemorable.

Queue is fast moving.

If you are not nearby, don't need to go all out of the way to try this.

Many neighborhood chicken rice stalls are probably as good if not better."
I prefer their roasted chicken to their steamed chicken. The skin is so crispy and goes so well with the fried garlic toppings; the taste instantly got elevated!
"Service : self service
Food : 2 stars
Mains : the price increased about $0.90 but the food I had that day was really disappointing. Not to mentioned that we waited about 30 minutes which is fine. However, steamed chicken breast was fibrous and tough as compared to what I remember it to be. Their roasted chicken was not as juicy as it used to be. In fact they did not debone it properly as well. The rice barely had the fragrance anymore.
What more to say, the soup is no longer tasty, it's filled with pepper and it just felt peppery. The cabbage in soup came with the thick big stalk which is not very convenient to eat.
I must say I missed the old taste and the difference I felt that day was deeply disappointed."
"Finally have a chance to try this after years of recommendation from others.
But sadly, its disappointing.
Rice is not fragrant enough and a little too tough.
Chicken portion is generous though, but not that tasty enough.
And it's not cheap as well. $6.20 for a pack of takeaway. But they do give free achar separately.
Conclusion, it's not worth the price.
Wee Nam Kee is cheaper and better. Even Dong Feng Fa at hawker centres taste much better."
"Must try chicken rice stall.The soup and ah char is nice as well.

Value for money"
Pretty good. The taste Has not changed and soup is delicious peanut 
"Above average chicken rice. Good chicken, achar and reasonably priced. Rice not as good as the old days perhaps."
"The best part was the soup and the achar. Damn shiok!
To be honest, other places have better chicken rice.
Service was very fast"
"Very very good chicken rice.

The rice itself is quite good. It may not have the strongest flavor, but I liked that it is not too oily.

The chicken is good. The roasted seemed to be more popular as it ran out before the steamed one. The meat itself is tender and still rather moist even for the breast. I also liked the soya sauce -- which on the sweeter side. The generous serving of fried garlic on top also adds a nice touch to the dish.

The crystal chicken feet is also quite unique. The chicken feet is 'deboned' and it has a texture somewhat akin to white fungus. It is served with the same soya sauce as for the chicken, with an addition of something like a sweet chili sauce on it.

The soup -- which is free -- is also good. There are generous amounts of ingredients inside - lotus root, peanuts, chicken feet, as well as pork. The soup is very tasty and good as an ending to the meal. They also have the clear soup, consisting of cabbage and some meat, with a slightly 'cleaner' flavor.

They also serve free achar, with slices of pineapple, cucumber, and onions inside. It is good to 'refresh' the palate."
"Kinda mad because I feel cheated..

I was ordering takeaway for 3 people with the intention to get 1/4 roasted (wing part) and 1/4 white (bottom part).

The young guy at the cash register said they don't sell quarter chickens with wing, so he suggested I get the roasted by ""portion"" of chicken to get the wing parts. So I said sure, I just need roasted for 2 people.

He ended up billing me 4 portions of roasted on top of the 1/4 white chicken.... This could easily serve 6 people.................

I really don't understand how he concluded I needed 4 portions of chicken and 1/4 white chicken... Felt like I was taken advantage of because I couldn't order in proper Chinese 

Everything else was fine, it was just that lingering feeling of being scammed that really ruined it for me.

Photo features my bill and all the damn chicken that I was left with because we clearly couldn't finish.............."
"Starting price for chicken rice may seem steep at $5.90 per portion but as standard you get achar and soup with liao along with your chicken rice so it works out well in the end. Kinda like a set meal. Chicken and sauce is really good, it has that nice sauce which you don't get with many other chicken rice stalls. Chilli is also good to me with a strong kick. Soup if you lucky will scoop until chicken meat so that's nice. It's good soup and not those boiled chicken water kind compared to other shops.

Aircon canteen, but super crowded at lunch time so hard to get a seat. Overall, if you look pass the higher ""set meal"" starting price of $5.90, it's a pretty decent plate of chicken rice with sides which I would come back again. Probably not my first choice of chicken rice but one that I will definitely visit when I'm in the area again."
I like it my best chicken rice
"One of my favourite chicken rice stalls in Singapore. The chicken was tender, smooth and juicy. Each plate of chicken is topped with some crispy garlic bits. The set also comes with achar and a big portion of lotus peanut soup - so flavourful and satisfying! "
"Well worth the price and long wait. My daughter who usually prefer rice only asked for more roasted chicken, which I take as a stamp of approval."
Generous portions. Great taste.
Lots of flavor and free soups and Acha.  Value for money and excellentas a whole package.
"Taste is good with free achar but the price can gone up in an exobident way. When we had it years ago, it was $3.50. Then slowly rises to like $3.80. Now, it's $5.90!!! I felt this rise in prices is way too much for standard of living. So reason why I had only given 3 stars. Otherwise, nice aircon coffee shop that serves nice coffee and tea."
"If you order larger sets, it comes with free soup. Regardless it comes with free 'archar' and the chicken is nice. One of the better ones around"
"Delicious chicken rice. Love their soup. Indeed, the chicken rice is pricey. But what you pay is what you get. Give it a try. I doubt you will regret it."
One of the best chicken rice we love!
"Not the previously ""Best"" in Singapore!
Where to start....

1) Rice is not as aromatic as previous operation but fluffy enough.
2) Chicken seems to lose its ""sweetness"". It is tender but lacks the oomp! (Base on classic boiled chicken)
3) Chilli has enough punch and spiciness.
4) Sides like Ah Char are only FOC if you are dining in. Unlike the past.
5) Soups are not free too for takeaways.

Overall, it's just an above-average plate of Chicken Rice. Border lining forgettable. Sad..."
"Efficient service. Fairly value for money for the price paid. Like the effort and taste in the achar and soup. There is even pork rib in the soup.

Chicken breast a bit tough, drumstick and rice was adequate but not wow. Roasted pork generous and delicious.

Overall, worth a visit."
"Portions were relatively large, but rice was not fragrant enough and some parts even not well cooked. Roasted chicken was very bony and didn't have a lot of meat. Char Siew was quite dry. The lotus soup is good though."
"Tried this today. It's good. We had a takeaway. Ordered it via machine. We tried roasted chicken breast and chicken thigh rice. Love that the chili is not spicy because it's already seedless. I really enjoyed it. There's just too much rice for me. I haven't finished it. But I guess for others it's ok. I saw this btw on one of social media food influencer's post. Worth a try.

Edit: oh upon seeing the reviews here it says it comes with a soup and ah zhar? (Spell) we didn't get one  i just hope they told us.. removing one star for that.."
"I heard about this place online, and  saw the interviews given by the owners. Thought that the chicken rice looked pretty good from videos and decided to head down to give it a try.

Went around 3pm on a weekend afternoon. Crowds were soso.

Service was prompt, and food tasted like your average chicken rice (got half a roasted chicken that came with a soup).

What ticked me off was the pompous attitude of the owner.  Now during Covid, they set up a mini table in front of the stall for collection of food.

So I had requested for an extra saucer of chilli sauce from the  2nd gen owner. The owner delicately picked it up from the pile of pre-prepped saucers behind him, gave me a withering stare, and placed it as close to his side of the table as possible before sauntering away like a peacock. I literally had to stretch at across the countertop to pick it up.

This may seem trivial, but when you can't even scrounge up basic courtesy towards your customers for something so simple, it makes your already average chicken rice taste even more bland."
"Affordable with good service. Most importantly, the taste is great. A dying breed, this stall offers free soup and pickled vegetables. And it's proper soup, NOT those watery artificially seasoned kind."
"Just because it's all over social media and YouTube doesn't mean it's suited for everyone tastesbuds lor. Wonder if these people just say it's nice just to avoid argument with friends.
It's a disappointment.
Shop name stated boneless but my 4pkts of dabao-ed chicken rice was full of bones, mildly flavored chicken and rice. Without the chilli, it's hard to tell its chicken rice. Not sure if it's just bad on this day I dabao-ed or not. But all 4 of us will never know, cos we are never going back again. Not worth the hype. Just go marine parade hawker, any chicken rice stall there tastes better than this."
"Been wanting to try for the longest time so drove all the way from west side on a Sunday. The kiosk machine makes it easy to order n take number. It was crowded during lunch time, waited about 40mins to get my dabao. It is definitely a league of its own. Very garlicky,  saucy + oily. Tbh, I prefer the soy sauce type. A bit pricey for a whole chicken (mix) $36.40! Not boneless leh. Lol. Achar so-so, very generous n chunky. The rice is meh normal. Chilli is nice. Soup of the day only n not much taste although Ingredients a lot. Overall its more just like a fancier chicken rice to me. Won't make me wanna queue for it. End of it it's just very oily."
Complimentary soup and appetizer.. Nice
"When I lived in Singapore as a child, my mom would take me here to eat after school all the time. Still THE BEST chicken rice ever! Love how their chicken (whether white or roasted) is always so tender and served in this delicious sauce that just takes it to the next level.

Insider tip: skip all the Michelin rated chicken rice stalls and come right here."
"Ordered one roast chicken set at $5.90. It came with rice, cabbage soup, chilli, ah zhar and the chicken. 5 star for presentation. Chicken was good but not outstanding. The chicken sauce was on the salty side. The ah zhar has lots of pineapple which I liked. Soup was tasty and good too. Overall, worth a visit when nearby."
"This chicken rice stall is definitely one of the favourites for anyone that loves to eat chicken rice. The chilli is the main crux that made up of the whole set of meal. Without chilli, though is good but seems to be missing out something to make the meal complete.

The stall used to have a previous name. Wonder if it is a change of owners or just a rename.

Definitely deserves a 5 STARS ratings!!!"
Above average chicken!
"Nice steam chicken rice. Nice soup and the vegetables.

There is a kiosk machine at the entrance to place order. This will avoid people queuing inside such small coffee shop."
"Formerly known as Delicious Boneless Chicken Rice, the stall seems to have changed its name to Katong Mei Wei. I came here with my parents on their recommendation. The chicken rice is excellent with free flow achar and rice. The soup is also surrpisingly good!

The service is also really quick, I must say. It takes probably around 5-10 min for an order to be ready.

For Chinese New Year, they're giving out some really cute red packets too."
"Very affordable pricing for the portion and serving of food. The free soup and ah zhar appetiser came as a pleasant surprise.

Very young and enterprising boss! Cute and energetic too. Follow him on his Instagram @ssokywu! "
"Wo Dian De Shi Ji Wei Rou,Ta Gei Wo De. Shi Quan Bu Ji Chi Bang. "
Tasty chicken.
Roast chicken is super good!
"The 1 pax set is reasonably priced considering they give a relatively big bowl of soup and achar.

Rice: Fragrant and not oily, but bit dry and hard.
Chicken: Portion is considered generous with spring onions and cucumber, meat is not smashed which is good. Breast meat is bit mushy. Too much gravy.
Achar: Juicy pineapple. Only taste sweet, not sour at all. Not very authentic achar.
Soup: Hot and with veg bits.
Chilli: Just nice in terms of spiciness. Not oily or salty. Generous portion.

Give a  is my review helps."
Always a great recommendation when you are in the east and want to have a good plate of chicken rice. What separates this place from the rest are the fried garlic and is added on top of your chicken and the soup that is provided. Worth the wait which moves pretty fast.
"Recently went to eat at this place with my wife. Actually it was just yesterday. The shop no longer called Delicious Boneless Chicken but now called something else. Not sure if there's a change in owner. There's definitely something missing in the chicken. The soya sauce isn't the same taste that i used to remember. Also, the were very little garlic. I used to remember they were very generous with lotsa fried garlic and green onions."
Best chicken rice in town.. come with achar n hot cabbage soup..
Very good chicken rice. Recommand roasted chicken. Reasonable price and very fast service.
Best chicken rice package of free flow quality soup and achar
"I came by here on a weekday at around 10.30am, and this was just before the queue started to get real long. Food here can be a little pricey. I paid $20.20 for half a chicken and two rice portions. The achar is not bad, the pineapples were a little sour. I'm impressed that they gave a huge bowl of soup, and this was tasty too. The chilli sauce was not too spicy too."
Don't waste your time. Totally not worth it. $5.90 for a plate of chicken rice. I've tried better ones and the price is cheaper than this. No wonder the queue is not as crowded as before even during peak hour lunch time..
Absolutely best
"The achar and the soup offer is USP and hope they continue it. Price is $5.90 for 1 pax but the portion is quite reasonable. However, the food will not make me come back again. I hope that the management of the food court will improve and change the chairs and tables."
I am not v happy with the old man attitude. He behaves as if we own him money. If he dares to argue back. I will not hesitate to call police. No salad of pineapple. Ask for garlic sauce n was rejected? Chicken is too dry even for drums. Soup is over cook. Oh my goodness. Wonder why so many people can give a full 5 stars rating?
Popular boneless chicken rice stall in Katong Shopping Centre. Always crowded during lunch time and best to avoid the lunch time crowd in order to get a table..
"Staff rude and illogical lol I was told that I can be given a bowl of soup but the lady packing it says that she got no time to pack for me and ask me to pack myself?! Huh? Packing is just putting the container of soup into plastic bag what? Prob won't take up 5 seconds?

Only saving grace is the food which I think it's delicious. If I'm nearby I'll drop by to buy otherwise prob won't go all the way there to buy anymore"
"Taste good but rude
Wei Dao Hen Hao Tai Du Hen Zao"
"Yummy chicken rice at the basement of Katong Shopping Centre!!! The soup served is awesome but at times really to pepperish! However the chicken rice compensates that as it's a really wholesome meal. The owners are generous and would never hold back on giving sauces, extra soup and etc... overall good chicken rice and had it since more than 15 years ago. A must go for chicken rice lover if you haven't tried. Seating space in the food court can be really hard to find during peak timing."
"My favorite chicken rice place in Singapore - sinful chicken fat made chicken rice but worth every calorie 
...
More reviews on @nomninjas on Instagram"
Rice was fragrant and delicious. Chicken meat was well done. Even comes with free soup. Definitely worth a try..
Delicious chicken rice and soup
"I eat there because i saw boneless chicken but all was bone, when i order thigh meat. Also chicken is colder than the usual chicken i have eaten."
1 of the best
"Typically it's 4 stars for me but my latest experience would be 3 stars.

Ordered individual portions for takeaway. I've come to realise it's only above average when you order the chicken portions. White or roast, it's the sauce that makes all the difference.

The individual portioned packets were average. Although generous in serving, both the thigh and breast packs were tough and dry. Needed more sauce on them. We placed our takeaway order using third party apps, not sure if that made a difference but .... disappointed that it didn't come with complementary achar."
Food wise is alright! Just an FYI achar need pay $3 now no longer free. For me they already charge such high prices for the chicken rice alone i lean towards the free soup and achar to make it worth. Also asking refill for anything like own them money like that
"Decent chicken rice. Wanted to eat my usual steamed chicken but the lady at the counter got my order wrong(only realised after I rechecked the receipt when the order came). regardless the roast chicken is okay, above average and the soup as always flavourful and welcomed. should be 3.5 for taste (for roast chicken. FYI I love the steamed chicken) but really downgraded the rating because of the abysmal attitude of the bespectacled lady at the ordering counter. she is curt, rude and basically doesn't seem happy to be there? ordered 2 plates of drumstick rice and was taken aback when she raised her voice and did the 'X' sign with both hands animatedly to say Bu Ke Yi Bu Ke Yi, which translates directly to cannot cannot. I have eaten chicken rice for 2.5 decades, very first time being ""scolded"" for ordering drumstick and also not ""allowed"" despite plenty left. naturally I asked her why as it was such a peculiar rejection - she just continue talking down to me and repeated those Chinese words. plus administratively it wasn't ideal as they have a queue number system but u have no idea how many customers are ahead of u until u have ordered. there were 20 orders before me and I had no idea as the ordering queue was deceivingly short. nonetheless that's really not the gist of this write-up (I was okay to wait) this review is rly for the first point of contact aka the lady taking the order who seems less than happy to be there (hopefully she was just having a bad day...) travelled from bukit batok to katong for such upsetting service "
"I have to say, one of the best chicken rice stalls in Singapore. Period. Chicken was good with bits of crispy garlic which enhances the roast chicken. Portion was huge but then again, they do charge a minimum of $5.90 for this. Daring to charge so much and yet able to attract a long queue. It was already 700 customers by the time I arrive for lunch. That says a lot about this stall. Queue moved quite fast though. The soup was real, not some watered down rip off. Achar was sweet. Especially the pineapple. The chilli was just right. Ginger sauce was so old school. Reminded me of the now defunct Yet Con. It's an entire 3 course meal by itself. Chicken rice with all the works? Yes, please!"
Good value for money. Good food. Seats are difficult due to Covid situation and place being small
"Chicken is very tender and delicious. However I wish the soup has less pepper in it. Instead of cucumber, accompany the chicken with bean sprouts."
Delicious but on the pricier side
"Packed chicken breast rice for lunch today. 5 stars.
Finally got to go there this time. Very friendly staff. Offered us some soup as well. Another 5 stars!

Back again for another take away lunch. We got 4 packets of chicken rice and 1 char siew. The stall operator was really nice and pack one peanut soup and one cabbage soup plus some archar. Dropped off the food for my parents and sister to try today and they enjoyed it."
"Food is still good but the attitude is terrible!!! Been a customer for a long time, but I won't put up with the rude service anymore."
"I think it is good but nothing to rave. I think the rice is made well but not that fragrant. The meat is tender and well seasoned.

The chilli is a little bit on the sweeter side for me. They are quite generous with their chilli portion as opposed to many stalls nowadays.

I really like achar so its good to see them serving their cucumber in achar style. Its sweet and crunchy.

Always good to have soup to go along when eating in, though their soup is a little oily.

It gets easily crowded, so try to avoid peak hours."
"Great tender Boon Tong Kee style chicken, chicken feet was nice as well. Their unique achar was freshly made and a nice counterpoint to the fatty chicken. Soup came in a large bowl with generous helpings of cabbage. Highly recommended."
"Large portions, free soup and achar that come together greater than the sum of its parts"
"This is really really so so so good. The chicken is soft and tender, the sauce is flavourful with unique topping. The soup is good and pepper'ish kind. And got free azhar. Would 500% return to eat this again. Loved it. Have to wait awhile thou, worth it :)"
One of the best chicken rice in Singapore.
"the best chicken rice i have ever had, eventhough i live at jurong i am willing to travel to katong just to have this chicken rice, generous amt of chicken and vegs. whenever i have cravings , this is the first place to think abt . it may be crowded w ppl but its worth waiting for seats"
"Enjoyed a hearty meal here. The chicken meat was really tender and succulent. Also, the achar is a must order. Very zest and whets the appetite. Generous thick cuts of pineapple and onions was so satisfying to bite into. The lotus root soup was boiled to my liking, flavorful and sweet. With a crowd forming perpetually in front of the stall, it is testament to quality food being served here. "
"A little exp but savoury n appealing taste..Smooth texture of chicken pieces.
But seats capacity slightly limited.so mustnt go at peak periods"
My husband and I frequent this chicken rice stall (Delicious Boneless Chicken Rice) and are regulars here for many years. But we were very disappointed by how much bones there were in our chicken rice in our recent visit; very little meat as you can see from our photos . Might have been a change in management as they're wearing a polo t-shirt that says Katong Mei Wei now. We never had this issue on the many occasions previously as all the chicken we ordered were all boneless. Tried to speak to them but they insisted we had to let them know we wanted the chicken to be boneless. Would probably not return
"Good Value, not bad"
Best chicken rice I've had
The normal chicken rice is expensive at $5.90. Its not even a set. Will not eat again.
Excellent chicken rice served with soup and achar. Generous with the fried garlic toppings. Happier than having a happy meal at Macdonalds.
S$5.90 for this whole meal with substantial portions! Damn affordable and the achar is reaaalllyyy good. They accept cashless payment modes too so that's a plus!
My go to chicken rice stall!!! Hands down the best chicken rice in Singapore. Chicken is juicy and tender while rice is fragrant :-)
"Great food at a good price, would recommend having the peanut soup. Must try the achar as well! Now you can order ahead online so skip the queue and order ahead of time "
"I came here quite frequent not purely for their Chicken Rice. I like the fact that it comes with free-flow achar and  I think not many Chicken Rice stalls can match with their peppery cabbage soup!
.
Location: Delicious Boneless Chicken Rice, Katong Shopping Centre Mountbatten Road #B1-85/87, 865, 437844"
"Since my secondary school days, this has been my favorite chicken rice stall for 16 years. However, this is the very first time I've felt disappointed. I ordered a take away at almost 2pm and immediately ate it once I got home at 230pm. Sad to say that the rice is no longer as fragrant as before and the amount of chicken given wasn't a lot too. Their standard has definitely dropped for this packet of chicken rice that was not deboned and costs $5.90."
I cannot say they are the best chicken rice stall but I do appreciate their value adds - generous servings of achar and soups. I ordered takeaways and they still pack an entire box for you. The peanut soup is really good. The guy was also honest enough to stop me from over-ordering.
Favorite chicken rice and must try it you're around Katong. The soup is really good so ask if you are doing a takeaway. Price is very affordable
I'd say my favorite go to Chicken rice in the East.
just regular chicken. Not bad but not really worth a trip
"Due to Food King NOC recommendations I had very high expectation. Tried both white and roast chicken, portion size is good but the sauce (soya with sesame sauce) is just too sweet. Taste like sweet chicken due to sauce. Asked for soya sauce and they gave more more sweet sauce. Rice and soup are good. Achar below average. General review will be not recommendated due to the extreme sweetness of the sauce. Unfortunate "
Different taste compared to normal Singapore chicken rice. Really love it!

One of the best chicken rice in town!! The fragrance of the rice and the delicious chicken that make eater can eat more than what their stomach can fill! Always long queues and very difficult to find a seat at this coffee shop. Current situation with only 2 diners per table and safe distancing management made this coffee shop more airy for dine in but less customers allowed at the same time
Decent chicken rice
Chicken rice is nice but @ $5.9 without adding anything.. I can probably add egg add meat out there. Poor attitude from cashier.
Truly amazing! I hardly ever eat chicken rice but this is hands-down one of the best that I've ever had! Love their soup and achar that complete the meal.
Expensive now 1 set for 1 person meal is 5.9 compared to lastime 5 dollars
Food is nice but delivery to your doorstep sure got something missing from the order.  Order 5 packets and only 4 packets was given? Simple task of responsibility in checking before dispatch out cannot be ensure.  Expect me to pay delivery fee again??
"Sadly, standard really dropped. Truly used to be one of Singapore's best chicken rice stall. How can your soup and achar be better than your main dish?
The rice now is hard, uncooked, grainy and tasteless with an artificial yellow, entirely unfragrant and cheap rice used. Chicken is so darn dry! Last time it was succulent and tender, almost 90% cooked kind of gentleness, now it's just roadkill in a lot of soya sauce and sesame oil. Very very ordinary chicken rice now. Also service is rude, unfriendly and chop chop get lost. Maybe something to do with recipe change and old guard taken over by new tired faces and millenials. Stingy with soup, you have to spend a lot for them to now give you 2 different types of soup. No doubt their soups are good though.  But we don't owe you a living. Please be nicer to your customers. Chicken rice is a dime a dozen. We don't have to eat there just because of good condiments."
It's so good.
"It's no secret that i am a #ChickenRice lover. Let me introduce an unique seller.
#DeliciousBonelessChickenRice (#Mei Wei Qi Gu Ji Fan) of #KatongShoppingCentre is one of rare sellers that gives you FREE #Achar and big bowl of soup with lots of #Cabbage (with some meat). I don't like achar, but this one is different. It's sweet and helps to better digest the heavy and oily food.
.
Of course, the rice and chicken are of decent taste and is considered quite tasty. Worth a try!

"friendly owner, good food, must try their achar..."
"Dined in at this place a couple of months back, had the roasted chicken and it was outstanding. But it was a big disappointment when I came to take away ( 18 June 2021 heightened alert). $5.9 for 1 packet of steam chicken rice and you don't even get soup ? What a scam ? The chicken breast was mushy and hard to swallow.  I recommend eating it when dining in is allowed, if not go else where to get your chicken rice. Really not worth taking away. There won't be a next for me that's for sure."
"the best chicken rice in sg even though a bit pricey
the achar : the rice - outstanding"
"Absolutely satisfying meal with free achar and soup and not expensive. I would pay for the soup even if they charge me - it's that good! And if you need more soup, just go back to the stall and the stall owners will gladly refill it up for you. To be very honest the chicken is not the best, but the tau kuah  and soup is delicious. Overall it makes it a really happy meal."
"I love to eat chicken breast meat, presentation looks good and taste are perfect"
"Good food quality as usual with very tasty soup. However for takeaway, u might want to change the paper bag. It's not designed for heavy food like chicken and soup. The bag snapped within 2 minutes of carrying. Luckily I carried my own reusable bag which I could transfer the food to."
One of the famous chicken rice outlet often crowded with lunch time
"Chicken tender. Nice, and rice fragrant too."
Very good chicken rice. Unique delicious dishes are their peppery cabbage soup and pickles!
Sorry to say I don't know why the food correspondents say the chicken rice so good I visit once nothing special but good crowd.
"Stumbled across this ""boneless"" chicken rice...while picking up Mona Manis banana pie.
- chicken...just so-so, definitely not boneless
- rice, quite unique colour...not oily but lack fragrance
- foc archa...nicely pickled with generous amount of pineapple
- best is spare ribs, chicken claw & peanut soup, refillable "
"We went on a Sunday evening around 6.30pm and shortly after we ordered, the chicken was sold out already. Nice chicken rice that comes with free lotus soup and achar. The rice is not too oily and the chicken is tender and succulent. The achar seems to be freshly made and doesn't taste like the kind with preservatives. The lotus soup is like those you cook at home, which is really nice - not too salty nor oily.

The beansprouts costs $5 and came with 4 slices of abalone (which we thought was really an overkill and someone else mentioned in another review that the abalone is fake). We would prefer a $2 plate of normal beansprouts. Skip the overpriced beansprouts is my advice.

Total damage $19.20 for a 2 pax meal with rice, soup, achar and the plate of beansprouts. Great thing is they accept credit card payment.

Update: went back again to try their roasted chicken and tau kua. Roasted chicken was dry and not as good as the steamed chicken. Tai kua size is big, tasted really moist and good!"
"It's not the best chicken rice I have tasted. I would say above average. What makes it special is the soup with generous amount of vegetables + achar given for free with the rice.

However the people taking order and serving are not very friendly + its far from my home so don't think I will visit again.

There are better chicken rice nearer to my home with friendly service."

Chicken taste delicious!! Soup and condiments are complimentary and refillable! Everything is super reasonably priced!! Will definitely visit them again again and again!
"Still the best chicken rice since my childhood days. Tender chicken meat, hearty soup, chilli with the right acidity and a side of achar that compliments the set meal."
"Young chap at counter invested in taking my order in order to relieve my purse. Felt up-sold at every point of order, no consultation, simply assumed I wanted the biggest portion of things; embarrassing to have to downplay some of his orchestral of my lunch (for a party of four). When expressed my wish for soup to accommodate my dinning companion, he did not help me by telling me it is complimentary and instead sold me as 'Premium Soup'.  With such dexterous fingers and nonchalant air. One is given the sense that if one is being played well and quick enough, one walked off a fool.

Puppyism!

Consequently my appetite was equally relieved as my purse.

Now, to one's opinion of their chicken rice style: the pre-prandial shock and stress of ordering might consequently have prejudiced my expectation; but I might say the reverse; the episode has primed me to coolly and unemotionally tuck in. My opinion is that the flare of offering will suit one if one leans towards sweetness. Everything (meat, starch, condiment salad) is plainly sugared as if pandering to children taste. I was anticipating complexity that I grew up with. instead the sacharinity is a common feature across their fare. Common rate."
"Love the chicken rice, terrific meal"
"$5.90 pax but comes in generous portion of chicken, soup, achar and chilli.

I like that they are not stingy in their portions. Like that give 5 big slices of cucumber or the size of the chilli saucer

The rice is not as fragrant as others but I think it's still not bad. Think of it as heartier version

The soup comes w like 1/4 cabbage and taste not bad too with some peppery taste.
The achar is good. ESP the pineapple. Though it's sweet.

The chilli is the star for me. Very flavourful very nice and has lime sour taste and make it very shiok.

As for the chicken which is the main star. I find it abit lacking in sense that it's not flavourful enough and the meat is slightly dry. Think u can find better elsewhere.

Otherwise as whole package, I do recommend to try once as it's still satisfying as overall package."
"$8 as shown in the picture. Two things I like are the soup and the sauce of chicken. Unfortunately, the chicken was cold and dry. I requested for ji wei which was not supposed to be dry. The boneless chicken title still gives the chicken with bones as you could see from the roasted chicken in the picture. Wouldn't come back here again."
"I thought it should be good since it's so famous but was totally disappointed. It's loaded with msg,  not my type of food plus it's not cheap too"
It's ok not that fantastic
rice not fragrant
Good not great
"+Nice chicken rice.
+Nice soup and achar.
-When busy, sometimes never pack soup, archar and condiments.

Avoid peak hours."
"One of the top chicken rice places in sg.

#BrownManReviews"
"Shou Dao Hen Duo Nian Qing Ren De Xi Huan, Dian Can Ye Shu Ma Hua Ye Ke Jiao Song Can. "
"Abit on the expensive side but to mi it was only an average chicken rice, the stall opposite my block has better chicken rice at only $3.!"
Love it so much it's the best
"The complimentary add-ons and condiments turned a simple meal into a feast. The star of the meal is still the focus and it met expectations. On the other hand, the rice was a letdown as it lacked the fragrance and smoothness it should have if a higher percentage of chicken fat was used. Regardless, still an enjoyable meal."
Very very good chicken rice
"Been a decade and almost forgotten this place.
It is now even more improving in terms of service and able to keep its great chicken rice taste."
Better bring tissue pack cause need chope seat sia super long queue but definitely worth the wait
"Still a very good meal after all these years.

Love the roast chicken. The stall offers free soup with the chicken rice, which they boil for hours using the chicken bones they de-bone from the chicken they sell. They also serve up some complimentary Achar (Local pickled veg and pineapples).

Side note that the chicken rice here is not cheap by local standards, has always been so, and they now allow mobile payments by Visa and Mastercard."
"Generous portions and delicious free soup included with the set, will definitely be back!"
"Love the chicken. Generous amount.
Fragrant yellow rice.. always packed. Do go early.."
"Overall, the portion was indeed generous with add ons like the unlimited flow of homemade soup as well as Achar. The meal is value for money but if we are talking about the main chicken rice dish, I find that the taste of the rice does not pack the kind of fragrant that we usually receive from a plate of chicken rice."
"As it name suggests, this place serve delicious boneless chicken rice. They provide free appetizer (marinated cucumber, pineapple with chilli and onion) they also offer free flow of soup that is tasty and fill with quality ingredient. And the price is very reasonable. This place deserved a 5 star rating for the quality food they provide at a reasonable price."
"Tiny little shop located in the basement of one of the oldest aircon mall of Singapore in the katong/joochiat area serving delicious chicken rice. We tried both the steamed and the roasted chicken. Both soft, tender and moist. The sause/oils were good and portion size for the price we paid, was unbelievable.
The veggies were also good and the mixed pineapple cucumber salad was free flow. The bone broth was a nice touch compared to plain old chicken soup. The only disappointment was the rice as it was a tad too dry but can be overlooked given the delicious meat and veggie. We paid 28$ for 4 pax for all the food you see on the table "
$5.90 set for about 2 person serving. Super value with the acha and rich soup. Serves the crystal chicken feet which I don't see sold often. Must try.
The chicken rice here exceeded our expectations! The rice was not as oily. The chicken was good. The soup was a pleasant surprise. It's not the typical chicken rice soup but we were served lotus root soup. The Achar was amazing too. Kudos to the staff for streamlining their operations. It's not every day you see a self serve kiosk at a chicken rice stall.
Always love this place. The chicken rice comes with soup n achar...really great value for money.
"Good service,  excellent chicken, free soup and archer. Well worth a visit ."
"This place is just good.
Every part of the dish, from the rice to the chicken to the achar to the soup is just good and you can tell the amount of effort  put into their food.

The price and serving is great value even.
All in all a highly competent chicken rice shop, and definitely in my top few places."
One of the most unusually popular Chicken Rice store in Katong. Fragrant rice and chicken. However chicken was not as smooth for that day.
"Ji Rou You Jiao Jing,Xiao Cai Suan Tian Ke Kou,Guan Jian Shi Tang Ye Hen Hao He!"
"A very nice chicken rice stall, dishes are all cooked with effort. Especially surprised by their complimentary chicken soup which is boiled with lots of cabbage and chicken bones! You should try their side dishes like chicken feet, Vegetables and Lotus peanut soup! Oh yes, you have free achar that you can take to eat!"
"Came all the way here for the steamed chicken but upon order they told us there isn't any more steamed. So we had no choice but to order the single roasted chicken displayed. Less than 5 mins after serving the roasted chicken, they took out and displayed the steamed once (picture)!?!? They could have told us it was being prepared but instead trying to clear the one displayed. It used to be good and worth the price. But now it's not as good as before, overpriced (with 25% price increase since over a year ago) with rude staff, terrible service. Save yourself a wasted trip by avoiding this place."
"Best chicken rice in Singapore. Totally living up to their shop name. I love the soup that comes with it. With the young boss taking over his father, it has become so much more systematic and efficient. "
Good food. Live the veggies
"Crowded, Good food but floor not clean"
"Really worthwhile. The soup given was not the usual plain soup laced with MSG but chock-full of ingredients! I even spotted shredded dried scallops. It was full of flavour. The chicken was delicious and tender. The achar given was the best I ever had, this coming from someone who does not usually take achar."
"One of the nicer chicken rice I've had in SG both white and roasted. Most meals comes with complimentary cabbage soup and ""Ah cha"" (preserved cucumber, pineapple, onions which is slightly spicy)."
Tried the chicken rice a few days ago. Ordered the set which was around $6.90. Rice was ok. Ordered roast chicken not bad. Came with a large bowl of cabbage soup but a bit too peppery. Achar was good - came with big chunks of pineapple. Came during 1pm+ on weekday - not easy to find seats as it's crowded during lunch hours. Overall ok - probably can try one time if u have yet to try their chicken rice.
"Superb chicken rice tucked away in basement 1 of a seemingly unsuspecting shopping center. White Chicken was tender and juicy. Rice was steamy, fluffy and infused with chicken flavours in every grain. Also came with free soup and achar with were great dishes paired with the meal."
1st time trying this. Come with complimentary soup of the day. Unique color of rice with chicken aroma. Friendly staffs. Be expected for long Q during lunch time.
"Nubad. Got chicken, got rice and still got soup "
"Needless to say to me this is the best chicken rice in Singapore. They do all the little things well. Their soup is always awesome. Their azar is nice too. The fried garlic bits on top is just boomzzzz. Try me, try is. You won't regret. Worth every calorie!"

"The chicken was boneless, the rice was delicious.

And free achar!!!"
"Bring your own sauce for peace and harmony !

Packed half a chicken with extras & 3 packets of rice and had to justify black sauce is wanted.
My suggestion is to state your intentions earlier before the packer interrogates you why you need your sauce!

And don't get me started on the chili & ginger.... not sure if that would start a war..  best to bring your own everything!"
Never tried. Was there too early. They open at 10
"Visit this stall after many years of absentee. Was initially shocked at the high price of $6.40 for a chicken drumstick rice. Was quite pleased when the food came with unlimited pickles and a bowl of cabbage soup with chicken carcass. Portion was OK. The chicken was tender and decent. However the pickles was coarsely chopped as if it is feeding more for animals than human. I would prefer if there is more vinegar. Obviously it has mixed with too mach water than I like but this maybe only my preference . The cabbage in the soup was soft, cabbage was coarsely chopped, the carcass looked like it was murdered in a bloody mess. The soup was too peppery and bland to my liking. If the stall tweaked more in the way food is presented I would maybe go back if I am around the area but I think i would give a miss as there are better chicken rice stalls around."
It their special fragrance sweetener sauce... that enhance the flavour into our taste buds... with the portion of choices chicken in the plate... Uncle Mike.
Classic chicken rice with a lot for Acar and ginger dipping sauce fans
"Complimentary soup and achar, what's not to love!"
"Half a chicken with two plates of rice for $20. Free flow achar and soup. The whole chicken from breast to thigh was juicy and seasoned well, garnished with a heapful of crispy minced garlic. Achar balanced the whole dinner very well, cutting through the oils from the soup and chicken. Rice is definitely on the mild end in terms of flavour but compliments well with the chicken and soup. This stall is just amazing value. Worth the detour, the insan rain, 22 degrees cold weather and the queue."
My plate of bean sprouts was delicious. Accepts payment by credit card.
One of the best chicken rice I had. If eating in during peak hour it might not be easy to find a table.
My last visit was almost 1 year ago. Still taste good as always!!
"Best Chicken rice in Singapore, coupled with free double boiled soup."
I think there is too much of a hype to this chicken rice store. Chicken had too much bone even though I asked for boneless. The charsiew was tasty but the sauce was just too much for my liking!
"Tasty chicken rice , delicious archar and hearty generous serving of soup with lots of ingredients."
"Though there are some good points to it, I wouldn't rate this amongst the best chicken rice in Singapore, it's far from it.

Pro : Jelly under chicken skin, fast service, very generous portions, FOC hearty soup with generous ingredients, plenty of cucumbers and achars
Con : Not a fan of their overly sweet soya sesame oil dressing, the rice is not flavourful enough, chilli not the best, foodcourt tables are not very well cleaned, not the most friendly service.

If you are a foreign visitor looking to try Sg Chicken Rice, please do not specially come here for your chicken rice experience. Its taste is not the true representation of Singapore style chicken rice. But if you happen to be in the area, no harm to try."

"Very delicious and shiok chicken rice, one of the best in sg!"
Highly recommended..  it s old traditional chicken rice.
Food is good.
"Best to eat there , if order from grab/foodpanda or takeaway. From boneless chicken rice become full of bones rice."
"Nice: Probably top 10 chicken rice.
Rice is fragrant. roast chicken not too dry. super soupy that's tasty and of course the home made Ar char. just prepare for a long Queue And not superb service. but who cares if you are a chicky  chicken fan to carry on Makan."
"We have been coming back since we tried it a year ago. Love the fragrant rice, roast chicken and best of all the fried garlic."
"The chicken is nice, the rice if Abit more fragrance will be nice, eggs and tao gu dun need try la"

Visited this place due to the reviews. Worth it but it was crowded during lunch hours!
full of msg
Favourite chicken rice of the East
chicken gravy and fried garlic goes well
One of the best chicken rice in Singapore. The soups are fantastic as well.
"Today will be the last day for me to drive down purposely to eat from this store.

I came to this place to buy half chicken and rice during CB and the charge was $17++ and to my surprise, when I came and order the same half chicken with rice today, the charge was $20++, difference by almost 20%. Worst of all,  the staff were all very rude from the way they talked as if customers owed them.

Service getting from bad to worse, sorry no more next time thanks for the good old days !!"
"Came here on a sunday and as usual this place is packed! Had to queue for:
(1) table, (2) order, (3) collect the food
They seems to have a certain system esp for (2) and (3) which works (eg one pax in queue, order taken while queue).
Food is good here. Price is very reasonable. You will get free soup and acar when you dine in. Beware not to over order as everything just looks darn good!"
bean sprout $8 which is expensive in a coffeeshop already told stall is 2a2c yet they still wana chop us a big plate of bean sprout.  Don understand why reputable shop need to do that.  Don recommend at all
Best  in the East!
not very nice
In my opinion the best & great value for money chicken rice in sg!
"Yummy yummy yummy.
For 5.90
U get a big portion of rice, chicken, soup and achar.
Because of the high sales, food is fresh.

The only down side, it's hard to get seats"
"Everyone likes free stuff, and they offer 2 types of soup (lotus pork rib & cabbage chicken) , together with pickled vegetables (achar). Their have fragrant rice with smooth chicken. Serving portion is generous, with quite a lot for a cheap price."
Soup is the main attraction
Delicious chicken rice. Comes with free soup.
"No regrets driving from West side to try. 1st time trying after reading lots of reviews online. Although $18 for half chicken is rather steep, but you get a whole plate of aceh and 1 big bowl of lotus root soup. Steamed chicken is soft and smooth. Rice not as fragrant as i expected and chilli does not pack a sour punch. Overall 4 stars for the generosity of the stall owners. Although queue was long but ordering and food out is pretty fast."
"Certainly one of the best around.

Came on a weekday afternoon and the place was crowded. So do come prepared to wait at least 20 mins to place an order and a subsequent 10 mins to collect your food. Seating is limited as well.

The chicken rice is amazing. Rice is fragrant and flavourful. I really enjoyed the chicken. I was able to try most cuts of the meat and found them all really tender and flavourful. The soy mixture that the chicken was drenched in was very flavourful and added another dimension to the dish.

The chilli had a good consistency and I really like how it blended so well with every other element of the dish. It had a nice and lasting heat to it too.

The soup that came with the dish was flavourful and packed full of ingredients - almost a dish on its own.

This chicken rice is not cheap. It is not a typical hawker offering either. With the purchase of two portions, I received almost half a chicken, a large bowl of soup and a side of archar. Both the archar and soup are refillable. What you do not get is a more comfortable setting or table service that will typically come with the price tag. That said, it is still an excellent deal overall."
Not bad.. worth trying if you are at katong area..
Fell short on my expectations. The rice is so dry and lacking in flavor. Nothing impressive about the chicken. Lots of better chicken rice options in sg. Free soup was good though
"Pros: Generous serving of chicken and additional serving of salad.
Cons: Relatively expensive ($5.90) for chicken rice at a food court, difficult to get seats during peak hours, more so with the safe distancing measures kicked in."
Still the best chicken rice place. The tender chicken and yummy soup (which is free!).
Love the chicken rice but the free soup and acar that comes it is icing on the cake!
"Solid chicken rice if you are around the east. Chicken is smooth and flavourful, good hearty soup that comes with any side dish ordered.

Overall, I will not drive across the island just to eat this but it definitely tops the list of places that will come to mind when I want to eat chicken rice. :D"
Totally loved the meal just a little pricey but otherwise it's
Tried their chicken rice. Didn't find it fantastic! The bonus is their free flow soup and achar.
"heard much about this place. so ordered to try. big shock it was $6. no wonder there was no pricing on the signboard anywhere.
tasted so-so. yes chicken is thick and somewhat moist, but overpowered by the sauce, very salty. fried garlic bits is a good touch. rice is ok, portion is small. also achar is nothing special. all the pieces are cut so huge, difficult to eat for small kids. service was lousy. thought i went to wrong outlet as didnt see achar. asked about it and the staff just pointed rudely to the covered counter. soup was too peppery. lots of white pepper thats it. for $6, i say i can get better chicken elsewhere. no need free soup or achar."
"I'll say its still a good chicken rice..

After about 10yrs im back here from the west. I remember it was the best chicken rice i had at that point of time. NOW... as compared to 10yrs ago the standard had dropped greatly. Rice was not firm enough so texture was not great. Soup was cold at dinner time around 7.30pm? Wth? Why is soup cold during dinner serving?

Shop name says boneless, so i was expecting it to be boneless but i was wrong. They just chopped the chicken up and serve it with all bones intact. Not sure if we have to request and pay extra for debone.

So whats still nice will be the chicken, tried the roasted chicken, unlike normal roasted chicken where the meat are all dry, this one is still tender and with the gravy its so good.

I will say with the standard now, its kinda disappointing and i will not travel from west to here. Will probably be back to try again if i happens to be in the area."
Drop by e place for a late lunch where lunch crowd was over. Food wise is still ok with e pickled pineapple n cucumber plus e cabbage soup. Ordered a steam white chicken drumstick. Total bill is S$6.40.
Excellent chicken rice. But may not be very accessible if you don't stay near east coast/marine parade region.
"Went to Katong for the banana tarts in the same complex and saw people recommending this eatery, so I decided to give it a try.

Ordered a portion of steamed chicken breast and roasted chicken thigh pricing at $11.80. Asked about the soup when only the achar was served and the boss jokingly said ""why you no ask?"" 

White chicken breast was tender but the roasted chicken thigh had very little meat. Not exactly a wonderful chicken rice making it price wise a tad bit costly. The soy sauce accompanying the chicken adds flavour at the right amount and I loved the achar as it cleanses your palette and makes the meal a more balanced diet but the soup was too salty and peppery.

Packed another roasted chicken thigh rice for a colleague and he mentioned that the meat tasted like breast meat. Probably dried out after the journey but he mentioned rice did not turn oily over time."
Tried d 1st time n luv it. But i think white chicken would be better. I ordered white but it came in black
"Used to visit this place in the past, but sadly the standard has dropped quite a bit.

The rice was hard and lacked the fragrance which made it unique and appetising. I'll give the benefit of doubt that may it was just the time I visited. The chicken was cold, probably lower than room temperature.

Price also increased quite abit (roughly $4/5 dollar increase compare to precovid), especially if you buy a half chicken set. Would probably visit again, though it is not as enticing as it used to be."
"It's unbelievable, in general, i am a rice hater but i really love coming here for chicken rice! It's the only chicken rice store that I will recommend to anyone."
"$5.9 is a reasonable price up pay for a set of chicken rice. Individually plated fragrant rice, salad, soup, a generous serving of chicken.

Ordering via app is a great idea if you want to locate a seat before placing your order."
"Don't even bother making the trip. Standard dropped till there is no redeeming quality plus the attitude of the people working there takes the cake. ""we ran out of this and this...Take a look yourself at whats available"" plus we had 2 different orders and they left out the chiili for one of the order. Running a food business without any heart, soul and a bad attitude left a bad and bitter taste in our mouth. Last time we will be visiting."
"Was looking for chicken rice and by chance saw this stall. Long queue to order (can order online), pay and collect. Was told it's good. Cost $5.90 one packet of chicken (thigh) rice. Disappointed. The rice is hard, not fully cooked. The chilli nothing to comment and the chicken is bland... not worth it."
It keeps the word and its chicken rice is absolutely delicious and worth the 5.50 dollars they are charging. Pity that the court is very small and not that clean. Not to be missed
Delicious and generous achar.
"Unfortunately standards have dropped tremendously. Have visited this place in the mid 1990s, when the boss & wife were there preparing the chicken.

In the past, one could taste the deep flavour in the roast chicken & rice. The chicken now is bland & has none of the fragrance that so captured the tastebuds of the residents & schoolchildren in the Katong area.

There is nothing that truly stands out from other chicken rice stalls now, other than it's long history."
The chicken is boneless and rice is delicious
"Its quite good, but not as amazing as those people on social media claim. The rice can be a bit hard sometimes. Maybe depend on luck? First time i ate was ok. Recently a bit hard. The portioning though, Chicken give damn little HAHA. So its overpriced"
Total cost is $50! Chicken is very nice. The rice may not be as fragrant as other places but overall still love it!
"Had a huge spread of white cold chicken, roasted chicken, char Siew, vegetables (tau ghey), and soup. The chicken is as per expected, delicious and flavorful. Soft and tender especially for the white one. Chili is good. Rich is fragrant. The soup is absolutely flavourful, especially the lotus bean soup. Boneless chicken only when you ask for it. Must try chicken rice stall."
Delicious and hearty meal. Coming back again
"Delicious food. Price a bit on the higher side at $5.90. But considering the nice soup and achar, should be alright."
No big deal...Just like any ordinary chicken rice stall
Portion very big. Stunned like vegetable. Even my size also struggling to finish. I call it as the hungry man's chicken rice.
Worth the money
"One of the best chicken rice I have ever had! The taste really packs a punch and the chicken juices really coats in your mouth! Really enjoyed the fried garlic with chicken and the steamed chicken is super juicy and tender.

Best of all, it comes with free achar and 2 types of soup! What's there to complain about free stuff right? Though it's free, it's a really really good soup. They should charge for it. Hahaha"
"Ordered half a chicken (roasted) and a plate of roasted pork (siew bak), comes with 2 big bowl of old school and homey taste soup (super nice) and a plate of acah.

Chicken rice is surprisingly not as fragrant as it seems... pity...
Chicken is good, tender, very tender.
Siew bak is a little disappointed as the skin is not crispy but chewy (probably left there too long).
Acah, not fantastic, feels like just anyhow prepare without proper marinade.  Definitely a minor pity here.
Chilli is not the best I've tasted, missing a fragrance as a chicken rice chilli should have.
Ginger is not good. Tasteless.
The soups are superb.  Love them.

Overall, very pleasant experience with good quality chicken.  Generous portion with good old school taste soups.

Recommended!"
"Generous portion of boneless chicken meat, nice sauce, soup and free achar. Price has increased from $5 to $5.90 for an individual set. 3.5 stars."
"Not the very best in terms of rice, but can't complain about the smooth, super tender white chicken, or the super tasty roasted chicken. Comes with free soup (lotus pork rib or cabbage chicken soup) and free achar (spicy pickled veg).

The the money you're paying, there's none better in Singapore. Come on off hours or be prepared to queue"
Maybe expected too much
Great portions and taste
"Delicious as always, and always a satisfying meal especially when you eat as a bigger group as the soups and achar comes with the meal, and are delicious! Although I'm sure they alrdy factored the price inside, since it costs abt $48 for this whole table of food for 5 of us. But still worth it as it really makes for a very complete meal. The staff are courteous too, helping us inform the cleaning auntie to help clear our table after the previous occupants left.

The white chicken and roasted chicken are not objectively the bestest in their respective categories, but the white chicken is definitely within the top 10 percentile in my books. The roast chicken is a little more average, but having variety does increase overall enjoyment of the meal.

But we did feel like we got disproportionately more breast meat, which was a little disappointing."
Generous best servings with free acha
The complete chicken rice package.
"Most tender chicken breast meat I ever tasted for chicken rice. Personally prefer their roasted chicken over poached white chicken. Chilli is sour and spicy with kick, plus point is that soup is good. But, rice is only so-so. Generous portion, decent price, waiting time can be very long during peak hour, so try to come earlier or later."
The chicken was tender and rice was very nicely made generous with soup and free ah Cha was a added bonus really enjoyed
"Love the rice
Yummy white chicken
Awesome soup"
Best chicken rice one I have eaten so far in Singapore after spending around 8 months here. The price is really cheap. It is located in the Katong shopping mall. There will be always long queque so it is better to go there Abit early
"Great chicken rice set that's served with a flavourful & peppery soup, and free flow achar!"
"Be prepared to queue. Waited in queue for 15 minutes to order. After ordering, waited again for 15 minutes for my order. Unless you are able to wait for your chicken rice, may not be worth the wait."
Good. Would come again
"One of the better chicken rice in the east  The winning ingredient is their soup  Its just a great combination to the whole deal!!! The rice is slightly yellow in colour looking very appealing, the chicken is not too bad and the serving of the AChar is so generous. If you are in the east, this is the chicken rice for you "
It's BAD (it's actually so good that I don't want to wait behind you in the queue) 
This is one of the best chicken rice I grew up with since young. I live round the corner and would have this once a month because the chicken is tender and smooth. I especially love the soup! One downside of the set is that it is getting more expensive.
"It's a unique type of rice, slightly more yellow than the typical chicken rice, and the chicken is way more juicy and more flavorful than the rest."
"$5.90 for a plate of chicken rice with cabbage soup, pineapple and cucumber pickles. Rice is fragrant with the chicken favor. Pineapple pickles is nice, 4 stars because it is a bit over priced and it is not really boneless per said. The chicken meat I had still had the ribs bone on it."
Affordable and delicious!!! Free flow dessert.
Did a take away for 2 chicken rice. Each chicken rice had 1 drumstick and 2 wings as I had asked. Spent close to $25 for that. I think i was overcharged? In any case taste wise was average. You probably could get a better tasting chicken rice at a regular coffeshop. And probably better price too. I heard about this place from a few people and they said it was good. I dont know maybe they were having an off day cause i wouldnt recommend it to anyone especially for charging over $12 for 1 chicken rice with 2 extra chicken wings?
$36 for a steamed chicken is a tad pricey. Nice sides of pineapple salad and soup were better than most. Will not drive all the way to Katong again for just this purpose.
"One of the best and reasonably-priced chicken rice I've had!! This picture cost us Sgd 28 for 3 pax and the chicken is so so good it melts in your mouth. Free pickled vegetables are served and you can even ask for seconds. The roast pork however, wasn't to our liking as the top part isn't crunchy (as its soaked in the sauce given) so that wasn't to our liking and it was kinda tough. We will definitely be back and this time, sticking the ze chicken "
Nice soup but got transgender dude
"used to be good value and delicious, patronised alot for many years when staying around the area, recent visit during dinner time was surprisingly quiet and turn out disappointing.. standard has dropped, chicken meat given was full of bones with little meat, rice was hard, price hike, not worth to make a trip there again.."
Value for money. Generous portion of delicious chicken rice coupled with crispy pork. Served with with free soup and vegetables. Come early and be prepared to queue.
"I have eaten this chicken rice for more than 10years. It WAS the best. But now, it has degraded into a normal $3 chicken rice that I can get near my place or even worse. They increase their price to $5.90 which made it so not worth it anymore. Higher price with degrading taste. Definitely not worth your time or money anymore. Another Katong laksa type of management which will be the downfall to this place."
"My no 1 favorite chicken rice stall in Singapore. Chicken was very well seasoned, the free soup was so yummy and the pineapple was so sweet and delicious.

The only reason I knocked off a star is  because of the quality of the chicken, sometimes it could be a hit or miss.

Having  said that, the overall combination of texture and flavor was almost perfect!

Wait time could range from 30-45mins during peak hours."
"Was recommended to this place by a regular delivery uncle. No regrets. Rice is fragrant, chicken is tender. Special mention to the soup and the Achar (pickle) which came as a set. Go early. Queue is damn long."
Fantastic value and quality!! Its far away n parking is a pain...but the chicken rice in the basement.....plus plus plus!!
"I love the acar side dish (usually chicken rice side dish is soy beans).
The half chicken was tender and juciy (big portion surprisingly).
Today soup was peanut lotus. Very rich and yummy. We love it.
Bean sprouts was over salty due to the topping.
Char Siew was normal. (I will recommend to try the chicken).
Even the queue was long but the waiting period was still acceptable."
Been told by many friends this is the best. Personally I don't find this the best but it is one of the top fews. Had it a few times and sometimes can be hit or miss. Recently ordered whole chicken and the chicken was bloody and bruised in the inside
Very good. Worth the money
"Food is amazingly affordable with huge portion size. Could see the effort in making the food as the ingredients used are a lot!

The chicken came with archa and lotus root soup, both are amazing.

Now, things I ordered:
- glass chicken feet, would like more heat, but over all decent, a little to the salty side.
- bean sprouts, at 5.50. Its overpriced.
- quarter chicken- not the best I've had, got the chicken breast portion, slightly over cooked
- rice, not as fragrant as most but still decent

Total cost of meal is 24.60, so it's very very affordable for the amount I've paid."
"The service of this place is really getting from bad to worse and it wasn't like this before until recently. Their staff, especially the son who is acting all diva, is really curt and rude to customers as if we owe them a living.  Used to enjoy this place for many years and disappointed to see it turning out like this."
"The chicken rice is not as good as before. We ordered a whole steamed chicken with vegetables to share among 5 pax on a Sat afternoon. The chicken was dry and not flavourful/tender/juicy like it used to be. The rice was also not good, not firm and broken, tasted bland and mushy. Very disappointed to know that their standard has dropped so much! Only items which remained good as before was the soup.."
"They have above average chicken rice but the real highlight in my opinion is the free soup. You can taste the flavours of the ingredients infused into it. And it is not a small portion, it is quite big.Overall a solid chicken rice meal"
Half-decent quality. Sullen and borderline-rude hawkers. Poor attitude. Long queue. Will only return if there's nothing else to eat.
"Best chicken rice ever. Dine in, u can enjoy free achar & soup. Serving portion is generous. I've been patronizing them for very long & my family love the food as it's really very delicious. Food Preparation was done by the boss himself 
Strongly recommended"

"The chicken is delicious, tender and juicy with free refill of the soup"
"The chicken rice does not seem as tasty as I remembered even though I was pretty hungry. The sauce is same as before, tasty soya sauce for the chicken and chilli was great. But this time round I did not have the chopped vegetable. It used to be free flow. Nothing special about the chicken n it is a bit on the dry side. If the sauce isn't there, the chicken is totally not delicious. The rice tasted blend, used to be a lot more fragrance n tasty. Standard drop so only star."
"Decent chicken, but the rice I had was undercooked.. for any self-respecting chicken rice stall that's unacceptable"
Bu Hao Chi
"On a weekend, the waiting time for your food to arrive is around 45 minutes.
2 pax meal can be around $14 with ""Free soup and Freeflow achar""
Chicken is a bit tough and you have to remember to ask them to debone as it is an optional service. Rice colour was quite unique but was tasteless."
It wasn't as good as before. The owner was a bit rude to the customers and wasn't as cheerful as before.. The chicken had too many bones... While before only had a few...
Management changed.... style changed... attitude also changed... portion also changed.... soup given portions also changed ... no good changes (except the ordering system)....rating from me also changed...
"The chicken rice is good, very juicy and tender.
The soup provided by the chicken rice stall is unlike others. Full of ingredients. Not those cabbage soup. But have lotus soup and all. Free of charge."
No more delicious
One of the best chicken rice in the East!
Great chicken rice
Yummy chicken but not much difference on the roast and white ones. Very affordable and comes with soup and veggies!
Worth the wait for the delicious soup and gorgeous chicken
"Went to try the famous chicken rice stall in Katong Shopping Centre. Already a queue at 11.10am and managed ordered their roasted chicken pretty quickly. Was pretty impressed by the quantity of chicken given but however the rice is towards the drier and less fragrance kind of chicken rice. The roasted chicken breast is soft and slightly mushy, and the sauce is not as savory as I thought it would be. However the soup given was really tasteful and delicious! Overall a decent dish of chicken rice but because I had high expectations of it due to the popularity and recommendations, I was rather disappointed because I tasted better  hence only 3 stars..."
"It's a hidden Secret in the midst of a very old
Shopping CENTRE.  This chicken rice stall can be classified as amongst the best in the east of Singapore.
And the special soup and the even special Achar that plus on... it makes it a wholesome meal. Salad , soup and a main course.
Roasted chicken, decent and crisps with fried garlic bits that give you that crunchiness.
So why wait , dropped Katong  to discover
This unique chicken rice stalls.. another couple of secret within this grand old dame.
A care and a dessert store????
're discover to carry on Makan."
"Good chicken rice. The waiting time for me at 1130am (weekday) was about 30mins. 15 mins to queue to order (stand to queue), and another 15 mins (sit at table) to wait for my order to be ready. They are very busy both with walk in as well as Grab orders so be sure to check your receipt what was keyed in. I didn't check and got roast chicken instead of the white one that I ordered as it was keyed in wrongly. Still tasty."
One of the best chicken rice in Singapore
The only Chicky Rice in SG that comes with achar and soup that you will otherwise not associate with traditional chicken rice - worth the queue whenever the cravings hit.
"Splendid chicken rice. Crispy garlic on is a wonderful touch, good quality soup. Nothing about this meal disappointed"
Popular and for good reasons. The meat is good and oddly the soup is best
"Great food, friendly staff...you get way more side dishes as you normally would with chicken/rice food stalls...small table spaces to eat can be cramped if there are crowds..."
One of the best I've tried in Singapore
Good Food. Love the meals! Thank you
Pretty good. Portions are larger than usual so makes up for the slightly steeper price :)
FOOD KINGGGGG GOOOOD! @foodkingnoc via Instagram
"This used to be good and well worth the long queue, because the soups served were delicious and varied. Sometimes we got lotus with peanut soup, and more often cabbage soup with lots of ingredients. These days, the soup and the free-flow achar remain their top-selling factors, but the rice is often hard and not well cooked enough."
Heard so much about this Chicken rice but no WOW from me. They serve decent chicken rice but there are definitely better chicken rice out there that doesn't cost this much. The thing that steals the show is the free flow Achar. Am not a fan of Achar but theirs is fresh and tasty.
Standard has dropped tremendously since I last visited 2 years ago. Price remained higher than standard chicken rice stalls which I was fine with when they were still good. Rice wasn't fragrant and was dry. Service wasn't exactly as impressive. Only saving Grace was the fried garlic.
"Been eating at this stall well over 20years. Even after moving away overseas, I'll always make 2 or more trips to eat here when I'm in Singapore. Rice is fluffy, oily enough and chicken flavored. Chicken is tender and juicy."
"In terms of chicken, probably still the best chicken of all chicken rice stores. But the rice isn't as nice as it used to be, in fact there are alot of other places that have nicer tasting chicken rice. The soup.. the soup is oh my god good. It's like they've boiled it for 7 7 49 days to get such a flavour. Oh archar is free btw as well. We couldn't finish the soup and pity we couldn't bring it home because its complimentary."
"Update: It's $6 now for one person.

Been eating here for about 6 years. While the rice is clearly not the most flavourful among the other chicken rice places, it's meant to be a healthier option and u feel good after eating it. The chicken breast is very tender and thicc. The soup is way better than the usual lousy chicken rice broth at other places. Free achar is good too. I go out of the way to eat this and it's worth it. Just look at the chicken."
"Immediately, the best Chicken Rice I have ever tried in my entire life. Highly recommended and will surely be back for the Roasted and Steamed Chicken. We ordered their Roasted Chicken (S$5), Steamed Chicken with chicken liver (S$6) and Roasted Pork (S$5). Both steamed and roasted Chicken was awesome and perfect. However, their roasted pork isn't that good. Long queue on lunch time (11:45AM-1:00PM)."
Portion still very good. But taste standard dropped a bit compared to last time.
"Insane soup which is so so well done! We had lotus soup with peanut and it is so good! Very well done and not very greasy. They should open another shop that sell soup only.

The roasted chicken with the garlic is the bomb! Pair with the chicken rice. Omg you are simply in heaven. Chicken has no fridge taste and skin taste not so oily.

Tau gua is also really good

I love their chilli too!"
A hidden gem! This is one of the most delicious chicken rice stall in SG but is so off the beaten path that it's relatively unknown. Their chicken is delicious and the chili goes well with the rice. Their achar is something I always look forward to.
"their pickle is so damn good, really complements the chicken rice. be prepared to have a very long queue and battle for seating as the food court is too small and barely able to accommodate influx costumer"
Amazing value-for-money old school chicken rice. $12 for two person set! Love the generous portion of complementary cabbage soup. Chicken is very juicy soaked in sauce.
It really isn't my cuppa tea. But I hear some people love this.
Not bad. Nice soup too
Super nice.... Serious!! From the rice to the chilli and awesome soup
"Hainanese Chicken Roast and White. When you cannot decide between both the white or roast chicken, you get both! Yes, because both types are equally good here but for me the white edge out better."
"Rice too dry and lack on texture.
Sauce for roasted/steamed chicken rather sweet. Homemade achar fast good n fresh. Quite a strange combination for the soup for chicken rice.""lotus root with peanut"""
One of the best chicken rice I've had! Long queue but definitely worth the wait. Comes with complimentary soup. Love it so much.
Good chicken rice experience for local & tourists.
Very delicious chicken with very cheap price. Unbelievable good.
Shiok good price yummy but be prepared to wait
"Favourite chicken rice place for my family! We prefer this to Tian Tian at Maxwell, albeit different styles. Love the soups, bean sprout and roasted chicken! Highly recommended comfort food!"
What else can I say?
Most popular in Singapore's east ? Or the whole of Singapore!
Was too busy gobbling the food so no photos. Good chicken with tons of vegetables in the soup and a free flow of Ah Char.
"This is one of my favorite chicken rice in Singapore. The chicken is tender, the rice is perfectly cooked, with lots of flavour. I love the peppery soup with the cabbage and shredded chicken. I also ordered the oyster sauce vegetables and the beansprouts."
Value for money ..unlimited pickled veg... great taste...
great chicken. comes with different soup every other day. the soup is very nice.
"Delicious chicken rice, free high quality soup, acha, good chilli and garlic sauce. All at an unbelievable low reasonable price!"
"The wait was super long even at 2:30pm. Like 45 mins. The rice is dry. The white chicken is not tender.
But, the soup and sauces are Delicious. The garlic chips sauce on chicken makes this place decent.
Had high expectations coming from Food King... but would not come to katong for this."
Rice is dry and hard. It tastes like undercooked or lack of water when cooking. Chicken is tender. The sauce is leaning towards sweetness which makes it easy to eat but I don't think that is what the sauce of chicken should taste like. Attitude is bad. Think it is a bit pricey too. They never display price at all. The only bright side is the chilli which is good.
U know tuck kee?
A nice plate of chicken rice but not a wow plate
"Just like how i experienced 5 years ago (was studying in New Zealand). They've upgraded their service system to a queue number, irradicating standing and waiting in long lines. You can grab a seat/order a drink and wait till your number is called. Food is great, the stall uncle is great. I had the roast chicken thigh rice ($5 and very affordable) and man it still tastes amazing."
Best chicken rice in Singapore
Very crowded didnt managed to eat. A mother and daughter diners are unwilling to share a table of four.
Not bad. Really loved their soup LoL even it's about the Chicken rice
One of the best in Singapore n is always long queue. The chicken is succulent n the soup though free is better than many paid ones. Achar is free too.
"Not great chicken and rice, long wait for food"
Good to eat and packet home
My favourite chicken rice
"Taste very so so but soup is extraordinarily nice. But need to wait for 40 minutes for the food, definitely will not come again."
New number queuing system.  Long waiting time.
Free flow of fruit salad
Good chicken rice. But difficult to get a seat and long waiting time for food.
One of the best chicken rice island wide
Delicious food at an amazing price. The crispy garlic flakes were a delightful touch!
Love the rice and the roasted chicken. Long queues so gotta be there early
"Hard-to-find place hidden in the basement of this old building ""Katong Shopping Centre"". Food was reasonably good. Free soup given is not the typical chicken rice soup but one with the goodness of home-cooked love. The free-flow achar is superb. Worth giving this place a try."
Different taste of chicken rice good to have once a life time
"very orderly. 1 to take order, and an uncle that yells/buzz your number.  do try to pay attention when your number is approaching, as they try to clear orders as fast as possible to keep everyone's waiting time to their shortest"
The free soup and free achar... Plus the fried garlic bits... Best chicken rice you'll find in Singapore
"Flies on the acar.. Steamed chicken tasted normal to me. Best thing is the soup and fake abalone in the vegetables. It costed 17 for 2 pax, which is really quite expensive for chicken rice."
Best chicken rice in spore esp the lotus soup
Excellent chicken and good serving of dishes from the food store.
"White chicken rice at $5 per head, come with free lotus peanut soup and achar. Value for money."
Nice chicken rice and the soups
"So far the best and almost perfect chicken rice I ate!

Long queue during lunch crowd with a number system. Even though there are 20 over numbers in front of us but we did not wait too long (i think we waited only for 10mins).

We ordered roasted and steamed chicken drumsticks to compare. It comes with soup and acar complimentary. Both types of chicken are very tender. There are even garlic crisps on the chicken! The braised egg is so fragrant! The chicken rice is also great. We are given 2 soups, cabbage soup and peanut lotus root chicken feet soup. Cabbage soup is too peppery. But the peanut soup is wonderful! Pity the roasted meat skin is not crispy"
"Heard abt tis place so often from my colleagues & being here finally makes me craved for the so much talk abt chicken rice with free flow  achar & cabbage soup. Order the white steam chicken,  it only cost $5! Rice looks yellow but no fragrance of chicken nor oil more like bland yellow rice.  Chicken meat though tender but bland. Lucky there is the soya sauce to lift up the taste.  Achar was good but too sweet with no ground peanuts (foc,  who's to complain?)  However the cabbage soup is good as it was prepared with chicken bones. It value for $ if you r only looking to fill your stomach during lunch."
"Rather ironic that they named their store  'Boneless Chicken Rice' yet they do not actually debone the chicken, would have requested not to have chicken wings if I had known earlier. A unique take of the dish as they drenched the chicken with lots of deep fried dice garlic but doesn't felt it actually elevate the taste of the meat."
Such a long queue so it's not worth it if you order 1 pack of chicken rice because other customers order en masse. At least they allow refunds
1 hour. Thays how long it took to get 2 plates of chicken rice. They have no sense of urgency and take money up front. They make people wait like fools.
"Initially I thought 5.5 SGD for drumstick rice is a little bit expensive. However after I get my dish, I change my mind. You can see not only drumstick and rice but also a cabbage chicken bone soup and a kind of pineapple salad?  I like the Singapore style chicken rice. However rice is usually too oily and sinful. This one with the fragrant rice but not too oily. So amazing. And the chicken with the savory sauce is perfectly matching. Additionally the soup is also a flavorful chicken bone one. Finally, I like the pineapple salad, this is the highlight for the stall. Amazing and well balanced meal."
"One of the best chicken rice I ever had in Singapore! The chicken is so tender and side dish is very delicious too!! The soup and acar that comes together with the meal, totally complimentary. Great value for money!"
"Non-(Delicious Boneless Chicken Rice)

Dissatisfied, confused & hungry. These are the 3 thoughts that shot across my mind after stepping out of the shop.

Chicken. Average at best. Tough, grainy and somehow it doesn't taste ""chicken-y"" enough. Flavors stop at the sauce and its missing from the meat.
Rice was too light and nt lacking in flavours for me. But I can see some may like that its not too rich.
How is this FoodKing good???

The way to sweet achar, was freeflow. The standard cabbage chicken soup was way too peppery too.

But I've to say the chilli and ginger were good. Plus the deep fried garlic sprinkled on top of the chicken.

We left to eat Hokkien Mee after cause it was just too disappointing.

P. S. We reached at 6pm on a Thursday and the queue was 1min long"
"Great value for money! Stall provides free yummy soups (with awesome ingredients inside, not just liquid) and pickled vege. Friendly staff too"
Best chicken rice in Singapore.
"Waited more than an hour for this chicken rice which is nothing much special, rice is hard to chew. Only the peanut chicken feet soup that comes with the chicken rice taste good. Very crowded environment, difficult to find a table and dine properly."
"Think everything is a must try here ! The chicken feet and lotus root soup was amazing with the boneless chicken and rice! Somehow managed to eat a whole chicken plus all the sides for two but post workout lol. Line on a saturday afternoon was about 30-40 mins but in an ac'ed food court, which is nice. Worth a try for sure and enjoy ! The soup though !! Must come back !"
Good stuff. Just that the wait was too long.
"Hidden gem of chicken rice hawkers.
Worth the queue. Be patient and avoid peak hours."
"Better than average, but really nothing special. Chicken was dry and rice was subpar. Please try five star chicken rice nearby or even boon tong kee for better chicken rice."
"Very nice meh? Feel like the people who like it not because of the taste, but for some nostalgia like they had been going there in their adolescences... chicken itself is a bit dry, and have to wait for one hour... definitely not worth a special visit"
No words can describe how delicious this Chicken Rice is. Just come and try for yourself.
"Location: Katong
Atmosphere: Old mall, aircon foodcourt.
Service: Queue to order, pay, queue to collect, eat.
Taste: Overrated, seriously normal, roasted chicken is not deboned despite telling them and signboard is Delicious Boneless Chicken Rice and meat is tough.
Price: Ex compare to normal coffeeshop.
Cons: Free soup, achar
Note: Take a pinch of salt when you read review sites."
It has my favourite food there
Come early if u don't to be stuck in the long queue.. Food is exceptionally delicious!
Great plate of chicken rice
"I was 3rd in line and suddenly one person came to clip a ""40mins"" sign and just walked away without explaining anything.

A patron in front of me asked ""Is there a 40mins wait? For chicken rice??"" And they just nodded and say yes.

What kind of eff up attitude is this? There were a lot of chicken on display and the queue was not that long so we are not sure why the wait time is so long. They could have explained that there is a long wait time due to dine in or takeaway orders... But they just seemed irritated that there's a lot of customers and they wish to chase us away.

Chicken rice have to wait for 40mins?!

Tell that to any Singaporean and they will say you are SIAO.

Seriously. No matter how good the taste is, please have at least have the decency to be cordial to customers who travelled all the way down to patron your store."
"Over rated chicken rice, of course you can find a much better chicken rice elsewhere too. And is quite pricey for a plate of chicken rice."
Nice chicken rice! Pretty long queue though
Love the peppery soup 
"Been eating this since young. It is my favourite chicken rice stall. Everything is nice about the chicken rice here. Chicken is tender, juicy and drizzled with a delicious sauce. Soup is always hearty and boiled with loads of ingredients. Love the free achar with pineapples and cucumbers. Service has gotten better over the years too."
Chicken is succulent and rice is fragrant without being oily. The achar is freshly made and crunchy. Soup is good too though a bit on the salty side
Delicious brewed soup and unlimited achar that comes with the chicken rice 
Nice chicken rice
"Wait too long, not worth to wait."
Best chicken rice in Singapore (in my humble opinion according to some friends)
"The roast chicken is on point. Nicely roasted, meaty and substantial in portion. The soup is also quite tasty and also contains vegetables which differs from most other places serving just flavoured water. They offer free Acar which is a plus point especially for someone who wants a balanced meal. The rice is mediocre, it lacks fragrance and taste. This is easily made up for by the chilli which is really good. It is not too overpowering or too spicy that it kills your taste buds. Rather, it adds just the right amount of flavour and spiciness to complement the rice."
Still one of the best chicken rice!
The pictures say it all. Regular Patron
"Longer waiting time nowadays, pricier, but good."
Ling queue!
"The chicken meat met expectations. The Chicken Rice set came with pickled vegetables and a cabbage soup, which was surprisingly pepperish. Do note that the queue at this place can get quite incredible during peak hours. I was only slightly disappointed with the service as the owner (a young chap) unceremoniously dumped the plate of chicken meat onto the tray I was holding."
"Good taste but high price, whole chicken cost $32."
Best boneless chicken rice in town. Period.
One of the best Chicken Rice!
"They were very generous with the soup and you can help yourself with the pickle. I really like these. The rice and chicken were ok, nothing special."
A bit pricey but comes with free archa. Says boneless but not really boneless. Nice soup.
Great chicken with delicious soup. Free flow Achar vegetable
Great food at reasonable price given the portions - paid $5 for a plate of chicken rice a d additional $1 for added chicken parts
"Ok chicken rice. Rice a tad too hard. Chicken not tender and fragrance enough. Chilli a bit bland. However, the soup is good. Overall taste a bit short of expectation for the long queue reputation."
"Great taste, generous portions. One of the best you can find in Singapore."
Nice but overpriced
generous servings and good service
Nice chicken rice with soup! Love the achar as well
"One of my favorite chicken rice stalls. Chicken is plump and delicious. I enjoy the rice as well.

In addition the free soups they serve are not the usual one from poaching chicken. They serve a lotus root soup and cabbage soup as well. They also serve some pickled vegetables. They are very generous with these so order less than you normally would."
"Favourite chicken rice  with random soup, which is a nice surprise since I will not know what the soup of the day will be."
Chicken rice not the traditional Hainanese style.
Best try their chicken rice store. Always long queue
"Prominently situated at the basement of Katong Shopping Centre, this chicken rice set is popular among those who live near the area and is slightly costlier than your average dish. You may also request for the boneless option upon your order. At a plate of $5, the set comes with free flow achar and soup with plenty of ingredients.

Be prepared to wait a maximum of 20 minutes for your order to be ready for collection. Rice was slightly yellow and flavorful. Both the steamed and roasted chicken breast were tender; its accompanying sauce was fragrant, flavorful albeit slightly salty for my liking. The steamed chicken, however, was not , deboned properly as there are chunks of bones found on some parts of the meat.

The achar (pickled vegetables) served tasted way too sweet and syrupy for my liking. Its flavor was too one dimensional- more on the sweet side, instead of a balance/ combination of sweet, spicy and sour flavors, which an ideal achar should taste like. A generous big bowl of soup was given, with plentiful cabbage and some carrot pieces.  Unfortunately, all I could taste was strong pepper undertones, devoid of the natural sweetness from the boiled vegetables and chicken parts.

Props to the chili sauce as it was thick and viscous. It tasted strongly of fragrant garlic and had a sour limey after taste, which makes a good accompaniment to the chicken."
"The chicken rice served is worth the hype, and extremely flavourful. Chicken is served deboned, albeit not thoroughly, hence convenient to eat and safe for children.

The waiting time for lunch here was found to be about 18 minutes for a meal for two, but the flavours was well worth the wait. Breast meat served was not dried out, and the sauce it sits in augments the flavour. Adding this sauce to the rice makes for a pallet titillating plate of rice, although the sauce may also be too salty for some.

Pickled salad, achar, was served free flow, but is sweet, hence may not be to the liking of many people. Soup was served in a large bowl, but only shallow spoons were provided to drink the thin soup with. The soup was also primarily peppery, masking any original chicken flavour that it should be boasting of.

Portion was average, but is slightly more expensive than usual at SGD 5 per set. Provided chicken rice chilli is not free available, but scores well for what it is.

Overall, this chicken rice place serves good food, recommended for tourists and locals alike. Albeit tucked away in an obscure shopping centre and requires some patience after you place your order."
Nice chicken rice with achar n tasty soup refillable
"Worth the wait as it comes with free soup(s) & achar.
Rice is not oily, that's good. Chilli and ginger condiments are just right. Bai Chicken is tender, not salty too.

Their upsell of eggs, tofu, liver, gizzards, vegetables etc, I have yet to try.
These add on means you need to find a bigger table and wallet 2."
Generous serving of side dish and soup.
"Very affordable chicken rice meal with excellent service. The chicken rice itself is comforting and nice, but what makes the experience memorable is the soup and acar that comes together with the meal, totally complimentary. Service is great as well, they help you arrange your tray so that you can carry it easily to your table. Very considerate and friendly.
Was here on a Sunday evening and there was still a healthy queue before they closed at 8pm."
"Best value chicken rice is katong! Each order coming with free achar, cabbage soup and chicken feet soup! Super long queue but your patience will be amply rewarded!"
It's OK. Average taste and texture for the boneless chicken. Comes with free soup (peppery taste) and fruit salad. I like the fruit salad. There was a short queue at dinner time and is the most popular stall at the food court.
"Good for their steamed and roasted chicken. Comes with ""free"" soup and Ahzar"
Slight overpriced and over rated chicken rice which tasted kinda average. The achar was nice a nice apetitizer with its sweet sour tanginess. Didn't get to taste the soup since I tapau. The portion of rice is smaller if you take away.
"It's a pretty decent Chicken Rice, as in the Rice. It have its unique flavour. But nothing really wow. The chicken is average. Price is $5 for a plate, that is pretty expensive base on its quality. I could say it's overrated."
Queue was building before 11 am. while other stalls were swatting flies. Nice chilli and ginger condiments to go with the tender chicken.
The Boneless Chicken Rice was delicious. The servings were also generous and the complimentary soup is also yummy. Can't wait to have it again.
"Not too bad, long queue though"
Best chicken rice for those who love sweeter sauce. But be prepared to queue for seats and food during peak hours.
Solid chicken rice! Best in my opinion.
Chicken is good and the soup is great. Very generous with the ingredients in the soup and side dishes.
One of the best out there.  Really good soup as well.
"Possibly one of the best chicken rice in Singapore. Not the cheapest, but hey, what you pay is what you get."
"delicious, clean, good price"
Big serving and nice soup
"One of the best chicken rice in Singapore and it's not even a hidden gem as there will be a queue. But the queue is not super long that it will deter people from going. Where to start? The rice is fragrant and 'lemak' enough, the chicken is tender and sauce is slightly sweet, which really compliments the dish. The chili garlic sauce is also just right, not too sour or spicy. The bonus point is the chicken vegetable soup, which you can refill! I have previously tried their BBQ and roasted pork and they tasted good as well!"
Cheap and good. Hygiene is good
"Long queue during peak hours, but quality always good. Price is higher than usual Hawker stall, but comes with free delicious soup, like pork ribs lotus root soup..."
Bit of a wait during lunch hour but well worth it.
"Mei Ci Lai Xin Jia Po Yi Ding Hui Lai Chi De Ji Fan,Ping Shi Jia Ge,Zhen Cai Shi Liao,You You Mian Fei Pao Cai He Mei Ri Li Tang,Yi Fen 5Yuan Xin Bi. Xin Jia Po Hen Nan Zhao Dao CPZhi Zhe Mo Gao De Can Dian Liao!"
Nice n friendly staffs
Best chicken rice in the east <3
"very good food, must try...."
Chicken portion is huge and the food is good. Will recommend to people staying in the area. Not sure if a lot of MSG was used as we felt pretty thirsty afterwards. The place is quite cram though.
Food is ok just that the queue is very long
Was there at around 3-4pm when it wasn't crowded but there was still a short queue. Definitely one of the better chicken rice in Singapore. A colleague from Hong Kong loved it too.
My favourite chicken rice in Singapore !! Must try !
Stall with digital queue nos.. crowded during lunch.
"One of the hidden gems for chicken rice in Singapore. If you come at lunch time, be prepared to line up and look for seats."
"Did you know that for a plate of chicken rice, you get a bowl of delicious chicken & cabbage soup & free flow of archar. The chicken is tender and boneless. However, I must give only 2 star for the rice. The quality of the rice is below standard I feel. Nevertheless, it's still a good place to have chicken rice."
"Get the steamed chicken rice instead of the roasted one. It's where they shine. Comes in a set with a really delicious soup and a side of achar(pickles with pineapple). Make sure to get the garlic, chilli and soy sauce to mix and match!"
Very nice chicken rice
"This is like a coffeeshop mink food court in the basement of the mall. They have other food there too, SUPER CROWDED. The Boneless Chicken Rice is very popular and the queue is longggg. Food is alright.. Was it worth the wait? - well if u ask me, I'd say no. But that would be really subjective. What I love, was the SOUP - and you can get a complimentary top up as well which is GREAT!"
The soup is the best part of this meal. Comes free with a meal of chicken rice.
Long queue on a Saturday. Managed to get my chicken rice in a dabao form in case I didn't get any seats. Had this chicken rice since 2001 ?
$5 chicken rice + $5 chicken feet = $10 epic meal time.
Mao Gu Wen Hao Chi. 
sambal packs a punch!
"Delicious. But in the weekends it gets really crowded and expect a 20 min wait.enjoy free soup which is very tasty.free refills too.

But their chasiew is very hard.. so just have the chicken rice and chicken."
The ah char is damn crunchy and nicely season. The rice is average. The price for all these food is worth it.
Service is quite alright despite the crowd. Their rice is fragrant and not too oily like some stores. Both steamed and roasted chicken were tender and well-seasoned. Overall quite pleased. My group thoroughly enjoyed the free flow of boiled soup too.
Really good chicken rice and their soups are superb!
"Not exactly boneless but the chicken is roasted evenly without much fats underneath the skin. Pair it with chilli and Ah Za. Interesting combination of sweet and sour with savoury taste of chicken. Soup included too!

Generous portion too!"
Seriously the best chicken rice in Singapore. Generous with their soup. Worth queuing for!
Tasty. Free soup and pickled vegetables (achar)
Crowded and the chicken rice is acceptable
Probably the best chicken rice in the world
Oldie but a goodie.
"Excellent chicken rice stall, meat and rice are standard fare (plus point for having boneless option), soup is amazing (solid chicken bones and ingredients, plus you always get served with a big bowl of it), free flow achar sides is a crowd puller, and yes, the chili is really good! And did I say, it's not expensive at all. For the price of it, this is super value for money"
Love their Thai fried chicken rice
Great food...hidden gem. Value for money for such portion!
"Chicken breast was tender and flavorful, but the texture of the skin wasn't as jelly as some of my favorite chicken rice stalls. The achar was a nice touch, and the chicken rice soup is one of the best ones around. It's free, but I would have paid for it. Chock full of flavor, it was a rich meat/veggie broth with lots of meat flakes and veggies. Better than most soups you'd get from a hawker soup/rice stall.Tau kwa was soft and braised well."
"One of the best chicken rice I ever had, taste so much better then some of the famous shop. The chicken is so tender, also the soup, side dish is very delicious!! Suggest to go there as soon as they open, especially on weekend... otherwise will have to wait for a long time."
Not exactly boneless.
Good chicken and good portion of food 
Good value for money. The free soup is a bit like what mom used to make. And free flow of achar!
Not enough seats
Absolutely delicious chicken rice. Love the achar and daily soup that are complimentary when you dine there. Must try!
BBQ meat is very dry.
"Simply love the achar, chilli sauce, soup, vegetables and definitely the roast chicken. Must try whenever you visit. Queue expected, be patient cos turnover pretty fast."
"The rice was too dry and no fragrance of chicken. The portion was quite big and costs only $5. The chicken was average I would say, but I like the soup though, it's really nice!  I had been waiting for about an hour to get my food, the queqe and waiting hour were insane!"
"Standard fluctuates, soup menu changes everyday and very delicious."
"Unpretentious hearty serving of chicken rice in food court. Each serving comes with appetising achar (pickled mix of cucumber, carrots, onions and pineapples), wholesome clear soup and your plate of chicken rice."
Delicious Boneless Chicken Rice serves Delicious Boneless Chicken Rice that is not only Delicious but Boneless.. Chicken.. Rice..
Chicken rice was above average in taste. Probably one of the better ones in East but cant say for elsewhere in Singapore.
"Love the Ajar, the soup of the day, steam or roasted chicken and the chicken feets. Yummy"
"Value for money. About 6+ dollars per person which includes a big bowl of soup and also generous cuts of chicken. Free flow achar is provided. One of the better chicken rice around too (love the fried garlic they put on the chicken and also the sauce that goes with the chicken).

Really long waiting times during weekday evenings and weekends though."
"Best chicken rice of the East, maybe even all Singapore."
Local food. Worth to try.
"The chicken rice and the steam chicken only average. The rice is a little yellowish but unfortunately has got no chicken fragrance and very dry. The steam chicken is tender but No taste at all.
I think the crowd draw is the free flow of archar and chicken soup"
Literally delicious!
"Fragrant rice, well seasoned chicken and awesome soup! Highly recommend"
"The boneless chicken drumstick is tender n juicy. A set comes with chicken, rice Archar n a snail bowl of cabbage hot soup. It's value for money $5.50 per set."
Ordered half a chicken + one plate of vege + 3 rice. Cost $28 but the portion is huge! The soup that came along with it is super delicious too!!! We went around 730pm close to their closing time so didnt have to wait very long. Still there were about 10 ppl before us. Worth it!
Every dish is delicious
Good value for money
The queue is insane but it's amazing after all these years. They even give out free soup that ranges from pepper pig stomach soup to cabbage hearty ones. And MOST of the pieces are boneless. What a champion chicken rice shop that does all the work for you
"A true gem hidden at the basement of Katong Shopping centre. Prepared to wait up for more than 30mins and longer for lunch time. Went there on a Sunday afternoon and waited close 25mins. All I can say, the wait is worth it. Rice is really fragent and chicken has a good texture to it. The rice came with a dish of Pickled veg more commonly known as Achar. highly recommended if you are a chicken rice lover!"
"What rubbish boneless chicken rice as stated. order via food panda , thigh chicken full of bones n small bits that is not remove at all. Never had such a bad chicken rice taste in my life. any hawker chicken stall will taste much better than them. i will ban them forever."
very famous for their chicken rice
"Quite decent chicken rice at one of the most unlikely locations - basement of one of the oldest shopping centers in Singapore. Amidst a clutter of maid agencies and random shops, this chicken rice stall has come a long way.

was shocked at the price but realized there is a good bowl of soup that accompanies the rice and with generous portions of preserved spicy veg - ah zhar.

Well worth a try if you are in the vicinity."
One of the most generous chicken rice stall in Singapore. Delicious boneless chicken served! Ordered half chicken and uncle give a boiled soup w pork and intestines.. Also a plate of Achar w pineapple and onions.. The rice is fragrant and the half chicken is huge.. It only cost $19... Really 5/5 and certainly will return to eat again!
"Delicious! Great chicken rice, great sides very affordable"
The chicken rice here is really good
"Easily the top 5 steam hainanese chicken rice in singapore by most reviewers. They are famous for their steamed chicken, so if u are only i to roast chicken, dun bother coming. The rice is pretty average though

Gives you a generous bowl of soup and pickled veggie to go with your meal. The soup is cooked with lots of chicken bones and so its very flavourful, unlike thos MSG solution you usually get at other chicken rice store.

Do try out their de-boned chicken feet."
One of the best
"Breast part overcook.. slightly tough. Why the rice is yellow in colour. No fragrance, taste like white rice . Achar is ok . Soup abit Abit peppery (ok).  First try"
One of the best chicken rice places in town.
"The best chicken rice i've had. Including the soup, the sides, superb! But you'll have to queue quite long. But its worth the wait! Well, you always have to learn how to wait to get the best things in life right?"
One of the best chicken rice in Singapore
"One of the better chicken rice places around - comes with soup with vegetables and achar. Tip: if you aren't too hungry, share a set with someone, just order an additional plate of rice and a bigger meat portion."
The soup is fantastic there.
"Amazing flavour, good portions, service was good considering that it's a hawker stall. The price is higher for a hawker stall but the portions and the soup (with real flavour and filling, not the clear type) is so worth it! Queue can be long, so expect a half hour wait on average."
"Tender chicken, fragrant rice. Loved the cabbage soup and the chunky achar!"
"Wow, wow I thought I knew chicken rice. This place may not be as well known as its bigger chain counterparts, but the flavors here are way bigger! It's not crowded and it's priced reasonably.. so quite honestly this has redefined chicken rice for me. If one had to nick pick, the chicken they use here are smaller so the bites are less chunky. But the textures are absolutely sublime and the flavors more than make up for it... so much fragrance and umami. In short, eat here if you really really know chicken rice (and before the mall disappears for good)."
"Nice soup & achar (help yourself to one serving)....delicious sauce and chilli....with ""yellow"" chicken rice..."
"Top quality hawker meal that simply is emblematic of why the best food in Singapore are made by our industrious hawkers. Apart from the juciy steamed/roasted chicken, they offer amazing side dishes as well as FREE (yes, no extra charge) soups to go with the fragrant chicken rice. And all so affordable."
Cheap and good food in an air-conditioned kopitiam. Doesn't get any better than this.
"When you want best value for money in chicken rice. U get chicken, rice, local salad (achar) and soup better than some places serving soup as a main course."
"always have long snaking queue. Often sold out after 5pm, but its easy to know why. The chicken meat is tasty and tender. Rice cooked to perfection. and some more give hot chicken with vegetable soup and achar. LIFE IS GOOD when eating their food."
"Chicken is not bad, rice so so, chilli not bad...

But when you put the whole meal together and consider the price you are paying, I don't think you can get this experience elsewhere.

They throw in this free, huge bowl of tasty winter melon sweet corn pork rib soup (I'm very particular with soup and I actually like this), free flow achar and suddenly this chicken rice looks like a home cooked, five courses meal! Especially so when I added roast pork and chicken liver.

Highly recommended!"
Rice feels dry. Chicken is OK. Price is more and more expensive. Attitude is black face. Standard dropped liao.
Food is exceptionally good. A unique chicken rice experience.
"Good value, especially the chick"
Chicken meat is juicy and tender
Better than the Michelin starred chicken rice.
"Deliciously good n tender chicken meat.
Free pickles salad n soup too
Will return with friends. Keep the trade going  strong"
Best chicken rice in Singapore!!
Best chicken rice in SG complete meal with chicken soup and vegetables
Chicken comes with bones despite shop name.
"My favourite chicken rice ever! Love the yellow rice and crispy garlic. Simple, decadent and authentic!"
"The chicken was juicy. The crystal chicken feet skin was very succulent texture with a hint of chewiness similar to jellyfish. The chili and ginger sauce was very generous in its taste of fresh produce used to make it. A worthwhile meal, great but not excellent."
"My favorite chicken rice place bar none. Fantastic value as they add on soups for free with your order if you order half or a whole chicken. Free flow a-char is also appreciated. Only downside is the venue, but I personally find the old aesthetic and feel quite endearing."
Best chicken rice with generous serving of daily brewed soup!
Good quality and serves big portion of soup(yummy) which is my favourite. Not too ex and yet value for money .. avoid lunch time or go earlier. Limited seats and prepare to queue.
"Di Dian Hen Yin Mi Dan Zhe Jia Ji Fan Zhen De Hen Hao Chi,Zui Xi Huan Ji Rou Da Pei De Jiang Liao Gen Hen Kai Wei De Xiao Cai Acar. Fen Liang Bu Xiao Suo Yi Chi De Hen Man Zu!"
Nice and delicious
"This is my 2nd time here. Very nice steamed chicken, tender and juicy. Normally I dont like the breast part, but they make it very delicious. The food goes well with peanut lotus soup and oyster sauce vegetable. The food portion is right and the price is reasonable. Definitely reccomended!"
Besto place for chicken rice.
The soup and achar is awesome
Value for money! Big portion as always with soup with substance and archa!
"Long queue, but worth the wait. Generous portions and delicious chicken"
"Definitely 1 of the best..
My favourite stall for chicken rice..
Will take photos next time"
My favourite till today.
"One of the better chicken rice around. The chicken rice itself may not be the best taste in Singapore. But, it comes with lotus or cabbage soup and Ah Zha which make the whole meal worth for the price they command. Go try."
"One of the best in Singapore and for good reason. Good serving size, you get plenty of ingredients in their soups (w/ free refills) and even free flow achar as well! 1 star lost as their rice isn't as nice as some places..."
"One of the best in the Geylang area. Great ""White Chicken"" rice with free soup and side dish make me visit them again even though the routing may ruin my whole day plan. The neighbour shops like Laksa and Kopi are also great."
"Have been visting them for the past 20 years. In my opinion, best chicken rice in Singapore. Their soup is so good and it comes with the set. This stall is a must try."
It was really delicious!
Great chicken rice
"Heard a lot about the famous chicken rice at Katong Shopping Centre. Came on Wednesday afternoon at 4pm. The place wasn't packed and there was no queue at this time.
The stall looks tidy and clean.

- Ordered one pack of roasted chicken with extra rice, price @ $6.
- Good portion for 2 to share...
- Chicken tasted very tender and fresh
- Rice was very fragrance
- Nicely presented and appealing
- Didn't manage to try their soup...

- Easy to find parking lots at Tanjong Katong Shopping Centre.

Definitely one of the TOP chicken rice in the eastern part of Singapore.

"
"Chicken, soup, achar all good. However, I feel that the rice is not fragrant enough."
Was pretty amazing
"Came here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch and it was really crowded. The Queue was about 20 minutes wait but it is well worth it! The chicken rice was well cooked and they are generous in their garnishes and soups.

They didn't give typical soups but boiled soups with lots of ingredients! Will come here again."
"Only positive experiences.
Free flow peanut or cabbage soup and pickled vegetables
Visit bimonthly."
The queue can be rather long
"Literally the best chicken and rice joint I have tried in Singapore. Get there during a quit time or near the long, long line. The gravy they use for the chicken is amazing!"
"queue is longer than ever, and the peanut soup is no longer complimentary, $5 charge. how ever the chicken rice is as delicious as ever"
You Mian Fei De Tang He Lei Si Pao Cai De Xiao Cai!Ji De Wei Dao Ye Bu Cuo!Zhi Shi Huan Jing Pu Tong
Chicken is moist and tender. Soup and pickles which comes free as part of every order are perfect complements. Rice is ok only but for $5 it's a solid 4.5 stars
Over priced and Bad service
Food good but expensive
Great Chicken rice.
Great portions. Queues may be long at times. One of the best chicken rices around. Comes with hearty generous soups. Abit pricey but worth it
Good and affordable
The best chicken rice in Singapore.
One of the better chicken rice in singapore
Great tasting chicken rice with Achar and wonderful lotus pork rib soup. One of the best Chicken rice in Singapore. Great value there! No wonder there was a long queue when we arrived there during lunchtime.
"Like the chicken feet, achar and the soup."
"As Michelin Star location for hawker foods, this is a definite recommended stall to visit. Chicken Rice is excellently made and very fresh, and is a great crowd pleaser. The soup is also another tasty item on the menu.

However, with how well established this store is, the lines to queue are usually long at meal times. But that's a good sign."
If you have seen how the food handler handle the chicken in the back kitchen you will not want to eat it anymore .
Very nice but a bit pricey for a hawker type of chicken rice
"Very nice chicken rice, but queue builds up at about 11.20. Food very good and consistent."
"There is no ambience to speak off. However, the cleaners do a decent job. Can be crowded around meal times. Aside from the chicken rice stall, there is a braised duck stall to recommend. Most patrons order chicken rice. The duck stall is to my mind underrated as its offering is excellent. Other stalls are the usual. You can also dine al fresco at neighboring outlets in the center."
Reasonable prices and good food
"White chicken and crystal chicken feet was so good! Service is great too!
Total cost was $20 for 2 person cos we added on gizzards and crystal chicken feet. But it was a sumptuous meal cos we were given free soup + acar. Uncle was meticulous enough to remember that I don't want peanuts in my dishes.
Queue is about 30 mins during lunch time on weekend.."
The best chicken rice in SG. Hands-down. And the only chicken rice stall that I know of that provides free-flow of achar and soup i.e. lotus soup with generous serving of ingredients like pork rib. Many thumbs up!!!
"Strangely, the chicken served to me was cold. Though the taste of the rice and the chicken gets a thumbs up. Served with a generous amount of soup and veggie, it all costed me $10."
Been 20yrs eating this still taste good. And free flow of soup!
"One of the best chicken rice you can find
...their soup is really good..."
"Be prepared to queue, 20-30mins during weekend peak meal hours. It's at air conditioned environment, makes queuing bearable. Chicken meat is soft and tender. Rice not oily and not much chicken taste, healthy choice? Surprise are the free soups and arhcar. Soup are favourful and full of vegetables or peanuts. Chilli sauce is a little sour. Archar is refreshing light and fresh, balancing the meal. Good chicken rice stall, worth spending time to queue."
Best I boneless chicken and rice I have ever had! And all this for $5 SGD!!!
Gud fud and free achar
Best chicken rice in the East
"I love their chicken rice, cooked to perferction, tender conbined with the right souce and spice..hhhmmmm.  price id reasonable.."
Very good but always busy. They have a.c.
"Chicken is juicy and succulent! The rice is so flavourful, free soup and archar, worth every penny."
Delicious really means delicious
"Chicken is not tender,  dry rice not fragrant enough, chili not spicy enough. chicken drum, wings, roast pork and soup cost me $11.00 which is extremely expensive."
"One of the better indie establishments in the Katong area, if not Singapore. Their chicken is tender and juicy which perfectly complements the fragrant rice. Top it off with a bowl of piping hot chicken soup, definitely a feast for the soul. Try their chicken feet skin in sweet sauce too."
Top 5 chicken rice in Singapore for sure
Its pricey. Rice is hard and dry. Used to be pretty nice but not sure why the quality has dropped.
Awesome chicken rice! Be prepared to queue at least 20min tho.
"Chicken was not worth the 20min wait. The achar, and soup turned out to be better than the chicken itself. A portion for twin sharing adds up to $12, so not exactly cheap for coffee shop standard? Would recommend others over this."
Free Soup / Picket with Chicken Rice order (1) at $4.80
"Food: 9/10
Cost: $
Recommended food: Chicken rice and soup selection

This place offers the best overall experience of having chicken rice in Singapore. Nice and tender chicken with fragrant rice. Generous serving of soup and Achar to complement your chicken rice. Highly recommended, my favorite place for a wholly chicken rice dining experience."
BEST CHICKEN RICE IN SINGAPORE
Such a satisfying meal. We ordered the chicken rice set to share and it came with 2 big bowls of soup and free flow achar for just $17! It's more than enough for 3 pax (unless you're famished of course).
Great food and value for money
Taste is nice. Soup is good. Price point not that expensive.
Quite pricey. Food is good. You have to tell them if you want boneless chicken otherwise you get all the bones al together.
"One of the best Chicken Rice in Singapore.

I think the key is actually the chicken and the achar. The rice is average at best.

Service is efficient. Staff are friendly and happy. Food is great!

Must visit before Katong Shopping Centre closes forever!"
Good & nice but expensive (5 persons for $57).
First time trying the chicken rice. Texture and taste is just right. Rice and soup is nice also. Loved the free flow archar... But the price kinda too steep.
I love everything here!!! Must is chicken rice! Soup! Archar (salad)! Aaaaand boneless chicken feet!!!
"As the name suggests, it's delicious."
Really good quality of food and free soup which make us return so frequently !
"One of the best chicken rice in Singapore.   Meats r tender,  rice is fragrant without being too oily.  Their complimentary pickled vegi r fresh n nice. The rice come with a big bowl of tasty soup.  Long q during rush hrs."
"Best in singapore. Comes with delicious soup of the day and archar(Chinese salad). Soup is refillable. Rice is fragrant with abundant garlic aroma and isn't oily at all like most other chicken rice stalls, even those supposedly famous chicken rice stalls elsewhere."
"Best chicken rice ever. Service is extremely speedy even though the line at lunch time can get very long. Make sure you know what you want when you step up to order as the people taking orders are efficient and can get impatient.
The rice is fragrant and grainy, the white chicken is perfectly juicy and plump. They serve a bowl of hearty soup as well as provide unlimited pickled vegetables that you can scoop yourself.
The price is on the high side for chicken rice, but it is worth it."
One of my fav chicken rice stall
"Hidden in the basement of an old shopping mall, this chicken rice stall is a hidden gem. The rice is fragrant and savoury, the chicken, especially the roast chicken, is soft and juicy. Definitely coming here often. Go at off hours, sometimes the lines are long."
It's NOT Boneless anymore.
"Delicious Boneless Chicken Rice stall lives up to it's name, delivering delicious chicken rice that delights the heart. Pocket friendly meals that fills the tummy, Delicious Boneless Chicken Rice stall is humbly located within the food court in the basement of Katong Shopping Centre. It's steam chicken is succulent, smooth and silky; whilst it's roast chicken is tender. Service rendered by the stall attendants was excellent. Complimentary achaar was given, along side two bowls of soup of different flavours (Lotus, peanut, chicken feet soup; and chicken, carrot, cabbage soup). Definitely worth well a visit!"
"Good chicken, rice was a little bland"
one of my favourite places for chicken rice!
"Been eating here for over 20 years and the quality has not diminished over time. Hainanese chicken rice is a standard Singaporean staple. Don't think we can live without it! True, blue Singaporeans only eat steam chicken, so go for that. Rice is fragrant and the chili makes all the difference. The best part? The free soup that comes with every order. This is not one of those watery stuff with just some spring onions sprinkled on top. This is the kind that mum makes at home that is full of ingredients and richness. Be prepared for long queues now that the word is out."
"i've had 5 star chicken, boon tong kee, and tian tian chicken rice. this one's my personal fav because the quality and quantity are unbeatable for the price point. they nailed the chicken, the veg, and the soup. and i know the free flow achar is not the star of the show, but i like buying a box home after each meal because it's the best achar i know. the cucumber, chili, pineapple are pickled but so fresh and so juicy and crisp. the pineapple is so sweet."
Don't understand the long queue here during meal times. Above average chicken rice. Its rice could be better. Free flow of vegetable and pork ribs soup and achar.  Perhaps that is their draw?
Initially i thought paying 5 for chicken rice is expensive  but you can get free flow achar fresh n lovely chunky. Big portion of chicken rice. Soup. If you are in the katong area. This is a good chicken rice.
"Please don't demolish Katong Shopping Centre. I beg of you. This is the only reason why I go to Katong Shopping Centre. Perfectly steamed white chicken, perfectly mixed chilli sauce, perfectly made rice. The guys who run the stall usually give a generous serving of soup when you get half a chicken. Gizzards available too! The definition of shiok"
Delicious local food verry cheap. You have to taste the chicken rice absolutly
Best chicken rice in town
"Personally not a fan of chicken rice but decided to try this out seeing the long queue, being at Katong Shopping Centre to get my hands on the scrumptious banana pies at neighboring store Dona Manis.

Steamed chicken was tender, roast chicken comparatively dry and roast pork delicious with melt-in-your-mouth fatty bits with crackling skin. Yellow chicken rice was flavourful yet lacked a robust chicken fragrance.

I adored the accompanying lotus root with peanut and pork rib soup, which was generous with ingredients and peanuts cooked to perfection. The achar provided was also an unexpectedly complementary addition to the meal.

Paid $22 for 2 pax for the dishes (in photo) along with salted fish bean sprouts. A tad expensive and surprisingly humongous portion for a party of 2."
"Delicious steam chicken - cold, boneless and a bit sweet"
9 out of 10 people can be seen eating Chicken Rice
Queue was quite long when we went there during lunch hours. Chicken was delicious and the rice was yellow in colour which is different from other types of chicken rice. There is also free flow of salad at the corner which you can take.
Simply one of the best chicken rice in singapore. Different combo with various ingredients available. Just follow the queue.
"Totally recommend this stall. Affordable pricing, generous portion, prompt staff and mouth watering roasted meat."
"Don't forget to ask for the achar, which is the highlight."
I've been visiting here for years now and I enjoy ordering the half chicken. They will add on a big bowl of soup-of-the-day. The chicken feet is good too.
"Chicken Rice for the soul. Free flow achar, generous chops of tender chicken and properly boiled soup ((lotus root, peanut and pork ribs soup) that allows refilling, this is one chicken rice stall that gives bang for your buck."
Hit and miss. I have been eating here for a few years and I have had my best chicken rice experiences here as well as some not so great experiences. Sometimes the chicken can be quite dry and lack flavour. The soup is great though!
Excellent chicken rice. Love the free refillable soup and achar!
Best chicken rice in town!
"We thoroughly enjoyed the old cucumber soup! The chicken however was average, the rice was dry and not flavourful enough."
"My favourite chicken rice stall. Endless supply of achar, tender moist steamed chicken, full flavoured rice and hearty soup. Best of all, it's not very expensive."
Fantastic chicken rice. Avoid lunch dinner hours.  Very crowded
One of the most delicious chicken rice you could find. Definitely must try!
Nothing special. Achar [Noyonra dish] and soup is free flow.
"The soup, pickles, chicken, and rice were all excellent."
"Everything is excellent. Large servings of quality soup, the fried garlic topping, and the delicious chicken feet."
"Long queue during lunchtime, good chicken and great complimentary side dishes (achar and soup) but so so rice. If you crave chicken rice, this is one of four along this stretch of road, the others are food court at katong i12, boon tong kee and five stars chicken rice along upper east coast road further down the road."
"For me, the main draw is their complimentary soup, the ginger, chili and dark soy sauce condiments. Chicken is quite good too, probably if only their rice is their only blemish (as with most Singaporeans, we've expectations for our chicken rice).

Oh yes, they also serve complimentary achar (local pickled vegetables) that's well received too to whet your appetite!"
Ump! Do Not miss it when you are in the area.
The soup that comes with meal has lots of ingredients
It's impossible to get chicken rice at 10:00 am as per their business hours mentioned here. You'd better be there from 11:00 am instead.
Damn this place has the best chicken rice I ever ate
"Best chicken rice in Singapore, period."
"Free flow of soup, salad, nice chicken"
Super awesome chicken rice. Comes with great soup. It's just the best. Don't forget the complimentary achar.
Probably one of the best chicken rice I have tasted in Singapore. Good archar and soup too. Long queue at peak hour but moving fast
"Big & reasonable portions, including the Daily soup for free unlimited refills! Yummy!"
Nice chicken rice but price seems to be constantly rising
Delicious fresh chicken. Tasty rice. Refreshing achar. Nourishing soup. Super long queue but moves quickly
"No frills, with many options. If you're in the area, just go there n try"
Been going there for years. Their soya milk and bran curd is almost like a major food group for me!
Wonderful drinks.

Food very nice up to 5 star standard!
"Located at a coffee shop near woodgrove mall , I would always visit this place when I visit woodgrove mall. The staff here are amazing and patient such that they even told me the recommendations. The portions here a insanely large for the reasonable price and the food is also very tasty and delicious. Anyone who is in this vicinity can come here and try this amazing food that everyone deserves to try. All in all , this place is amazing from the location the staff the food and even the prices."
"Decided to try something new today, and was pleasantly surprised by huge portions & tender meats.

The chicken chop & pork chop were amazing! 10/10 would recommend.

Will try their steak next round :)"
"Order the pork collar chop with rice(Recommended by shop)

the black pepper sauce is hot with abit sweet taste to it..not sure if it was due to me order sweet corn with it.

Protein portion size are quite generous.. rice egg and corn quite standard  ..

Alot combination to try with also egg crepes.. alot choice around here so give it a try.. know the shop from tiktok...

Lao Ban niang friendly and nice"
Food is good very similar to what we had during my stay in Taiwan. If only they had some cold dessert will be perfect.
"Visited the establishment more then once. This is the most successful one and consider unique flavour dish in SG. Don compare it to western (despite it look similar).

Ordering and servicing via the counter were clear and fast to receive. Menu are still clear as well as its new addition and add on which will make you order without considering if you can finish them .

Food item were prepared and ready within 20 mins with sizzling hot-plate with the orders. Portions were considerable huge to other local or new western food outlet with about same price tag. For a big-eater like me. I do have to limit what I am swallowing due to the amount  pork chop are well done but not too dry, chicken chop were tender and juicy as well. Side dishes either corn or beansprout offer were pan fry with a little cha which gives it the bbq taste alike. Awesome sauce ( we choose the mix sauce) with a best of pepper and maybe Mush?

Sides order the popcorn chicken (salt and pepper seasoning) portions were quite acceptable as compare to shilin or taimei but in small bite version.

This remind us of taichung restaurant Chi Gui Niu Pai that offers similar taste and items.

 must visit."
"Hungry??Want the best and not paying more? Then you must not miss this place. The pictures shown complete nutrient you need;not too salty n not oily. Feels so satisfying after the last drop of it.
Pretty Lady boss cares how you like their cooking . She will come by and say hello. Welcome card given to encourage you to come for more..
Great food, great service..."
Overall the experience is pretty okay cause it is at a coffee shop. Saw it on Instagram and went for it. Ordered 2 of the expensive dish from the menu (Salmon and Ribeye). Salmon is tender and ribeye is ok as the price is affordable. If you are staying around Marsiling to admiralty you can come down and try it yourself 
"Was nearby and wanted to grab a quick lunch and realised this stall is here! really surprised with the massive portion, and the tender chicken. Dabaoed the Dan Bing for my friend and she said it's good too :) would definitely drop by again if I'm around the corner"
chicken chop very nice
"This is one of the rare times viral food lives up to expectations. I came by on a Saturday late afternoon. This stall is located in a quaint kopitiam, and despite the odd hours, customers were trickling in. I was initially undecided between the chicken and pork chop but eventually chose the chicken, as the visual presentation of the chicken chop plate a patron was collecting looked so appealing. I went with noodles, mixed sauce, and added corn, and the total came up to $9.50 (they accept CDC vouchers).

I was given a buzzer as the food is made to order. It took around 10 minutes, and it was definitely worth it. At this price point, I don't expect fresh chicken to be used. Frozen chicken can taste great too, when done right. Indeed, I got a generous slab of tender thigh meat, perfectly charred. I really appreciate the use of light marinade as it goes well with the rest of the sides without feeling overwhelmingly salty. The noodles and tau geh were perfect combos to go along. And the signature chunky sauce? It was in a league of its own.

My only complaint was the serving plate is too small and some of the corn topping fell out as I was trying to  scoop the noodles. Heart pain sia haha.

Despite the somewhat remote location, I will definitely come back for the pork chop and perhaps try their sides."
"Tender chicken chop that is well marinated. The black pepper and mushroom sauce brings it to the next level. Really highest level of chicken chop I had taken. Spaghetti is also very good with sauce. Will bring my boy back to try again. Friendly service.came past 2pm no much queue.perfect.genuinely feel it's good,no perks given for this review.tried the egg crepe too.solid with the sweet sauce."
Very nice food and very friendly service. Thank you so much. Free dessert. Collect a few stamps and get free sides or food. Too bad I don't stay in woodlands. Otherwise I'll go there every day!
"Have been wanting to swing by this eatery since they opened, but they are nestled in a very quiet corner of Singapore and it is a 20 mins drive for me. Not that far but the glaring sun these days makes it extremely tiring. Nevertheless, there is a lot on offer at this eatery which made the traveling so much bearable. My friend and I ordered teppanyaki with spaghetti, I had beef. He had salmon.

Serving was very hearty and the taste was pretty authentic. Took the mixture of mushroom and black pepper at the recommendation of the staff. I think I probably would go for full black pepper. Would be keen to try their halibut next time. This says a lot because travelling to and fro would take about an hour.

Kudos to the lady boss for coming out to engage us in conversation to see if everything was good. You don't get affable services like this in a hawker setting and I honestly think she didn't have to do this, but customer service is ever so demanding right? Well done folks!"
Very good. Dedicated to preparing awesome food.
"This is our first time coming here to have teppanyaki. The female boss is very hospitable. Even came up to our table and asked for our feedbacks. Good attitude.

The mushroom soup is a must to order!
The spaghetti also savoury. My salmon fish also thick and fresh.

Strongly recommend anyone who likes a good value meal."
"Impeccable food quality, taste and service attitude. Food portion is humongous!"
superbly cooked sizzling teppanyaki and commendable service. 2 thumbs up!
"Very friendly staffs and boss. Had a great meal with my 2 kids and my wife. Their Ji Dan Bing,Yan Su Ji and mushroom chicken chop are way above expectations! Especially Yan Su Ji.. its not the hard and dried meat, its meat is tender and the salt taste is just right! Well done guys! Wo Men Hui Zai Lai De!"
"Good Taiwan teppanyaki
I order the beef steak with noodle
Portion size is good
Will come back when I miss Taiwan food"
Great taiwanese food at great value.

"Staff was very polite and meticulous when ordering.

Ordered the chicken chop with noodles. Chicken portion was huge, juicy and tender. The mix sauce goes extremely well with the chicken and noodles. There is an option to change to rice if you want. After the meal, my hunger was extremely satisfied.

Will come and patronise again if I'm in the area !"
"Good was better than expected. Especially the steak. Surprisingly tender.
Mushroom soup was so so.
The pancake was just normal.
But overall, the mains are good.
Will be back for other mains."
"I appreciate the order taking crew. She patiently explained the menu to me and recommended one dish I should go to. The experience was good. The pork chop is above average, not bad. Can eat."

"Kiang Kiang  Taiwan Teppanyaki - grilled meat on sizzling hotplate done in Taiwanese night market style.
Opened by an ex-hotel chef from Taiwan and his ex-SIA flight crew wife, this little stall in a coffee shop in Woodlands is a hidden gem. The offerings at the stall consists of mainly sets of different types of meat such as ribeye steak, chicken chop, pork chop and Halibut fish, with a carbo such as pasta and a vegetable side. Other things to try are common Taiwanese snacks such as egg crepe (Dan Bing) and sweet potato fries.
I tried the:
Grilled Halibut set ($12.50): the soft buttery smooth texture of halibut shined in this dish, and kudo to the chef who did not over-cook the fish. The fish Halibut (Bi Mu Yu) is not commonly found at Singapore's hawker stalls cooking western cuisine. The fish was presented on a bed of al-dente spaghetti with mushroom sauce and beansprouts (an unusual side for local western hawker food, but probably more commonly found in Taiwanese night markets). A sunny side up egg completed the set.
Egg pancake Dan Bing : the crispy texture of the well fried pancake and the simple fragrance of the egg mixture made this a very satisfying snack, reminding me of the food I enjoyed at the breakfast stalls in Taiwan.
The Verdict: If you have enjoyed the food in Taiwanese night markets, the authentic and  good cooking will help you relive the memories of those visits again."
"Picked Mixed Sauce Chicken chop was juicy and tender, I choose noodles and it was so well-cooked I doesn't wanna stop eating. Also ordered a sweet potato fries so crispy that taste like potato chips. Overall the best one I ever had in my life, they had wraps too on their menu but me alone can't ate much, folks that read my comments really really need to go try it out yourself, wouldn't regret it !"
"Beef over done, mayb they serve the wrong doneness to me and my friend. Lady boss offer to exchange. But I was in a hurry and left coz Abit full already"
"Discovered this place on tiktok and came all the way from bedok to try

Really value for money, $13.50 for medium rare ribeye steak with corn, pasta & egg

And the egg crepe was amazing aswell"
"Awesome taste of pork chop but with rock bottom price!

Atmosphere only have 4 stars because hawker centre is not aircon. But thanks to non aircon, I could enjoy yummy but in crazily affordable price."
Good food at affordable price

"Affordable Taiwan teppanyaki, very delicious! Highly recommended!!"
Recommended by good friend Mashi. Came here slightly after 11am. Staff is friendly and took time to explain the different options with the dish. Order the chicken one and the fish one. Overall taste is good.
Definitely worth a visit if ever in the vicinity.
"A smaller sized coffee shop. Most of the food here is quite delicious. I personally recommend the Chinese, it's one of the best here in this coffee shop."
Cutlet taste just like in Taiwan and portion is big enough.
"Forgot to take picture, food nice and service very good."
"The food is nice, the hotplate temperature was thoughtfully managed. The temperature worked very nicely for the noodles but maybe should cushion the rice on the vegetables instead of direct contact. The lady boss(?) was very courteous, cheerful and patient, bringing a lot of positivity to the business. In the Woodlands region such positivity can be somewhat hard to find nowadays, so it's really wonderful. For the Taiwanese-style fried chicken, Xiao La is very mild even for my cautious tastebuds because of the ample portions of meat and carbs, so if you want hearty heat, just go Da La off the bat.

The kopitiam is well-organised; the smokers' corner is off to one side. Trays and dishes are very vigilantly cleared off the tables."
"First try today food is well presented and tasty. Ordered the pork chop along with noodle. Meat is super tender and cooked to perfection to match the black pepper sauce. Nice.
Will try other dishes next time"
Great service and Quality food that will exceed beyond your expectation. Couple boss are friendly and sincere to every customers. Their food options are flexible and love their side dishes as well. Sweet potato fries are solid without too much flour. They also have their special spice powder for Pop corn chicken.
"Visited this stall again. They have a new dish on the menu which is very nice.

The price i paid was well worth it as the steak on the  teppanyaki was thick and cooked to my desired doneness.

Most importantly, was very pleased that the friendly lady boss who did not charge me when I asked for extra mushroom sauce which was very nice.

Keep up your service standard and good quality food!"
Affordable and delicious !

"Heard this place from 8days.
Finally got to try it.
Order the black pepper pork chop (minus the basil as they ran out) and their egg omelette with corn and bacon.
Have to say, not bad on the pork chops as it's tasty and marinated well, spaghetti good too.
Egg omelette could order the ordinary as it's salty on the bacon but good. Taste like prata .."
The fried oyster dish is really unique and delicious 
"Taste of Taiwan. Price wise, Singapore is expensive but the portion is ok. The service is good, feedback about the burnt egg floss crepe and they exchange it and chef apologise and super polite. Taiwanese had good service culture. Too bad didn't manage to catch the boss spent $30"
"Dinner dated 21 Dec 2024, Saturday.
First of all, commenable service to serve the tempura first while it was still piping hot. Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Drizzled with chill powder, which elevated the taste.
When I took the first cut of the chicken, I knew it was going to be tender. Chicken indeed was very tender and well marinated.
Quantity of peppery pasta was well enough for me. Went well with the black pepper sauce I opted for.
Beansprouts were cooked well, crunchy with every bite.
Thumps up for this satisfactory meal."
Wow! That's how I went after my first bite. I finally made it there after months of tiktoking.. didn't expect much but.... It's really a must-try!! Cherry also made the effort to reach out for a chat after our meals. Her voice and tone will make you feel as if you are onboard SQ.
Restaurant quality food at cofeeshop prices. Chicken and pork were so tender and the sauce was deliciously flavored with herbs and spices. Would reccomend to make a trip down.
"Located inside Chang Cheng kopitiam. Staff is very friendly. Order the Pork collar with black pepper sauce. Serve in hot plate like in TW. Pork is really soft, tender and succulent. Lightly marinated. No porky smell. Black pepper sauce adds some kick. Taste good with the pork and rice. Serving is generous. You get like 3 pieces of pork with sides of corn and sunny side up. Would come back to try other items. Lots of parking spaces. Kopitiam is well lit and bright. Very clean as well."
"This has relived my Taiwan trip with a sizzling hot plate filled with spaghetti, a runny sunny side up, and a huge piece of chicken/pork shop. I tried the pork and halibut fillet. Pork is so tender, different from what you can get in a normal western hawker stall. A very satisfying meal! Will definitely come back for more "
"food is amazing. have been here with my family more than 5 times. chicken chop, pork chop, and steak all done well. as good as the ones we have had in taiwan. highly recommended!!!"
good authentic tw steak food
Very Good service thanks you
Below average.. Not worth it ..
"delicious, quality food at reasonable prices! got to try their new item Dan Bing with bacon n corns it was mind-blowingggggggg "
The steak was delicious and sumptuous. Lady Boss is friendly too. Highly recommended.
Authentic Taiwanese western hotplate. Chicken was well marinated and flavourful. Very juicy and tender basil pork as well. Egg yolk was runny and nice.
"The serving portions are generous, and the food tastes great, offering excellent value for money. There aren't many teppanyaki western restaurants in Singapore, making this place quite unique. The customer service is commendable, and what truly impressed me is their attentiveness to customer feedback, continuously fine-tuning and improving. Given that food and taste are highly subjective, it's challenging to please everyone, but they do a remarkable job. Definitely worth a visit!"

Love the friendly staff/boss! Always serving customer with a smile. Ordered the ribeye and it's amazing for coffeeshop standard! Price is very reasonable. Added on a pork chop and it's so tender and delicious! Would definitely come back again! Really glad that this gem is near my house 
Pork chop was tender and not hard. The amount is acceptable. Will try other food next time.
"Alright, folks, listen up! Donkey and I were looking for a quick and tasty Western meal, and we were pleasantly surprised by Hang Kiang Taiwan Teppanyaki in Woodlands. From the outside, with its modern Korean-inspired logo, we thought it was a Korean stall, but it turns out this spot serves delicious Taiwanese Teppanyaki!

What We Loved:

* The Service: We were impressed by the friendly service. The staff were very helpful in recommending dishes, and they were happy to accommodate our requests for less rice and noodles. We also appreciated their willingness to add extra beansprouts--a real plus for a coffeeshop setting!

* The Food: We both found our meals to be above average. The halibut in my Halibut set was cooked perfectly--flaky, moist, and flavorful. I loved the tenderness of the beef in my beef set, and the beef was well-made for a coffeeshop standard. We both really enjoyed the sauces, although we did find the chili sauce to be a bit too sweet.

* The Ambiance: Even though Hang Kiang Taiwan Teppanyaki is situated within a coffeeshop, it doesn't feel stuffy at all. There's plenty of ventilation and it's cool and comfortable inside.

* The Staff: We loved the warm welcome we received from the staff when we went to collect our meals. They were so friendly and helpful, even offering us a basket of Halloween sweets!  That was a lovely gesture, especially since Halloween had already passed!

What We Didn't Love:

* The Chili Sauce: We did find the chili sauce to be a bit too sweet. It was a bit of a jarring contrast with the savory flavors of the hot plate.

Donkey's Take: The food was pretty good, and the staff were really friendly!

My Take: I loved the halibut! It was cooked perfectly.""

Rating:

* Food: 4/5 (Delicious and well-prepared dishes)

* Service: 5/5 (Friendly, helpful, and accommodating)

* Atmosphere: 4/5 (Comfortable and well-ventilated)

Our Verdict: Overall, we recommend Hang Kiang Taiwan Teppanyaki for a decent Western meal. It's not a fancy spot, but the food is good enough, the service is friendly, and it's a great option for a quick and enjoyable meal. We especially appreciate the friendly service and the willingness to accommodate our individual preferences."
"Kitty and I were looking for a quick and tasty Western meal, and we were pleasantly surprised by Hang Kiang Taiwan Teppanyaki in Woodlands.

We both really enjoyed the sauces, although we did find the chili sauce to be a bit too sweet.  It was a bit of a jarring contrast with the savory flavors of the hot plate.

We also noticed that some online reviews mention the sauces being bland.  However, Kitty and I found the sauce to be just right--not too salty or overpowering.  It seems that taste preferences vary, so if you prefer a stronger sauce, you might find this one a little light.  But for those who prefer a less salty and less intense flavor, you might enjoy it as much as we did!

The restaurant is self-service, and you're given a buzzer when your food is ready. What we loved was the warm welcome we received from the staff when we went to collect our meals.

Remember, don't set your expectations too high in comparison with any cafe or restaurant so that you will enjoy your meal and experience in this store."
"Loved the food! I ordered the teppenyaki chicken chop. Came with taiwanese pearl rice which was super fragrant! The chicken chop serving was also quite big and well seasoned, with a nice crispy exterior yet not losing the tender interior.
Definitely will come back again!"
Portion can be slightly bigger. The black pepper needs to modify a bit to suit the taste for kids and adults like a classic old school sweet and savoury pepper sauce. Vegetable options can be more variety.
"Excellent hotplate fusion cuisine tucked in a kopitiam. Meat was super tender, quality of ingredients above expectations, and the sauce is done well without the usual gooey starchy sauce you'd expect from local western stalls. 9/10 will come again."

"Enjoy the taste and tenderness of the ribeye and halibut. Price is reasonable too. The lady boss is very polite and welcoming. However, the noodle portion is a bit small, so I'd recommend opting for rice if you're looking for a more filling meal."
"I read about the stall owner couple's love story, very touching, wanted to give them some support, thus, came to try their food.
This is the 2nd time we tried, the chicken chop is nice! The service is excellent!
The stall owners are very friendly and sincere to serve their customers.

"It has been about 4-5 months since their opening , and I've been here at least once a week. Every single time, I'll order the basil pork set. It is the best pork chop I've ever eaten. Standard does not change as well. I have ordered almost 20 over times, and everytime it is as tender as ever! The black pepper sauce with pork chop is definitely on point! A good place for dinner after a day of hard work, it soothes ur weary soul!"
"I came with high expectations due to the good reviews on social media and the high rating on Google, further encouraged by the steady stream of customers. However, I found the Basil Pork Set just okay, not mind-blowing. Perhaps it was a case of having set my expectations too high."
The food was very nice
"At $13.50 for a ribeye, the price is hard to beat. Albeit, it was thin but made up for it with the size. Probably pounded to enlarge the surface area. Order medium rare but as expected of hawker standard and probably because of the lack of thickness, it was more medium to medium well. What's important though was the taste of lack of it. Steak was under seasoned, pepper sauce didn't take away nor added to the steak, more like a no-show. Only the chili sauce added on the side imparted some semblance of flavour. Egg on the side was a nice touch but alas again without any flavor same with the bean sprouts that was way overcooked and true to the other elements, was devoid of any flavour with only the ""grassiness"" of the sprouts standing out like a punch to the tongue. The display of the dish promises much but the lack of flavor brings you down and bury the dish 6 foot under."
"Service was excellent by the ever friendly staff. Food were awesome too, my family & I order chicken, pork & lamb chops and they were all delicious  100% will return to try other proteins!"
"Second Time Ordering from Kiang Kiang! Food Portion is very generous & Staff is very friendly!
Their Meat is very tender, personally prefer their Pork over Beef. There is two kind of sauce, Mushroom & Black Pepper, you can also choose to mix both sauce! Also, CDC voucher is allowed to use here "

My wife bought food for me from this shop. It's alright.
Pork still raw in middle. Flap of meat at the corner was folded up. Middle not cooked. Pls be careful when cooking
"Portion is generous, recommended"

Shou Xi De Wei Dao!
"Nice food, authentic Taiwan taste."
"Happen to be around the woodland area after work and decided to pay this place a visit after knowing about their stall on social media. Reached the place around 8plus in the evening and noticed many customers having their food. Over here, they have 4 items, chicken, beef, fish, and pork. You can choose either pasta or rice for the carbs. I ordered the chicken chop set, which was SGD$8.50. I was issued the buzzer after payment was made and didn't had to wait long before my food was ready.

The portion was really generous, the chicken chop was huge. Apart from the pasta, it also comes with egg and corn. I had the mixed of black pepper and mushroom sauce, which I find it a little salty.

Overall, food was not bad and would definitely recommend. Would try their other dish next time."
Tried many many times. Standard will drop quite a lot during peak lunch and dinner hours. So be warned if eating during those timings. Prepare to be disappointed like me many times

"Food taste great and service was excellent.  Coffee shop a little bit squeezy but manageable.

Great experience overall"
Heard so much about this stall.  Opened by ex-SIA stewardess and her husband. Best to come before lunch time to avoid the queue.  There are 4 sets to choose from.  I tried the halibut set and went with rice. Nice.  Next time I would want to try the chicken chop set.
Basil pork chop was good and the spaghetti was soft!
There's definitely room for improvement for the pork chop.
"Went all the way from Ubi  to try out their Basil Pork Chop Mixed Sauce  and Hailbut black Pepper Sauce. And all is really very nice .
And their customer service is very good .
Keep up the good work . 

Will definitely come again to try their other dishes ."
" LEGIT Taiwanese-Western fusion food

Stall owner is a true taiwanese gentleman and his wife was very courteous and friendly when taking my order.

Offering a culinary experience that is both familiar and unexpected. I love their chicken chop and pasta, it is a symphony of flavors that showcases the best of both worlds.

The centerpiece of the dish is the tender, juicy chicken chop, coated in mixed black pepper and mushroom sauce that is both savory and slightly spicy.

The sauce's depth of flavor is evident in every bite, with the subtle nuances of black pepper and earthy mushrooms complementing each other beautifully.

The pasta, cooked al dente to maintain its texture, is perfectly seasoned in the flavorful sauce.

Overall, a truly satisfying dinner and I can't wait to try their rice!"
"Big portion, good service. Very filling and something new for the palatte other than the usual local food we are eating!"
"Food is great, well seasoned taste very good. The pork in tender. Worth the travel to eat the food, the service also fast and smooth. The staff and chef was very friendly. Must give a try."
Was expecting black pepper noodles that you'd eat for breakfast in Taiwan but pasta was ok because it was cooked nicely. The chicken chop was cooked perfectly but the black pepper sauce could be more savoury and less sweet but overall a nice experience!
The chicken chop was tender and tasty. Love the meal. It was generous and filling.
"Let's talk about the chicken chop, shall we? This dish definitely delivered on flavor, offering a delightful twist with the option to mix and match between mushroom and black pepper sauces--like a culinary choose-your-own-adventure book, but with less reading and more eating! You can also choose between rice or pasta as your carb, along with sides of bean sprouts or corn; however, as a self-proclaimed carb lover, I found the portion size a tad underwhelming, leaving me space for desserts. The presentation of the food is undoubtedly a standout feature - check out the oozing egg. The service here deserves a standing ovation! It's a breath of fresh air compared to the typical grouchy uncles and aunties at hawker centers, with genuinely friendly staff who even informed us about the expected waiting time due to a backlog of orders. As for the ambiance, it's located in a coffee shop, so don't expect Michelin-star dining--it's more of a ""grab your food and go"" vibe, which is fine if you're not looking for a romantic dinner date."
"Piping hot teppanyaki chicken chop with fragrant Taiwan rice and sunny side up. Chicken is meaty and tasty, staff was very friendly to introduce their menu."
"Maybe I have a different expectation.  Overall, this place is ordinary.  The pepper sauce definitely needs improvement, and the oval hot plate is hard to eat out of.  The chicken is good. However, the steak is somewhat wanting.  I appreciate the hard work that is put into the place, so please keep it up."
"My family decided to give it a try since we stay in the north. It was well worth it!

The mixed sauce was really special , portion of the food is worth the price point.

Location may not be ideal but it's worth the travel for those in the east and west.

Tried three mains while we were there, will be back to try the basil pork set! They ran out of basil leaf the day we went.

Can use your CDC voucher too!"
"Food is tasty, and portioning is reasonable.  The basil pork was a bit overcooked and was tough.  Fish and beef were fine.  However, they seemed to be repeatedly running out of ingredients.  Third time visiting and was faced with some items running out, even as early as 6pm.  Waiting time was also on the long side, averaging 30 minutes after queueing for more than 15 mins just to order.  However, the owner was polite when taking orders and apologetic for the run out items. The coffee shop they're housed in had become smoky and greasy with the hot plate cooking and can get stuffy.   Maybe that explained why the external seats were all taken lately since the stall's addition to the coffeeshop."
"Food was amazing  I don't know about the rest or how the shop marinates their meat, but my first bite into the chicken without any sauce taste so good! So, needless to say that it's even better with their in house sauces! 10/10"
Taiwan night market teppanyaki. Taste quite close to what I ate in Taiwan. Thumb up 
Taiwan style Teppanyaki
"I was greeted with smiles by the lady boss.
Ordered the Basil Pork ($9.50) Waiting time was short on Sunday late morning, 11ish.
The food was good but it might not be suitable for those who are afraid of the pork smell which the pork chop did have a bit."
Great value and super friendly service...  Had the chicken chop and fish taste flavourful.
"We had mixed sauce (mushroom and black pepper), pasta and bean sprout. The food is good value for money. The steak is medium rare and just nice for u to enjoy at medium."
"Taste is good. Portion is good. Not wow.
Price, $9.50 for Pork Chop basil. Will I come back again just for this? Nope."
Located in a coffeeshop . Food is delicious and hot .
"Came at 7:20. I asked if they're still open. Staff didn't seem to understand the question. Rephrased it to. ""Can I still order?"" She still didn't understand. She had to ask the boss. And he said not accepting orders anymore. Better come early if you want to eat their food"
"Food was nice. Portion was big. But the coffeeshop ventilation was not very good. Very hot and stuffy. The customer service, cashier side was very polite,  really make you feel like sitting in a business class SQ . She learn her skill and apply well."
"Sauce tasted weird. Maybe it's Taiwan style, but too sweet for my liking."
"A new addition to Woodlands which usually doesn't have exciting things. Extremely generous portion for the price $8.50. Liked the bean sprouts because they taste very fresh. Lady boss was also very friendly, like some of the others said SQ service.

Definitely recommended to come patron"
"Ordered their popular steak and basil pork teppanyaki, the meats are well marinated together with the sauce and cook to perfection! The steak took 5 bites to be chewed fully which is very rare as a neighbourhood hawker food The pasta is super flavourful and think it has a little wok hei to it (?) So glad that it is situated in my neighbourhood "
"Good food made with care and passion
, polite customer service."
"Nice, friendly. Will go again"
"Read about this niche little 'hideout' from a local blog, and must admit, must try. Always loved Taiwanese food & after reading rave reviews, decided to travel all the way from Pasir Ris (why don't they have something similar in the East?? - maybe there is, but not to my knowledge) to try this out. Must admit the portion is generous & serving plate is HOT which is sizzling. Very friendly couple and the taste of this pork chop with basil is quite tantalizing, so much so it's all gobbled down in like 5 mins !!
It's the right mix, spaghetti is nicely done, and the meat is not overly done - just right. Love the mixed flavours - maybe a bit more basil would be nice :)
Decided to take out the halibut to try at home. Wishing the couple all the best in their venture & keep up the excellent food service and smiles !!"
"Located in a kopitiam in Woodlands, this humble Taiwanese hot plate grill stall offers a satisfying dining experience. When it comes to carbs, you get to choose between rice or pasta, and for a side of fibre, it's corn or beansprouts. The sauces available are mushroom, black pepper, or mixed.

The prices are incredibly affordable for the quality and portions offered.
We opted for the mixed sauce, which was a great choice. It's really rich, thick, and coats both the meat and noodles beautifully.

Ribeye Steak Set ($13.50)
The steak, though cooked medium-rare, and the seasoning was light, which might be the intended style for a Taiwanese hot plate steak. The sauce really helps to tie the dish together!
I rate: 3.5/5 

Chicken Chop Set ($8.50)
The chicken chop was the highlight. It was tender, flavourful, and slicing through it, which was smooth and really soft! I rally like the grilled side where it's mildily crispy and the skin is so rich in seasoning marinade. Really best dish! The corn also adds sweetness to it.
I rate: 5/5 

We'll definitely be back to try the pork chop someday! :D"
"Found this stall selling Teppanyaki noodles in Woodlands. Decided to give a try and no regret. Had a very delightful meal with my wife. We ordered pasta with beef and pork chop with rice. I would recommend go with their mixed sauce. Overall, it was a yummy lunch and worth the try."
"Ordered chicken chop, spaghetti and bean sprouts. Lady boss was very friendly but then while i was eating i think they are filming for social media... Abit cringe but if you get entertained by behind the scenes maybe this for you.

Spaghetti feels jolly bee level not the taste but the texture so if that is your thing you will like it. I am indifferent and also feels it is abit too sweet.

Beansprouts is there average not special nor offensive. The egg was appropriate, i find having hot plate made it nicely cooked.

Chicken wise it doesn't taste much but it was well grilled and crispy. The mixed sauce gave a much needed flavor profile but as you can see from the picture didn't cover the whole chicken chop hopefully they can give more so that every slice can go with the sauce if there was not much marination done to the chicken."
Chicken chop here was thick and juicy! Meat was grilled very nicely! Taste very delicious when everything is still hot. The pasta was delicious too! Worth a try if you are around the vicinity!
"Very friendly Lao Ban Niang
Food is very good
Will definitely visit again"
Go for the chicken + spaghetti
"Reach before 7pm on weekdays.
Off on tues n wed. Que start to build. The front lady is very friendly and nice. Order Mushroom chicken and Black pepper pork. Waiting time 30mins min. Both are nice, but i prefer BP when im not a BP person :D

Spag is nice too (seasoned) Will come back and try their fish soon!!"
"Visited the place on a Saturday. I love that you can customize the kind of sides, carb and even add on protein (at an affordable price, a thick cut of chicken chop for only $4) Waited for 15mins for our meals which was reasonable given that we were there during the lunch crowd.

We both had the steak which is served medium rare but given that it is served on the hotplate you can easily cook it to your liking. We also added on chicken chop and find that the chicken chop was well seared and crispy on the outside and a thick cut. It's highly value for money as the portion is big and add ons are affordable and reasonable.

Would like to commend on the lady at the cashier for her cheerful disposition and also checking on our satisfaction after the meal as we didn't finish our carbs (we don't take so much carb). In the future we will omit the carb when ordering and I find that Kiang Kiang is very accommodating and customizable and will definitely return in the near future."
Food was good and generous but I personally prefer the sauce to be less sweet and salty. The staff was very nice to check if the sauces contain any shellfish as I am allergic to it.
Ordered their chicken set and pork set . It's very good . I think the pork set is more worth it . The pasta is a lot though .
I brought my family from west to support them after reading the news. Portion was generous and the meat were well cooked. The service lady was nice. They could put more sauce on the plate as the sauce would dry up fast due to the heat. The  sauce was a bit sour and sweet to us and it could be their own recipe. It was always subjective to everyone preference.
"This afternoon my parents and i enjoyed a delightful meal at Kiang Kiang Teppanyaki, ordering three sets of chicken chop for my parents and myself. The experience was exceptional, from the generous portions to the excellent service. The hot plate was heavy, but the attentive staff were quick to assist my parents, ensuring their meals were brought to the table safely. The food itself was prepared with genuine passion, evident in every bite. It was heartwarming to see young couples so dedicated to their culinary craft. Overall, a thoroughly satisfying dining experience. Pa and Ma say is yummy and they ask me to bring them back to the place againWishing them continued success and keep up the momentum Jia you "
"Saw so many good reviews but my steak didn't turn out so well. Beef was a bit bland, and I asked for more sauce which they gave willingly .  Still the beef was so tough to chew on. I wonder what Ribeye they are using to achieve this rubbery texture. I did not even finish my steak coz I got tired of chewing.
Lady boss and boss is very courteous non the less.
Sauce is average at most. But portion is good. Hits and misses. But they will survive because their video is going viral.
Will probably be back only if I'm in the area and try the pork, chicken or halibut. Maybe something was wrong with my piece of steak. But I wish them all the best."
"Service is good. Thought I was boarding SQ.

Ordered steak and halibut. Steak was slightly more chewy, but still good. Taste wise, its good.

Halibut is fresh!

Got the mixed sauce with Pasta. Very flavourful."
Food is good but black pepper taste weird
"If you miss the taste of Taiwan night market, you need to drop by to this stall and get your cravings satisfied!! Authentic taste of Taiwan "
"1st time trying this stall. Longest q in the coffee shop. Waiting time can be as long as 1hr. Ordered 1 chicken chop and 1 halibut. Not sure why the texture of the halibut taste like dory fish. Food sold out at 1215pm, damn early, leaving lots of customers disappointed in the q. Think they need to increase the food supply qty. Food taste was ok, though they could be more generous on the qty of beansprouts. Lady boss friendly a plus pt."
"Food is served very hot on hotplate which is very nice. The chicken is really fresh! Can choose 2 sides between rice or pasta, bean sprouts or corn. Also choose to have mixed sauces (both mushroom and black pepper).
However I think the sauces is too flavourful and quite sour. I might come back when I have craving for strong flavoured food. Quite a long queue during dinner time too."
"Well worth the wait, waited for around 50 mins during peak hr, owner was courteous and attentive, service was top notch. I had the basil pork chop which was tender and flavourful, the spaghetti side was perfect, my dad ate the chicken chop which was grilled to perfection and went well with the fluffy white rice. 10/10 would visit again."
"Food served hot, decent portion, affordable price. Friendly and smiley lady boss, great service . According to the 8days article, the dishes are authentic Taiwanese teppanyanki. Unfortunately, I have never tasted Taiwanese teppanyaki, so I don't know what it tastes like. The beef dish has a little sourish taste, and the sourish taste is even more on the pork chop with spaghetti. The sourish is not on the bad side as if it is spoilt, I believe it is the marinate or seasoning. That said, the food is still fine, however, not to my liking becos of the light sourish taste. Finally, best of all is lady boss   service , I wish more stalls can adopt her attitude and service. Still, I wish them all the best."
Great food with generous amount
"The serving was very good .
The lady have a very good serving and nice tone , chatting with her made our day well .

The portion is very big and the food is nicee. I like the corns too, it was sweet and baked, the texture is good
It was a pity that pasta and Beansprouts is sold out.
It was worth a try and definitely will visit again"
"For someone who travel to Taiwan countless time, i wonder why I have yet to try their Hotplate Steak & Pasta, a popular night market dish.

So here I come. The thickness and the quality of the steak was more than enough to win me over. However, I wasn't used to the 'sweet' black pepper sauce(did the chef comes fr Tainan?). As the condiment chilli sauce was already on the sweet side, their should give the black pepper sauce a spicy profile, something they should consider tweaking."
High quality ingredients used. Recommend chicken and fish. Pork was a tad hard. Good SQ service.
"Came down with my family and we all loved it!

I must commend the couple for their ability to serving their customers fast upon order as I received mine within 5 to 10 minutes.

I ordered the steak set and it was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The black pepper sauce was unique and to my liking as it was not overly spicy unlike some food stalls and the sweetness brings a different flavour compared to other stalls.

My family ordered the Basil Pork set which had two huge tender cuts, coated with the mushroom sauce where actual mushrooms are visible.

The pasta is al-dante and not overcooked and along with the sauce, it is easy to eat without feeling any jelatness.

Will definitely visit again and introduce to others to give it a try!"
"Fei Chang Hao Chi 
Mo Gu Jiang Hen Ke Yi!"
"Second time visiting this lovely couple's teppanyaki store. I have tried the beef and chicken set and both exceeds my expectation. Sauce is homemade and flavorful while the meat is well marinated and generously portioned. Highly recommended.

*usually the egg is runny, fully cooked at my request / personal preference*"
food was good! wishing this stall all the best. loved the spaghetti noodles with the tasty sauce (i got mixed which is both black pepper and mushroom)
"Pasta is al dente and soaks up the sauce well! Large portion of chicken. Crispy skin with THICC juicy meat. Sauce just a little salty, but I think it would go well with plain rice."
"Support local biz!!!

First of all, liked the small customization of the food. Owner is friendly.

Had the black pepper sauce chicken chop with spaghetti and corn, comes with an egg too for 8.50.

Meat is thick, skin is grilled cripsy. Black pepper sauce is kinda spicy and sour, personally i don't like it. But it's not bad just need to get used to a different taste.

Overall for the price and taste is  will definitely come again."
I did had a very good impression when i came to this store to buy some takeaway recently..not only the service was very good indeed..the food tasted very good too..felt so happy and lucky eating it. I highly recommend it to everyone. Keep up the good work
Tried this new stall today and really liked it! Loved both the chicken and pork. Would come back to try the fish next time. Service was good and friendly too.
"Despite being in an unexpected location, this Taiwanese shop is a delightful find. The food makes the trip worthwhile, especially the pork chop, which is soft and tender with minimal ""pork"" smell, except in the fatty parts. The service, provided by the energetic lady boss, is outstanding and reminiscent of the friendly nature of Taiwanese people. Her warm and attentive service truly brightens the day."
"Great food, great attitude, will definitely eat this whenever in the area"
"The basil pork set was fantastic! The pork was incredibly tender and flavorful, and the sauce had a perfect balance of savory, salty, and slightly sweet. I added chicken and corn to the set, and it cooked perfectly alongside the pork. The portion size was great, and I loved the vegetables included, especially the bean sprouts. The stall is run by a young couple, had a warm and welcoming vibe."
"I tried the pork and halibut set. The portion sizes were very generous, so you will leave completely full and satisfied. The mushroom sauce complemented the meats perfectly. I especially loved that they allow customers to customise the sides and sauces. Highly recommend anyone looking for a fulfilling and hearty meal!!!"
"You got to try this Taiwanese teppanyaki stall in Woodlands, run by an amazing young couple! The food is unbelievably fresh and flavorful. Their special sauces really hit the spot! Confirm plus chop, highly recommended!

Ordered pork and chicken set "
"Had this last Sunday 
I like their packaging for dabao, it's very nice! (Wanted to dine in actually but the weather cmi)
Food and portion wise overall is very good! The pasta is a MUST TRY, it goes very well with the course. The mushroom sauce comes with real mushrooms for mushroom lovers like me 

Ordered Chicken Chop (8.5) and Basil Pork Chop (9.5) with the choice of pasta/rice, sweet corn/flavourful taugeh and sauce where you can pick mushroom/black pepper/mix. Highly recommend their basil pork chop!!

Side note: please don't be like me that didn't check their opening hours  we reached there at 8pm (closing time) and they just nice switched off the lights alrdy  really fortunate that lao ban niang help to asked her husband if able to make one more portion for us  CRAVINGS SATISFIED"
"Newly opened Ye Shi Niu Pai by a young couple. Probably the first of its kind here.

Uses Taiwanese style marinate of salt and pepper for its meat. Portion was big, and female colleague couldn't finish her fish set.

You get to choose the carbs (rice or pasta), sauce (mushroom, black pepper or mixed) and veg(bean sprouts or corn)

Halibut was tender and and juicy. Slightly crispy on the outside.
Pork was tender and tasty. Will be back to try other meats.

Could do with bigger serving of sauce as it dries up really quickly on the hot plate and couldn't coat all the rice as well."
the reason i gave 3 for the food is because of their black pepper even tho mushroom can be nice but most people enjoy black pepper . Their pepper is some what sweet and not enuf black pepper taste . maybe it's your style but in my opinion i think it's best when it is spicy

"Portion is fish is quite ok, soup is a bit bland but with Chinese wine taste.

Slow service. Only has one cook even during peak hours. The food doesnt have much taste either probably because the chef had too many orders to rush and fulfill
Very nice 
"This is one of the outlets of king of fried rice. Located below the Blk 166 Woodlands St 13. For this stall, I had tasted the XO fried rice as well as the Tom Yum fried rice with pork cutlet. The advertisement comparing the pork cutlet to Ding Tai Fung was quite true. The pork cutlet had a similar taste and was equally flavorful. It was also quite thick.

I also love the XO fried rice as well. I would prefer XO one comparing with the Tom Yum one. I have not tasted the mala one. Will definitely try it soon."
"Service staff like not happy want to work. Like I owe him money , I only ordering food for take away only get fed up and angry tone for what.....! Not happy resign from job."
"Ordered 2 pack of eggs fried rice and was given scratch card. Lucky! I gotten a free topping of luncheon meat and wanted to redeem immediately. The staff rejected the redemption and said that is for next purchase. I read thru the conditions and did not say we cannot redeem or next visit. The staffs said it was their Manager instruction. Why stop customer to redeem if you want to run a promotion. I may not live around the area and will not come back here again. Very disappointed and return the card to the stall. I believe the staffs saw my disappointment and unhappiness, they add the free item to me and told me they added although their manager instruction was next visit. Thumb up to the chief for his quick recovery but supposing a happy feeling turned to a dissatisfied purchase. Still give 3 Stars as the food quality is good."
"Still my favourite fried rice in term tom yum fried rice.

Less and no queue during lunch time, carpark just behind the coffee shop and nearby got atm at oppsite the road.

The fried rice  is good. And i still like their  fried dried chilli."
Gave me wrong order! Tom yum fried rice became normal fried rice
Excellent indeed.
Pretty good.
"One of our go-to food for our family. Amazing Pork and Chicken cutlet with egg fried rice. I would strongly recommend adding the chilli into the rice. Similar to DTF standard, but half the price. Bring your containers OK? Saves environment and cost."
Ordered takeaway XO fried rice with pork cutlet but was given egg fried rice sans cutlet. Shocked to see another customer had a similar issue
Fried rice is good. But a bit pricey for hawker center.
"pls, hire more worker, waiting time for order is super long.."
"Taste good , friendly crew . But must wait 15mins usually"
Delicious pork cutlet fried rice at affordable price. Pork cutlet is thick and it taste as good as that from Ding Tai Feng.. Hopefully there won't be a price increase after 1 Jan 2024.
"The chef who doesn't know how to work at the cashier, who serve a woman who cut into the queue. Still argue with the cashier on the side who knows that Im in the queue before the woman.
Worse is he still mumble behind after being told.
Left without order and would not patron again."
"Very bad experience...Don't understand why the foreign cashier are allow to bring her young kids to work... Playing/ running /shouting ,not only distracting  her and also disturbing other queing customers.."
Awesome food with reasonable cost but food is restaurant standards.

Ordered self pick up from grab at 12.40 pm. Grab status said it was ready for collection at 1 pm. I arrived at 1.27pm and the person then told the chef to start cooking now eventhough they clearly only had a few orders. I had to wait 15+ minutes for the food. Might as well I don't self pick up. Defeats the purpose right?! Even the customer that ordered after I arrived received their order first.
Your female cashier staff is so rude . Very very rude from my encounter while I was eating there.
For some reason it's not as good as the other branch. Lack of wok hey. But the chili is still very delicious.
"Queue is much lesser now.  Perhaps the novelty has worn off, and the price had overtaken the appeal. Quality is maintained. Good job. "
Waited for 50 mins after ordered! Not recommended at all!
Cheap pork cutlet with decent fried rice.
"Slow service, waited for more than half an hour, ended up give orders to those behind mine. I questioned the staff and just keep quiet.

To the owner, if you want to focus on delivery business, might as well don't open for dine in."
"Not worth to buy this tomyam fried rice,like the home cook taste,like this taste I also can cook myself,pork chop also too salty!I will not buy again like this fried rice!"
"Paid for 2 fried eggs. Only received 1.

Waiting time was very long despite there not being much crowd."
Taste good & nice environment food court.
Good food.
"You can find all sorts of fried rice here, you name it."
"I thought 2 instead of Only 1 chef managed the stove during the peak hour, what happened?
Anyway I bought 1 packet of signature FR back home and tried it, the presentation looked and the food tasted decent."
Order Egg Fried rice w/ pork chop. Definitely worth down to eat it. Meat was tender. Rice was so umami. Better than din Tai fung
Not bad their fried rice. Will cone back.
"Food is pretty oily but quite nice. Not the most filling/worth for it's price point. Cashier auntie did not quite hear my order and gave me the wrong order (I pointed and said) but after checking and bringing up to her, she helped to change it (1min after order taken). In a coffee shop so atmosphere is as you would expect. However, it is decorated quite nicely and bright. There is a smoking area as well as a non smoking area."
Have tried better fried rice
"Don't really taste special enough to be called a ""king""."
"Ordered Pork Cutlet Fried Rice, but it came without the pork! Standard has dropped alot too, fried rice has weird taste now"
"I want to complain about the cashier at night at King of Fried Rice ( Outlet: Woodlands at Blk 166). She has a very bad working attitude. She is very impatient and she will keep pressing the number bell non stop when the food is ready. It is really annoying and it makes me feel like she is rushing me to get my food when there are no other people ordering from the shop.
I feel that her attitude is very bad and she doesn't smile when she is serving customers. She makes me feel that we all owe her a living.
I feel that the management from King of Fried Rice should do soemthing about this employee. If she still continue to work with this attitude, I strongly believe that nobody will support this outlet anymore."
"Flavorful fried rice. A pity it comes with mostly fried meat. Portion is just right, but  more rice would be good!"
"Rang Xiao Fei Zhe Deng Tai Jiu,Bu Gen Dan Hao Zou,Gong Zuo Ding Dan Du Hui Bu Jian,Ge Ren Jue De Fu Wu Shi Huan Ke Yi,Shi Wu Shi Fei Chang De Tui Jian,Ke Shi Chu Shi Xu Yao Gai Jin,Qing Gen Dan Hao Zou"
"Horrible... standing at the Cashier counter more than 10min not served. Waiting time horrible more than 30min. Number not running at all.
Horrible King Of Fried Rice"
Taking almost half an hour waiting for fried rice after order
"Meh, told them pork cutlet gimme chicken chop. Chicken chop is below average, rice itself is average"
Fragrance fried rice. Best in woodlands.
"Worst the price
Pork chop is juicy and big portion"
We really love their pork chop fried rice!
A gem for sure. There was so much egg in the rice that it looked like egg with rice  Will definitely go back for more!
"the fried rice is abit dry and hard compared to goldenmile , wish they improve in future"
The Pork chop fried rice is most value for money option.
KOFR + fried rice with different favors
Different stall outlets different standard.  Woodlands stall fried rice a bit damp and too much msg/salt.
Fried rice is up to expectation. But didn't know that the pork chop is added with black pepper. Kids find that too spicy.
Our order was miss out. And we go and check with the lady Cashier she was not happy and say you cannot wait huh! When i order that time 4pm had no order when we realised ppl came after us got their order that why we approach the lady nicely and get these kind of attitude  We no need apologise just admit that you missed out our order. Four ppl inside doing nothing really don't understand! Don't worry i definitely won't be back. One day you get rid of one customer than you all can do less job 
"Definitivamente, si lo que buscas es un arroz frito (para los peruanos ""arroz chaufa"") sabroso, contundente y bien preparado, este es el lugar (se parece muchisimo al ""fried rice"" o ""chaufan"" que ofrecen en la afamada cadena de restaurantes Din Tai Fung). KOFR (King of Fried Rice) es una cadena de restaurantes, el de Woodlands esta ubicado en un ""hawker"" (lo famosos y muy concurridos restaurantes que se ubican en los HDB --las viviendas financiadas por el estado, donde viven mas del 85% de los singapurenses--). Aunque pudiera ser elevado en grasa para algunos gustos, es muy sabroso y vale la pena probarlo."
Tried the pork chop fried rice. Not bad. Seen a lot people eating this. The meat given was quite big. The name suggest their fried rice is top end. Ok lah.
"Basically a neighbourhood version of Wok Hey with some extra types of fried rice. The rice they use is the same one as Wok Hey uses.

I ordered the shrimp fried rice from this stall. In my opinion it's a little on the pricey side. There's less prawns than Wok Hey."
Not as good as advertised
"Pu Tong Chao Fan +Yue Nan Feng Wei Zhu Ba +La Jiao Ban Mian De La Jiao
..."
"Budget din Tai Fung, nothing wrong with this but like all budget things can be a hit or miss at times when they aren't overwhelmed by orders it taste just like din Tai Fung fried rice but when they are it might occasionally be of a lower quality than it should be"
Very good fried rice!! I give 5 stars and 5 thumbs up
Living up to it's name in the north.
"Well, the fried pork cutlet fried rice($6.50) is easy to bite. Slightly oily.... Pricing is above premium as compared to normal ZiChar stall. Portion is about 1 normal bowl size. Provided their own special mala chilli sauce. Required an axtra of 30c for take away.
Update: try their new truffle fried rice! Taste gd too, of coz will come with a price of $8.50 for the pork chop version."
Food look good.
Great fried rice. Enjoying it now.
It's good fried rice. Expect to pay about $6 for their workhorse classic (Pork Chop Fried Rice). Note that this coffee shop stall only accepts cash!
Best fried rice food chain I have tasted ever!
"Have been visiting the brand at various location. Currently the one in woodland, the taste matches about 75% to the original store at golden Mile. However, the other flavour may need a extra work on."
People are waiting while the only chef is busy looking at his phone.
"There was no order when I arrived in the afternoon. I order pork cutlet fried rice. The cook proceed to fried the rice  After that, once the rice is ready, the lower the pork cutlet into the frying machine. My rice gets cold while waiting for the pork cutlet. The next order came and the person immediately received his order after mine. He gets to fried his pork cutlet with mine. Looks like they don't want to fry one piece, but rather wait for more to fry together. Got savings? At tis price, didn't expect this kind of move."
Quality check please.. 
Really not bad
"My usual order is 1C, fried rice with pork chop. I find it is comparable to Din Tai Fun, only cheaper and bigger serving. I buy from here at least a few times a month. Tried the tomyum fried rice but found the tomyum flavor very light. Didn't find it worth the extra price paid. I also like the chilli that comes with an order. Yum!"
"Overprice, don't see what is worth the price stated."
Half the price of DTF friedrice. Damn good
"Prawn fried rice very nice, although a bit expensive. But worth it."
Finally come to woodlands

"3-Star: Overrated

4-Star: Friendly and helpful, not pushy or aggressive, really thoughtful"
Hot & yummy! The pork cutlet was tender & juicy. Waited for 20mins on a weekday night. Worth waiting!
Rice was a bit clumpy and moist. Didn't taste as good as the one at Golden Mile Centre but able to satisfy my pork chop fried rice fix.
"It has been my favorite choice as take away option.

However, today I was pretty shocked to see missing pork cutlet from my Tomyum Fried Rice Pork Cutlet. Staff should have checked their order properly.

Paid 7.80 for just fried rice "
Nice fried rice
Mei Wei De Chao Fan  Zhi De Tui Jian 
Zhu Ba Chao Fan Fei Chang Hao Chi 
Their Tom yam pork chop very nice 
"Waiting initially is long because newly opened but now it's slightly better.

Taste wise its pretty good. as good as DTF."
"Ordered Tom yum fried rice with pork cutlet. Price is reasonable $7.5 . Initial taste is nice , pork cutlet is tender too. But half way in it starts to get too salty. I think it's very strong salted and flavours . When finish the dish feels very thirsty ."
"Taste normal like tze char fried rice ~
Rather eat din tai Fung one, tried one and last
Eat at ur own risk, golden mile branch still taste slightly btr then here.."
"Only come here if you wish to get scolded by a blur yet cocky auntie. Told auntie my order and that I wanted chili. Then said I wanted to pay with CDC vouchers. She started scolding me and said I asked for CDC vouchers payment so many times already, still cannot remember CDC is accepted? I'm baffled, because this is my first time paying with CDC vouchers and I didn't even ask if it's accepted. I saw the poster saying CDC is accepted so I told her I wanted to pay with CDC. It's a statement, not a question, and yet I got wrongly scolded for her blurness.  She even complained that it's so tiring to always have to tell me cdc is accepted. I'm like ??? You tell me this for???

She then proceeded to ask me if I wanted chili, despite me already telling her I wanted it from the get-go. Then, the order came WITHOUT chili. I told her you didn't put chili, and she said if I wanted chili I should've said. I then told her I alr told her twice. I think she's too busy yapping at me rather than remembering what I actually ordered. If it's so troublesome to take people's orders or just tell your customers that CDC is accepted, why even open a noodle store in the first place? Just do yourself and this lady a favour and don't patronise this store again."
"Absolutely loved the Kolo Mee here! The noodles were perfectly cooked, with just the right texture, and the flavors were amazing. I asked for the chili to be *a little spicy* since I wanted to share it with my wife--I can handle heat, but she prefers milder food. The spice level was balanced enough for both of us to enjoy, and the dish still had that delicious kick."
"Luckily one of the long opened-stalls for me to eat. Yes, Kuching Original Kolo Mee at Marine Parade Food Centre. It was tasty (although not the same as the one at Alexandra Retail Centre)

But nevertheless, it's cheaper at the hawker centre over there and it's exactly the same as the one from Alexandra Retail Centre, based on what I ate. If I were to visit again, I will definitely go for that Kolo Mee still."
Not as tasty as some others I've tried and would have preferred if the noodles was bit more qq. But it's okay.
"A colleague from Sarawak introduced this store to me years ago and I've been hooked on it ever since. The lady boss always cooks the noodles abit firm which i feel is the best, and I feel that to make the dish even better, is to add green chilli plus abit of vinegar,  this ties the flavours together even more and helps make the noodles more moist for those who don't consume upon serving(leaving noodle to dry out).

Otherwise the timing on Google has to be changed as I've made my way here many times past 3pm to a closed store."
"Doing this review for everyone else. Not for myself.
Overpriced.  Rude."
Very good bowl of Kolo mee. Eaten there many times but still love the original flavour. I think the noodles are springy n goes v well w the chilli. Laksa also very tasty!
"Ordinary plate of kolo mee, but the chilli's pretty good"
Very nice kolo mee but must eat immediately cannot tabao or else taste won't be fresh
"04 Aug 2023: A bowl of springy noodles, well-marinated minced meat, tender char siew and all mixed with their amazing sauce...a perfect and satisfying comfort food."
"Very satisfying noodles. The sauce is subtle but tasty, and the char siew's lean but still juicy."
"Huan Bu Cuo. 

Not bad. Go for the Original KuChing Kolo Mee. Select medium size ($5.00)"
"Just a 2 star, didn't really like it.. Average tasting kolo mee.. ordered the $5 original.. mee is abit al dente, still firm when bite on.."
Got the black sauce kolo mee twice and both taste it was great. Chili on it is nice too
"Have tried multiple items at this stall, overall a really good stall with several dishes.

1) Original Kolo Mee : Nice mee, with minced meat and chilli. Blends really well.

2) Curry Chicken noodle : Extremely good chicken curry. Also, the amount of ingredients for the price are worth it.

3) Char siew Kolo Mee : Loved this dish, though I felt the quantity is a bit less. Spice levels are perfect. When you mix the char siew oil together with the noodles, it adds a nice zing overall. Soft slices of pork added in too. Shiok!"
"Nice kolo mee! I tried the original version. Chilli is quite spicy with a hint of sour. Takeaway box requires top-up of 30 cents, otherwise it's free if you opt for plastic packaging."
One of the best kolo mee in sg
The original was appetising and flavourful. Must get the chili! Was open on CNY Day 2.
Finally i got chance to try this kolo mee. There was queue around 5 people in front and people kept queueing at my back. I ordered kolo mee char siu sauce $4.5 The chili is a must. I love it. Springy noodle and tasty char siu. Recommended.
Delicious and authentic kolo mee. Taste exactly like the ones in Sarawak. Seems like many people have never tried authentic ones before
"Strange minced meat taste... seems to have some vinegar in the braise that doesn't match kolo mee. Very little, paper thin char siew. Picture showed veg for $4.50 but that wasn't included in the meal. Chilli doesn't go well with the noodles. Not even a small bowl of soup to wash down the noodles."
Very rude woman server. I cancelled my order.
"Rather disappointing and tasteless kolo mee. Lacked punch and ingredients, and didn't even taste anything like kolo mee.

Possibly the worst kolo mee that I have eaten.

Definitely not worth a 2nd visit ."
Liked the texture of the noodles. Somehow felt that the chilli given didn't go too well with the noodles.
"I wanted Kolo Mee for my last meal before Phase 2 and frankly I'm disappointed with their version. Apart from the noodle that's pretty decent, there was hardly any toppings/ ingredients. Only a few sad looking pieces of char siew. Definitely not worth it. Don't waste your time / calories here."
Personally feel its the familiar taste we had back in Kuching. Worth trying
Waited so long for the water to heat up to cook the noodles. Gave me chilli even though I told her no chilli. No soup provided. Won't order again
Char siew was tasty. Noodles were kind of al-dente. Minced meat was more like floss but still good. It's just a different kind of noodles.
"Sarawak Kolo Mee's taste are not quite right. Minced meat is mummified. Quite disappointed. Hopefully, the stall can improve as the authentic Kolo Mee is so good!"
"Delicious bowl of kolo mee. Springy noodles coated in tasty sauce, topped with minced meat, charsiew and spring onions. A marriage of wonderful flavours. They also have other items on their menu such as laksa, kolo mee with black sauce and more. Always add noodles because its just so great. Yummy!"
Awesome food but a bit pricey
Very tender and lean duck with succulent rice cooked in braised sauce and comes with braised soup at affordable prices. Worth the try and tastes really good.
"Frequent this stall for their Charsiew pork rice. However, the stall uncle was rude to me when taking my order which made me think if I should continue patronising this stall after the incident."
"Marine parade hawker again!

Kun ji duck rice is good. They have the roasted and the braised version and since the roasted drum has been sold out, i decided on the braised meat which is good too.

#duckrice"
Really delicious roasted duck rice! Always juicy and tasty.
Nice roasted duck and char siew rice
"Tried the braised duck rice and it was amazing! The duck meat was tender and juicy, and the gravy was rich and flavourful - perfect with the rice. The chilli really packed a punch - super shiok! Definitely worth a try if you're a fan of duck rice. Will be back for more!"
"Pretty legit duck rice, would have preferred the braised version but it wasn't ready at 10+am.

Get the chilli, both versions are great."
THE stall to visit if you're coming to the hawker.
Ordered the roast duck rice and the portions were good enough for $5. Not to mention its boneless!! Super tasty. Though after a while find its actually quite salty. Nonetheless a satisfying meal if you're here!
"Super tasty number 1 duck in Singapore !
Highly recommend, will give 10/10 . Everything is perfect. Boss is friendly and kind. "
"Queued 20 mins for the signature braised duck and char siew for $7.00

Didn't like the lean char siew, it was dry and chewy. Duck also not better than You Ji

Summary, over hyped."
"Tried their roasted duck leg rice. Price is fair $7 duck leg rice + $3 extra duck pieces, but taste fail...
The duck not juicy and the skin no taste as good."
"Can recommend this one easily. This is quintessential hawker food, nothing fancy just a few items done really well. Fast and efficient service serving the community. 5/5"
Decides to try after seeing the foodking sticker. Ordered braised duck rice and was disappointed. Rice and the meat is dry and not enough gravy. The portion is quite substantial and that is the only good part.
"I ordered the roast duck and with roast porkchop and braised egg.

I reached Kun Ji around 10am hoping to try their famous braised duck, but it wasn't ready yet. Ended up ordering the roast duck instead, and WOW, it did NOT disappoint.

The roast duck was roasted to perfection--the skin was crispy and full of flavor, and the meat was tender and juicy. The smoky flavor from the roast really came through, and the sauce they give with it is very appetising! It's rich and savory, with just a hint of sweetness, and it goes perfectly with the fluffy rice.

Roast pork and braised egg was good as well but nothing to shout about.

Will definitely be coming back another time to try their braised duck!"
"Large serving of rice

Braised rice was very flavourful

Decently spicy chilli"
Average hawker duck rice. moderate 15min queue. Ordered both roasted and braised duck rice but both ducks were a lil dry when we ate it (maybe it's because we came at 130pm and the ducks were out very long?) Soup was nice though
"Que very long to order, when ordering the stall worker ask want white rice or dark rice. i dont know so i try to ask, he dont even entertain and straight give me white rice. the food is ok but service overall is bad experience."
"I ordered a whole braised duck (deboned) for takeaway. Initially, I was concerned about the meat looking dry as they chopped it, but it was actually perfectly moist. Although the duck meat itself was good, the chilli sauce and chilli paste were even better - they really elevated the overall flavour.
I jokingly asked with the stall owner about why gizzards weren't included with the whole duck. Nevertheless, I purchased the gizzards and tau pok (nicely braised with no unpleasant odour) separately, and they were standout additions."
comfort food and not salty
"Got the Duck and Char Siew Rice, thought it was just alright."
"Really love the braised duck here. Also like the soft fluffy rice cooked just right amount of moisture. The taste has remained the same over the years, though expected that the prices have gone up a bit. Overall still reasonable and that's why there is a perpetual queue here."
Braised duck meat is too dry. Forgot to add gravy too.
"This is one of our favourite duck rice stalls in town and there's always a long queue here and so be prepared to queue for at least 20~30mins.

The famous item from the stall is the roast duck rice. Not only the portion is huge and generous, the meat is fragrant and very yummy. Well marinated and roasted to perfection. They have herbal soup that's nice too and have two kinds of chilli sauces to go along with the duck rice. Spicy and shiok!

They also have charsiew and roasted pork too, nice too but stil prefer their roast duck most.

In addition, they also have braised duck too. Also very nice and usually we will take away braised duck rice (while eating the roast duck rice on the spot) and with duck necks and heads and the stallowner would also pack for us additional gravy to go along with the rice and duck necks.

Although prices have gone up over the years, it is still very worthwhile considering the portion and yummy food!

Recommended."
"One of the established stalls inside Marine Parade food centre. This stall has been around for quite some time. Always notice a long queue whenever I pass by. Happen to be around the area for lunch and decided to give this stall a try since the queue was rather short. I didn't had to wait long before it was my turn to order. Apart from braised duck, they also sell roast duck and roast pork and other sides like braised egg, tau pok, tua kwa and even mui cai.

I ordered their braised duck rice, which was sgd$4.50. My plate of duck rice came with a bowl of soup that is not bad, with a mild herbal taste to it. The rice itself was not bad. Sadly, the duck was a little tough for my liking. Another thing that really stands out was the chili which was spicy and tangy as it helps to cut through the richness of the meat.

Overall, the food was alright but nothing spectacular for me. I have tried better braised duck rice elsewhere."
"My ordered 3 packets of food.
2 braised duck rice
- 1 big packet suppose to have added egg no egg
- 1 normal packet suppose to add egg and tau kua  but no added egg and tau kua....
1 char siew + roast pork rice

Total cost $16.30... with missing ingredients even after paying...."
Our go to place for excellent duck rice in Marine Parade.  Always good but the queues are always long so better go prepared.
"Too hot to sit in the hawker to eat so we decided to pack back . The roast duck was better compare to their famous braised duck. The roast duck was juicy with crispy skin well marinated taste good on its own while the braised duck was a disappointment . Very dry and tough today. The braised side items like tofu , egg and salted veg (Mei Cai) was good . Their roast pork was very crispy and nicely flavoured. The soya rice was nice . Overall I think I will go back for the roast duck and pork."
"Best roast duck rice IMO.
Friendly lady boss also keeps me coming back. "
"First time trying this stall. Was attracted to the variety of items on sale. There was roast duck, braised duck, roast pork belly char siew, duck gizzards, mei cai, braised peanuts, tau pok, tau kwa, egg and mei cai (preserved vegetables).

The price is very reasonable too, especially since the servings are generous! I ordered braised duck with roasted pork belly and added mei cai and a tau pok. Came with a tasty soup that soothed and cleared the palates for the next mouthful. It cost me $7.50. The chilli with lime was appetising and complemented the dishes well. The roast pork belly was a standout! Didn't expect much, but the skin was so crispy, and the fats oozed out. Will recommend!

There is a perpetual queue, but it moves fast as the guys preparing the meats and the lady serving are organised. Do come and support!"
"This has been my to-go-to braised duck stall ever since I discovered this about a decade ago. Had tried all their meats previously and the best is still their braised duck.

Decided to ta bao braised duck rice from Kun Ji at Marine Parade Central Hawker Centre and though I arrived at 10.50am on Sunday 2 July 2023, the signboard lights were not switched on yet but the stallowners were busy inside chopping etc.

Had brought along my trusty large round microwaveable container and when I ordered, was informed the braised rice wasn't ready yet and if I was ok with white rice instead. Inquired how long more will it take and the lady stallowner who was chopping the meat told the elderly order taking uncle to tell me to come back later for my order. After buying a couple of stuff from other stalls, came back and collected my order.

Ate this about an hour later and was surprised the portion was quite a lot vs if I had used their styrofoam box. Had requested for breast meat and no chili. It's been a while since I last had their braised duck rice and am glad it's taste as delicious as before.

Finished this in 12 minutes ."
"Had the roast pork rice today for lunch($4). The meat was crispy and tender, comes with a bowl of soup too. It's not too fatty, just the way i like it.
Overall, it's one of the better roast pork i have had.
There seems to always have a queue (it moves quick) as it's good and value for money!"
"Hao Chi De Shao Ya Fan,Huan You Fu Yi Wan Hao He De Tang,Ya Rou Hen Nen You Xiang,Fei Chang Xi Huan "
"Normally there is a queue here and the waiting time is around 10-20 minutes. The duck rice is tasty and meat is tender. The sauces go well with the duck too. I also noticed that they put duck meat on the soup, so the soup is tasty.

Apart from duck meat, they also serve roasted pork and char siew as well. There are also topping options available as an add on."
"Problem with this stall, unable to clear customers fast, hence the queue. They may speed things up by having the person taking orders and collecting the $ to also scoop the rice while one person chop all the meats."

"There's always a queue, but it's worth it! Friendly auntie helming the chopping. Braised duck rice is my fav."
"First time trying this out as today queue was shorter due to rain. Still have to queue for at least 10mins before being served. $4 for a simple duck rice without egg or braised tofu, good portion size. The rice is lightly browned with soya sauce, not over powering. Duck meat is slightly on the drier side but the sauce nicely balance it. Soup has a herbal taste and chilli has a nice tangy taste that brings out the dish. Personally I did skip the sambal chilli as it doesn't gel too well, go for the watery chilli lime for dipping. Do watch out for residual duck bone as you do not want to bite into it & end up breaking a tooth 
Will try other dish next time."
"Duck Rice (SGD $4.60) @ Kun Ji Duck Rice.
.
Among the most popular stalls attracting the longest queues, this brand specialises in duck - both braised and roasted.
.
Their braised duck has a mix of thin and thick slices, each with a silver of succulent fat, tender and moist with deep herbal earthy meaty salty savoury flavour.
.
Served over sticky yam rice with chunks of soft yam / taro, and lovely grainy earthy sweet salty flavours from the rice infused with braising gravy.
.
Their roast duck is sliced thick and chunky, yet has a pleasant tender juicy chew with a slight crispy skin, and deep smoky meaty savoury sweet flavour.
.
Served over fluffy white rice drenched in a thick gravy, lending bold herbal savoury sweet salty notes.
.
Sliced cucumbers with vegetal sweet flavour, and a light broth with sweet savoury herbal earthy notes accompany. Also added egg and tofu bean curd puffs, shiok."
"Saw a que for this stall. Decided to have my lunch here. Many braised sides to add...
I order a duck and char siew rice...
The duck, they roast until quite soft.
The char siew is OK...

Their gravy is a bit light.. not those sticky gravy....
I think their items goes more with... Lu, items...
Maybe because of the crowd..

Food is good for my liking..
Will drop by again if I am nearby."
"The rice was well cooked, roast pork and duck was decent. Generous portions."
The name is a misnomer. This stall serves more than duck. The char siew and the roasted pork are nice. It is one of the few signature stalls at Marine Parade hawker center. The lunch time queue is insane. Be prepared to wait at least 20 minutes before you can be served. I ordered the char siew rice. The price is reasonable considering the inflationary pressure facing the hawkers. The char siew is good. The sauce is also good although there is a tinge of herbs in rye sauce. Overall the experience is good. The downside is of course the long wait. I saw the ducks being ordered on a regular basis. The roasted pork looks deliciously inviting. Check them out if you are in the neighborhood.
"Forget the duck. Did they name the shop wrongly? Maybe it was meant to be Kun Ji Roast Meats? Just whack the char siew and roast pork. Shiok.

I removed 2 stars for inconsistency during my return visit. Last time you gave me chunks of char siew and now you give me paper thin slices where all of it put together can equal 1 piece last time. FAIL! What's up with you guys? And because of your inconsistency, I will not be back.

Well I came back and tried again. Still inconsistent but better. My first visit was the best."
Delicious tasty roasted & braised duck rice and duck porridge.
"one of my 2 favorite duck rice, and great family too"
Decent braised duck rice. $3.50 + $0.50 for egg. Good portion as takeaway. The dry sambal chilli is really secretly packing a spicy punch!
"Ordered two (2) packets of the $3.50 Roasted duck rice set for takeaway, as the braised duck was not ready when we dropped by at around 10.30am.

Generous duck and rice portions for $3.50. However, the roasted duck meat is a tag DRY to our liking. Strangely one pack comes without the skin (skinless duck) !!

Verdict:

maybe the braised duck taste better as per other reviews ?"
Decent plate of char siew and roast duck rice. Duck was slightly dry. Char Siew good balance of meat to fat ratio. The chilli was nice. The soup was nice too because mostly duck rice no soup one. Overall nice but not fantastic
Been visiting this stall in 84 Marine Parade Central since 2012. Delicious food with reasonable price.
"In my opinion . I think it's a little too dry ...could be due to take away ...then again Queue was long but fast moving and daughter of the owner was polite and smiles to everyone placing their orders.

I think by asking if the customer like sauce on the side would be good in the near future.

My all time favourite braised duck in the east is still east coast lagoon food centre stall  ..it's beside the curry puff near the beef noodles stall .

It's always long queue during peak hours as well ."
"Divine. Very generous portions of food. Braised duck rice with char siew and braised peanuts for only $5.50. The meats were all very succulent with an exceptional marinade. The braised peanuts were perfectly executed - not braised till they were too mushy and retained a good bite. Just the right amount of sauce. The soup was mildly herbal and good too.

There's always a queue for this stall but it moves quite fast. Do also note that they usually sell out by 5pm+ so don't expect to come here for dinner.

Highly recommended. Will return."
"Generous portions indeed!

We're gravy people and they were generous with it! 

Had Char Siew, Xio Bak and Roast Duck Platter with Mei Cai and yam rice.

Pleasant meal at affordable price. Oh, I must add, helpful too. Ordered a little too much and no grumbles helping me pack the left overs 

As for the tray, you get your 50cents back when you return it. Think NTUC shopping cart "
Minus 1 star for stale chilli and overdose of MSG
"Honestly it's not fantastic but it's not bad either. I notice most reviews were that it's value money. Ordered a $10 platter with roasted pork, char siew and roasted duck with photo attached. First time visit there."
"Braised duck + liver at $4 is definitely a steal for hungry stomachs. Portion is very generous and service is nice. Selection is huge - roast duck, roast pork, char siew, braised duck, parts, etc. For foodies, duck is only ok in terms of taste. But young ravenous chaps looking for choice and big servings will probably be quite happy here."
"Hao Chi ,Zhi De. Ya Mi"
"This store serves excellent braised duck meat along with their crispy roasted pork belly and char siew. Best to order and eat on the spot. I packed one extra pkt home in less than 20 minutes for a family member, and it tasted totally different. Awesome food that hits the spot!"
Reasonable quality and very generous portion.
All time favourite stall ... Love their duck and charsiew
Regular customer here. Generous portion of braised duck for $3.50. Their duck porridge is good too. The line tends to be long but it moves quickly. Tbh not the best duck rice around but its popularity speaks for itself & it doesn't need my review.
The roasted duck is ok but the soup is very tasty.
Kun Ji - Roasted Duck & Char Siew portion is large ($5 per packet )
"braised duck soft to bite and tasty., rice is soft and flavourful. generous portion, good value meal."
"A bit too salty for my taste, but not bad."
Love the generous portion of the duck rice. Their roast pork belly is a must try
"The roasted duck rice + additional cost me $5. Well, the meat is tender and juicy, but definitely not the tastiest duck rice in Singapore. The reasons why I'm not giving 4 stars or above were: 1) long que, I waited for around 10 mins, 2) need to pay additional $0.50 for using the tray"
"Food is not bad. Although there was queue, service as very fast. Had the duck and char siew rice."
One of the best roasted duck and meats in the area
Nice char siew and roasted meat rice.
Very nice roasted duck and char siew rice.
"This is a stall that I just chance upon as I was running some errands. The shop is easy to find facing outside of the market, not hidden inside the market. The lady was quick to respond, and I asked for no pork. She lamented a short while, then agreed to give me what I wanted.
This is NOT the usual fishball meepok dry, it leans more to the bak chor mee. The noodle is overcooked, as I prefer a stiffer noodle. The chilli paste is robust, with the addition of shallots (as I've said, this is not the original taste). The soup taste rich, and it has Tang Chye in it, which is not commong nowadays.
The fishball is unique as it has chill and spring onions in it and it taste wonderful! Suculent enough, leans to the softer side. You can taste the chilli and spring onions in it! I would say the fish cake is sliced too thin, so it lacks firmness. The key to fish items is the bounciness and the tautness of its flesh. This is the rule that canot be broken.
I give this stall a rating of 3.7, not reaching 4 out of 5. It would have been a 5 if the noodle is firmer, and it is served without shallots because it changes the original taste. I do think that with a bit more mastery on the noodle making it ""cleaner and simpler"" taste, which is easy to do, this stall can shine. BTW they have strong supporters, especially those that love the Bak Chor."
I Tried their mee kia. The noodles are not overcooked and comes with the Nice alkali fragrance. Very old school taste. $4 and Good portion of noodles. They have paylah!
I love the fishball noodle from this stall. Very delicious! One of the best fishball noodle in Marsiling/Woodlands area. Lady boss and her mum very friendly too! Highly recommended to all.
"Love their soup, i eat it since i am young. Friendly lady boss who always welcome me with SMILE"
This fishball noodle from this stall is very nice and delicious. I would eat it on the days they are open. Both the lady boss and her mum is very friendly and nice. This stall is highly recommended to all to try out.
"I love the fishball noodle from this stall, even my spouse also love it. Very nice! I can eat this stall noodle on the days when they are open. One of the best fishball noodle in Marsiling/Woodlands area. Lady boss and her mum very friendly too! Highly recommended to all."

"Yummy delicious fish balls noodles
Must eat in Marsiling market
Friendly auntie and daughter man's the stall"
Love the fishball noodles!Request for white version and lady Boss is very obliging able to make special order for me!
One the best fishball noodle in marsiling &woodlands.friendly lady boss
"Sauce a bit sweet probably due to chilli. Dislike 1/5.
Noodle well cook 4/5.
Fishball is bouncy and taste ok 3/5.
Overall average."
"Affordable, healthy. Always long queue. Popular with the local residents."
"There is always a long queue, but the soup base is really delicious."
Hardly can find S$3.50 prawn noddles after covid period. Old school taste.
"Quality definitely outweighs the price point. On top of that, the soup is flavourful and doesn't leave you thirsty after that. Highly recommended if you're in the north. Usually sold out by 10pm+"
"Very nice prawn noodles at really reasonable price. The broth is tasty and I don't get that thirsty feeling after the whole bowl of it. The pork cubes is very tender and the noodles are springy. Comes with an assortment of chilli powder to give that extra oomph. 90% of customers goes for the soup version. Not sure if there is a dry version. Each bowl is meticulously prepared thus expect a long waiting time - 30-45 mins usually.
Overall nice stall owners who seem to enjoy dishing out good food for value."
"One bowl of prawn mee from this store cost just $3.50 for 4 prawns, countless fish cake and meat with noodles and supreme soup covered with fried oil onions. It's no wonder that we queue for close to half an hour for it's wonderful prawn noodles!"
"The stall opens at 7:30am., but the line begins earlier and always sold out around 10:30am. Don't expect the same flavor as Malaysia's Penang Prawn Noodle, but it's still tasty. The small packet costs S$3.50, while the large one costs S$4.00."
The queue is self explanatory. Look at the age of customers in the queue. If you are young may be you cannot appreciate it. They don't sell dry version. Parking is crazy at peak hours
Wonder why there's a long queue.  Wait 30mins for a MSG soup prawn noodles. The prawns served are not fresh at all. Anyone keen on MSG this is the place to be.
"I ordered a large bowl of their noodles ($6 as at Nov 2022) and was asked if I wanted more ingredients or noodles and if I wanted extra soup. Lo and behold, I was shocked when they handed me this extremely large soup bowl. Boy was I glad to have wanted the extra soup.

The soup is really the soul of this dish. This is the second best prawn soup I have ever tasted but way more affordable than my number 1. The prawns were also fresh and whole, albeit a little small, but at this price, one shouldn't be complaining.

If you like prawn noodles, please come down and give this a try!"
Good prawn broth . Delicious and addictive. Uses fresh prawn . Value for money @ $4 a bowl. Be prepare to wait for 30 mins
"Was recommended to try this prawn noodles stall.
Noodles are well cooked. Soup definitely tasty and aromatic. Generous amount of ingredients at a reasonable price. They give pork belly meat instead of the usual lean meat. They also provide red chilli powder and pork lard too.
Be prepared to queue for it. I waited at least 20 plus minutes. Try go early, heard they can sold out in 3hrs.
Highly recommended."
"Good comfort food 
Long queue and long waiting wear you out further "
Not worth a the long queue for a taste so so prawn noodle. Attitude is good.
Take ages to cook.
My favourite Prawn Noodle. Although the queue is Long but it's all worthy. The portion is very generous ( Normal size - $3.00 ) and if you keen for the challenge can order the large bowl ($3.50) and sure it can last you till dinner. Give it a try if you have not eaten before.
"Very long queue as usual. By 10am, everything sold out."
10 years ago this stall offers dried prawn noodle version. Can't describe to you how delicious the dried version was. The scallion oil and the abalone sauce such great combination and freshness of the prawn. The soup version is good but definitely can't beat the dried version. The stall doesn't offer the dried version anymore which is such a shame. The taste is just going to disappear like that. Maybe abalone sauce cost is too pricey to make a profit? The quene is still long for the die hard followers who loves the soup version. The soup I bet has a lot of MSG because it taste good and sweet too. They do use pork in their soup base. The noodle usually sell out fast on weekends and usually by noon they will close up. The other amazing thing about this stall is they will place a box of tissue and I notice customers who don't have the habit of bringing their tissue or handky will usually help themselves to it after their meal. Marsiling court is located near the elderly estate and more elderly people frequent there. There is a multi carpark which is only 5 mins walk to the hawker center and wet market the other open carpark is usually full most of the time.
Stayed here for 6 years and just a stone throw away. Tried this prawn noodles once and don't understand why the queue is so long.
Came here many times and always need to queue. A minimum of 30minutes waiting time. Love their soup base! Solid! Highly recommended!
Best prawn noodles at woodlands! Have to queue all the time. Expecting to wait around 30-70min.The stall located near POSB ATM. Open from around 730am and it sold out within few hours. All time fav!
All time favourite 
"Asked for no pork repeatedly.

Lam's staff: adds minced pork, sliced pork, pork meatball"
"Service is quite slow. Queued about 20 min although there were only 4-5 people ahead of me. Did a takeaway and ate it within 15 minutes of leaving the stall - the noodles were stuffed into a small compartment in the takeaway box, they were completely dry halfway through by then and all clumped together. Salt-baked chicken was salty on the outside and tasteless on the inside. Requested no chilli but the bottom half of the noodles were coated in chilli. Overall, not impressed (or even satisfied) and won't visit again."
"Ordered salt bake chicken with rice (no 15) today for lunch at the Parkway foodcourt. Was surprised the rice is very different from pre-renovation. The taste of the rice was too over powering that I couldn't taste much of the chicken & my favourite chilli.
Quite disappointed. Serving of rice was too much.
The young man (shorter one) serving was pleasant & patient."
Please support other stalls instead. They charge additional for chilli and my noodle is cold because I refuse to buy chilli.
it's finally backed. thought it was gone for good because of the change in management but it's back. the great chicken with the great taste.
Standard drop a lot. Taste more like junk food now.
Xin Cai Se Da Bai Gu Rou Cuo Mian Hao Chi!
"Everytime I visit Parkway Parade Foodcourt, this is the noodle that I always order."
What can I say? Lam's never disappoints. Got their salt baked chicken thigh & signature mee kia. Flavours been consistently good like all the other branches I've been too and it was such a hearty meal.
"Very disappointed with the service and attitude with the 2 staff. (Cashier and cooker)

Was queueing for the noodle when me and family saw the cashier wasn't having a good attitude toward all customers during the situation. When it is our turn to collect the noodle the cooker don't even bother to ask we need a separate soup for our dry noodle just waiting for us to go so he can cook another bowl.

Will not visiting this outlet/branch again. Management please look into it."
First time trying this Lam's Baked Salted Chicken with Spaghetti. Food was average. Service is super appalling! Ordered at cashier and staff simply was not interested in serving. Food ready next counter (while I was still waiting at cashier Lam's noodles side) and the staff did not even bother to inform me! Note: this was at 6:40pm and NO QUEUE AT ALL!!!
Taste good!
"Ah Lam's salted baked chicken is delicious! Yummy, unique and special.

Recommend to come try!"
Good and tasty soup and the meat are tenderly delicious.
"Horrible taste. Can tell both men have zero interest in making the dish. Stay away, just drop by the Marine Central food centre for a better bowl of noodles. 0 QC."
Their special noodles is really good and reasonably priced. Not much ingredients though.
Food is delicious and service is fast
"Came at 1110am on a Sunday (28/07/24) and was told the chicken thighs were sold out.
I find that highly ridiculous/unbelievable as it's not even lunch time!
They told me only have pieces of chicken but no more thighs.

Then how are you going to sell your chicken thigh with rice set from 1110am onwards till dinner time?
Or do I have to buy the whole chicken?

If you explain nicely and say you cannot sell so many chicken thighs without the rice set if not you will have a lot of remaining rice, I would have accepted and buy the set.

To give the reason no more chicken thighs at that timing, I feel very doubtful.

Will never patronise this outlet again.
I'm sure there are other salt baked chicken out there."
"The best salt baked chicken in Singapore, kids love it!"
"Came to this outlet (parkway parade) as we had a good experience at another outlet (causewaypoint). Long story short, food was pretty good, but the service was horrendous.

We visited this shop around 630pm on 16th July 2024, a Tuesday evening and it was pretty empty. We arrived at the store and were deciding on what to get. Spoke to the 2 male chinese staff running the store as referenced in one of the previous posts. I was clarifying the vegetables used in their mini hotpot and they replied in Chinese a few times. My Mandarin isn't great and I was trying my best to understand what he was saying. After about 3 exchanges, he moved away and laughed to himself.

I proceeded to place an order with the cashier and he left mid order to prepare the first order. After that he asked for payment and I had to tell him I wanted to order more. He sighed and took my order anyways. After moving over to prepare the second order, he and the first guy were laughing whilst looking over. Granted they could have been talking and laughing about anything else, but it felt at that moment, as they were glancing over, that it was potentially about my poor Mandarin.

As we were collecting our food, we had the trays right at the entrance, he prepared the mini hot pot and left it beside the tray while rudely pointing and gesturing for us to put it on the tray ourselves. At that point we were done and just wanted to take our food and leave.

Overall, any of these incidences in isolation wouldn't have necessarily pushed me to drop a review. However it was all these factors combined with the unprofessionalism, condescending and rude attitude of these 2 staff, that led me to post this.

I sincerely hope that the management would kindly look into grooming their staff to conduct themselves professionally and with respect towards their customers."
"Soliciting review but cashier guy said ""don't have"" without explanation. I suggested they should remove the side. No reply. "
"The staffs attitude needs improvement. I am a frequent customer and experience same rude, arrogant and unfriendly service not once but most of the time. The stall is not crowded either when I was there.

They cannot take simple request. To give an example, I request to exclude vegetables from my noodle. They grumble and make nasty comments.

Also the salted chicken used to juicy and fresh. Recent times it has gotten inferior. Wonder if it is not fresh or change of supplier. Texture is dry, taste is only on chicken skin and not the meat itself. Such a pity.

I would appreciate the management to look into this. Be grateful to all your customer. Being polite doesn't cost you anything.

My latest encounter with the 2 male staff is on 13-July about 12:50pm."
"Visited on 27.1.24@1830hrs. Food is nice! Had fine noodle and is very Q. However, it's a pity it came with unfriendly staff & poor attitude who was taking my order."
"Used to be juicy and tasty.

Now, it's dry and the taste not worthy of the brand."
Love the lams bake chicken with wedges at parkway foodcourt! My go to!
Decent service and good food
The rice that comes with the salt baked chicken is not edible.. hard as rock!
Lam's noodle is always one of my favorite in Parkway Parade food court. The service has been improved since the last time I had an unpleasant issue. The sauce with the noodles was flavorful. The soup is always fantastic.
"Since after CNY, standard had dropped for the dried noodles. Previously the fishballs were refried, you can see from the darker color of the fish balls and the taste was really good. It's really a signature dish to eat and this has become my usual lunch whenever I visit my in-laws.
However after CNY, the fishballs were no more refried, the man preparing the noodles just poured the fishballs from the plastic bag into the boiling hot water and scooped out to serve.
Lams replied my review claiming fried fishballs are not healthy as reason for doing away with it.
But surprisingly, a few weeks later, I saw refried fishballs again being served."
"Hen Xi Huan Zhe Li,Xiao Ge Tai Du Hao. Mian Hao Chi Chi Liao Hao Duo Ci. Ji Tui Fan Ye Hen Bang. Zhi De Tui Jian"
"I am absolutely furious about the appalling treatment my mother and i received at this establishment. The staff were rude, impatient, and outright disrespectful.

Instead of assisting my mum with finding the QR code for payment, he just stood there for a solid 30 seconds staring blankly until my mum asked where the QR code was, then proceeded to scold her in a rude tone, stating, ""There's no QR code lah, paywave only,"" while another coworker on the side was snickering at us.

The same worker that scolded my mum still had the guts to shout at me with a rude ""HELLO x3"" while waving the receipt in my face.

2 stars for the nice uncle on the side, for prepping the meal fast! I understand that there are just a few bad apples that ruin the experience for customers.
But seriously, we're not asking for five-star treatment here. The least they can do is treat us with some common decency."
Ate the lams specialty noodles. Pangsai for 2 days
Fresh bowl of yummy noodles ! Chilli is good and noodles are just right and springy
Good salt baked chicken.. the mee was very average...
"I was upset & want to give ZERO STAR. The PRC lady cashier was super rude, she is not fit to be in the service line. After payment, did not politely tell customers to move aside n suddenly yelled at me loudly to move behind where there is plenty of space to take orders. FYI, the person behind me was still talking & not ready to make any orders. When questioned her for her horrible attitude, she was argumentative &  not apologetic at all. It is a basic service to tell patrons after payment with a smile & not commanding your customers like we owe you!!! Apology is needed."
Not as good as before and more ex
Taste good
Simply the best. Yummy food at wallet friendly prices
"great noodles, meatballs were nice, food was served quickly"
"I like the chilli that comes with the baked chicken. Chicken is tender goes well with the mixed rice ,which is yam rice I think."
Have been ordering the Lam baked chicken for many years and enjoyed it very much. My family love the noodles with spinach fish ball soup. Healthy and yummy. Will recommend to anyone wanting a hearty meal.
"The last time I was here was two weeks ago. This time I came to buy their chicken. Because I want to buy it for my husband's birthday. Very tasty. I bought two, ate one myself, and took one home. The chicken is very delicious when eaten on site. It wasn't as amazing the day after I took it home, but it was still delicious. I hope more new products will continue to surprise me."
"One of our favorite noodles joint but unfortunately the review is marred by the horrendous service received today .

We placed an order for 2 specialty noodles , 1 Kway teow and 1 mee pok. Upon seeing we received 2 Kway teow , we went back to ask for a corrected order only to be berated by the cashier ( young chap with mask , the taller one of the 2 on duty). He scolded us for confirming it was 2 Kway teow when the question was '2 no. 1 option', and when we said it's not correct , he went on to blast us for playing on the phone during order taking when we were making payment via ShopBack pay.

The encounter totally destroyed the experience and quality of Lam's noodles . If this is the kind of cashier you plant at your stall then I'd highly recommend you to change it to self pay machine , rather than have someone there pick up the wrong order and end up shouting at customers for his own mistakes .

Pls kindly refer to the receipt timing and address the particular staff on duty ."
Nice noodles everytime
The fish balls is extremely nice.
"Had the signature Lam's noodle and I must say, it's rather delicious. The noodle is cooked to perfection, aka Al Dente and goes very well with the chili sauce. The best for me is the fried fishball; good texture, fried but very soft and moist inside."
"Noodles were good as usual.
Soup was piping hot and tasty.
Good atmosphere for foodcourt at 4pm."
Tried their salted chicken and it taste yummy...
Great noodles!
"Some 2 months or so ago, Lam's noodle replied my earlier review of stopping the serving of fried fishballs citing for health reason. But recently, fried fishballs were served again. This is interesting."
"2 / 5 Stars

Very disappointed in the taste. Felt that the chicken was not well marinated. Instead of Salt baked chicken, I would say this is just baked chicken.

Base on my memory, the salt bake chicken tasted so much more flavourful and tender several years back.

However shall give some kudos to the chili sauce which tasted pretty decent."
With shop back the point system becomes not applicable. This is lousy service.
Staff is friendly and service is fast.
Love their salted chicken! My always go for dish!
Tasty and great service
My all-time go-to brunch/dunch at Parkway Parade's food court -- Lam's signature abalone noodles
Noodle was nice and meat are cooked delicious
Taste well till nothing left
"Yuan Gong Su Zhi You Dai Gai Jin,Zhan Zai Qian Mian Wu Fen Zhong Gong Ren Zhi Gu Zhao Hua Shou Ji Ye Bu Lai Zhao Dai,Deng Ren Jiao Liao Cai Hui Dong,You Wang Ji Gei Tang,Mei You Yi Qian Hao Liao"
Overcooked noodle. What's the use of the timer????
"Salted Chicken Thigh is fresh,  but I felt the taste was not like what I remembered,  not salty enough.  Boiled chicken thigh with  rice is a more appropriate name for it."
Great tasty food at reasonable price.
the dumplings soup is value for money
Always my choice!
One of our favourite mee pok noodles whenever we come to Parkway. 
"Ordered the Lam's specialty noodles ($4.80) and added the meat balls (+$1) and half an egg (+$1) so total was $6.80

Wouldn't say that it's worth it or taste exceptionally great. I would have eaten Ah Ma Chi Mian in the same foodcourt (highly recommend).

Salted baker chicken with rice ($7) was pretty pathetic, as the chicken was on the dry side and rice was quite sticky (too much water I guess?)
I could have cooked this myself and would have tasted a lot better and cheaper haha"
I enjoy the food a lot.
"Usually order their speciality noodles, love the sauce and texture of the noodles. Would recommend."
My favorite stall in food republic and one of my favorite chicken dishes of all time!
"Lam's Chicken, Add Mee Pok, Add Egg, Add Minced Meat recommended by a friend and it is eye opening!!
A very filling meal with flavor in every scoop. Salt Baked Chicken is tender "
"Located at the Republic food Court in the basement of parkway parade,  this stall was originally made famous at the outlet at race course road.
The chicken is baked in a paper parcel with herbs. Meat is very tender but I thought the flavour was a bit on the bland side. The star of the show has to be the chilli sauce. I strongly believe that it gives the chicken more kick and makes the dish complete.
Nice comfort food."
"We used to eat this noodles almost on a weekly basis as kids have classes around here. But the quality had deteriorated significantly compared to few years back. The pork slices are tough and the noodles is overcooked n kinda soggy. But they are one of the few stalls that's been around for a long time, maybe a good number of followers . Sally, it lost one today..."
Qty very little
Very nice food and good customer service.
"First time I went, no chicken!  Second time, no spaghetti!  Maybe third time will be the charm?  So I had rice instead and I have to say the rice was very moist and flavorful, as was the chicken.  The skin was deicious and the chicken had a nice flavor the whole way through.  The chili sauce was particularly excellent.  Reasonable price too."
Remember to order the mixed grain rice!
Use tingkat also ask me pay $0.50. Have boycott since.
Finally i remembered ...this is the salted chicken i ate long time ago. Super succulent and really delicious. The staff are all well-mannered although food is served in a food court. Love this and would recommend this to all my friends.
"IG: @melvineateat

8/10
$6

One of the few places left to serve taupok pau. Everything was grilled to perfection. The taupok with taugei inside, cuttlefish which was crisp and tasty, the youtiao which was also crispy on the outside . Century egg was cut in large pieces to enjoy them with each mouthful

The rojak sauce was also thick with so much savoury flavour from the shrimp paste and not too sweet

Recommend for a snack if you're around the area"
"ZESTY MIX

Tried the rojak at Dunman for the first time and it was a pleasant surprise. The mix of ingredients was fresh and well-balanced, but what really stood out was the sauce--rich, tangy, and full of umami, it tied everything together beautifully. The baked youtiao was a nice twist--crisp yet light, without feeling greasy. I especially loved the addition of century egg, which gave the dish an extra layer of flavor and creaminess. It's a bold touch that worked really well. Overall, the rojak had a great balance of textures and flavors. I'll definitely be back for more. If you're in the area and craving something local and satisfying, this is a solid choice."
Best rojak in the east. Must try!
"traditional meets artisan, with smoky, fresh, flavour-packed components that come together in an umami-rich sauce you won't forget."
"Best Rojak in Singapore -- and some say Batam & Malaysia too! 

I've been patronizing Lau Hong Ser Rojak since the 90s, and its taste and quality have remained wonderfully consistent. The you tiao and tau pok is grilled for that perfect smoky crunch and the sauce is thick, flavourful and packed with umami...just the way it always has been. Topped with a generous layer of crushed peanuts, every bite is a nostalgic treat.

Uncle works at his own pace, so be prepared for a wait...or better yet, call ahead to order and beat the queue! This old school gem truly stands the test of time.

P/S - The steamed fish and BBQ chicken wings at nearby stalls are must tries too!"
"Dropped by Lau Hong Ser and ordered their classic set with you tiao, tau pok, cuttlefish, and century egg -- and wah, really power! 

Everything was freshly prepared and coated with their signature thick, flavourful prawn paste sauce. Old-school taste that's getting rare these days! 

Massive respect to the uncle running the stall  -- his dedication and consistency truly deserve a salute.

If you're into traditional-style rojak with all the savoury goodness, this is a must-try. Confirm Jin Ho Jiak! "
"Very nice rojak,yummy"
Good stuff!! Rating : 5/5.
Very tasty old time favourite...
"The thick and intense flavour, shrimp paste a.k.a. 'Hei Gor' was so addictive & yummy, I even waited for an additional 45mins to takeaway two packets after having my fill on the spot! "
"My family have been very regular customers for many years. The
owner recognised and remembered his regulars well. He has very good memories of his customers preference too. My family always enjoyed Lau Hong Ser Rojak. It is one of the best rojak so far. Do try the rojak if you have not. You'll enjoy it."
"Highly recommend! Thus far the best rojak I had in Singapore.

I went during dinner time which is quite crowded and waited for 15 mins. But well-worth the wait as the rojak is nicely made, thick sauce that is seasoned with sweetness and a bit of spiciness. The you-tiao is roasted with crispness that adds a layer of textures, along with the pineapple, cucumber, jicama and bean sprouts.

I got mine for $4, but the smallest portion available is $3."
"old school rojak since childhood days in the 80s, brings back good memories with the taste"
Not the typical soggy sauce you would expect. The shrimp paste used here is somewhat dry which is just ideal.
All times favourite rojak! Love the cuttlefish. So crispy and smell so good. Cnt stop eating. I need to add more cuttlefish. We choose set B. It has century egg and beancurd too. Their century egg is always so good. The you tiao is crunchy too. Sauce is spicy too.
Ordered the smallest rojak $3. Today is fast with 3 pax making the rojak. Freshly made and the thick sauce with peanuts was heavenly. One of the best Rojak in Singapore hidden in a small food centre.
Best vegetarian  Rojak in Singapore
favourite best rojak in singapore. it only opens from late afternoon until wee hours. good supper or post dinner joint. come support local family business.
"Rojak was really nice! The sauce is unique and not too sweet! The cuttlefish is a bit expensive but toasted to perfection! Youtiao was solid too! Worth a try if you're adventurous! But the rojak taste different from the normal ones you find outside, but pretty good in my opinion!

The wait is horrendous though.. came at 9pm with only 5-6 people in front of me but it took like 30-40mins "
small portion
"You would not be able to taste another traditional rojak like this anywhere else.  So please make an effort to come here.  You would not regret it.  The queue could be long at times, but I know that the elderly owner is trying his best.  Try it with the dry sotong."
"Sharing this Rojak stall, jin hojiak,
Luckily, no queue, order 2 packets take away,  yummy good, love the 'hei Kor' sauce,  the sauce will not be watery when buy back "
Crispy Fried You Tiao. Straight up bussin.
Like the rojak sauce with sweet n sour taste. Thick sauce. Most items heat to crispy.
"Rojak taste is good, maybe a little sweet.
The you tiao and tau pok is crisp and absorb the prawn paste flavor well. Recommended."
"Superb Rojak sg style, even have dry styles"
One of the best rojak in the east
Undoubtedly the best rojak in Singapore and maybe even beyond! Have been supporting Uncle and family for more than a decade. Items are toasted and made fresh upon order and remains crispy even when coated with rojak sauce and taken away. Rojak sauce is well balanced in flavour and brings out the best in taste for the dish. Peanuts are also homemade which is one-of-a-kind that you can't find elsewhere. Very humble and friendly owners too. Uncle opens till late (2am) and is the best supper fix for me.
Very dull and unappetizing rojak. We don't like the prawn paste sauce here as it's not what we are used to. This stall is not for us.
"Tried this old school institution of rojak.

Very very thick and dry style of rojak. Very musky shrimp paste taste but it fell abit flat. Maybe I have sweet tooth and prefers soon heng's version more.

But legit. Ok? *"
My favourite since 2003
"Excellent Rojak...BEST Lah. Cheap too.

Uncle SUPER FRIENDLY"
"Authentic, friendly and real Singaporean fare. The amazing taste of home that can make one weep..."
This uncle has been making rojak for me since I was 6. Haven't came here in over 10 years and it still tastes as good as it did before. Really awesome
"Best Rojak in East Coast area.

Traditional style (not sweet), dried tofu beancurd and squid are nicely grilled with a hint of charcoal.

Love how owners put 100% focus and passion every time they make."
"Not a fan, too much black sauce and normal ingredients   Is ok. But very slow"
Traditional taste not too sweet
Many reviews said this is the best rojak in the eastern part of Singapore. I have to agree wholeheartedly. The magic is in the sauce. I am not sure what else is in the thick and rich rojak sauce but to me it feels like they have infused ground peanut into it as it has that aroma and taste of peanut butter. The grilled cuttlefish is so crispy that it just melts in the mouth. And the best part is that it pairs surprisingly okay with an Italian Nebbiolo wine - probably because of the high acidity and full bodied. The portions of rojak and separate plate of taupok and cuttlefish are altogether $6. Simple pleasure in life.
"I have tried a few other famous rojaks around SG so I had to give it a try when I was in the area when they are open since I would usually not be there.

The rojak lacked oomph and I think it has got to do with the prawn paste they use. It's not strong enough. The water from the bean sprouts was also making the dish soggy as you were eating it."
"So much to  about this place!

The owner is so friendly and passionate, and insisted I pay after collecting. My rojak was covered up for me to collect, which was a thoughtful gesture.

The rojak is so nicely made, and coated with this luxuriously thick sauce that's a moreish blend of salty, sweet, and spicy, and goes extremely well with the tangy pineapple, juicy radish and crispy youtiao.

So glad that I managed to try this finally, and I hope that heritage humble stalls like this will stay open and prosper!"
"Not really a fan of rojak normally but this rojak is really good. Sauce was quite thick and balanced, all the toppings are like they were meant to be there with the sauce."
"I decided to check out this stall because of the reviews on social media. I did not feel that the taste of the rojak was outstanding.  The rojak sauce is on the thicker side, and I fail to taste the lime or tamarind juice usually added to the rojak. I wouldn't recommend coming all the way here just to taste the food."
I would said: worth the wait!
Best rojak in singapore! The sauce is so flavourful and the char on the you tiao and tau pok is just amazing!
"We had the taupok pau stuffed with bean sprouts, you tiao, cuttlefish, century egg, ginger slices with prawn paste sauce (sauce served separately) and rojak.

Youtiao and taupok are freshly grilled over charcoal. Nice and crunchy. The rojak is old school basic ingredients (taupok, you tiao, turnip, pineapple, bean sprouts, cucumber). Reminds me of the rojak I had when I was a kid.

Generous topping of peanuts too!"
Best rojak in Singapore and they should be included in the Michelin Bib! Love the way the owners take pride in preparing their food and their passion speaks for itself. Great job!
"Rojak ($4 plate plus $1 for century egg and $2 for dried cuttlefish) - The sauce was thick and slightly spicy. The best part was the dried cuttlefish which was freshly grilled, thin and aromatic. The century egg was good too."
"Had the rojak + century egg ($5.00) on 29/10/22, yummy."
"Tried their 4 dollars rojak today for the first time. Sauce a bit salty, should add more sugar. Portion was small compare to that famous stall at old airport road FC. Taste wise also not as good as that stall"
"best rojak in sg. you tiao and cuttle fish are toasted over charcoal flame making it crispy outside with unique taste.

tau pok with vegetables is a must try. sauce is spicy and sweet, completes the experience. good for takeouts and bites too."
"This is the best rojak in Singapore. It's not even close.

Yes it can be pricey if you choose the works, but this is one place definitely worth the price. I have never been particularly wowed by chinese style rojak as a dish generally, but this is one stall that elevates it to another level. a must try."
"This rojak gives an out of this world experience.
Win famous Whampoa Hoover and TPY Soon Heng hands down."
This rojak is super good. Speechless. The price is reasonable and the dried sotong is reasonably priced and very good.
Best rojak in Singapore. Traditional and delicious. My advice to come during off peak hours
Amazing!!! Absolutely the best. The sauce was richly blended with peanuts and not too sweet. Dough sticks grilled to perfection.
"This has been my favourite rojak stall for awhile - the youtiao and taupok are freshly grilled and to me the highlight is the nice, thick sauce. Great for late night cravings, went past midnight, apparently opens till 1+ or 2am. Can call in advance, or check their FB"
Very nice rojak with thick sauce and char grilled ingredients. My friend appreciate the sauce and even licking it off the plate.
Best Rojak in the east. Traditions taste with good ingredients and humble stall owner.
Good food good service
one of the best Rojak in Singapore!
Best rojak in the east
"Fantastic stuff, always good to order in advance cus the queue time at peak hours can go up to an hour"
Well balanced and tasty.  Waited about 45 mins
One of the best rojak I have eaten. Now they start selling at around 4pm. They are closed for 2 days in a week (please check).
"My favourite rojak stall. Yes the wait is long, but I usually call and order beforehand, so no wait at all in the end. Uncle is the nicest. Funny and accommodating. Most important of all, the sauce for the bbq rojak is great. Hit all the right notes. And I agree with a previous review. Wanna try a bad rojak with rude service, try the East Coast Lagoon Rojak."
Still good after all these years
"One of the best rojak in town. At $6, the sizeable and impressive portion came with the usual rojak mix but it topped off with very nicely grilled and crunchy fried fritters, century eggs and crispy grilled cuttlefish.  The stall is runned by this elderly couple who looked like in their 60s. Despite their advanced age, they were so much on top of the game with customer service and managing expectations. To each of the endless streams of customers who walked in to order( with customized requests)  the aunty would tell them how much time to wait before their order n then they will decide if they should proceed with the orders. Uncle would be so busy churning out the orders but still had the time to double confirm my order of no chili and no sugar. My order came well below the expected waiting time of one hour
In fact it was only a 15 min wait. Speaking of underpromising but over delivering, this rojak stall and customer oriented owners deserves its fame n love by their customers. Wishing uncle and aunty the best of health n may the rojak stall continue to prosper , offering their best to customers for a long time"
"One of the best, if not the best Rojak in the East imo.  Can't understand why so many ppl complaining about the long wait...if there's no queue, you better dont eat, as nobody bother ordering lousy food too...the uncle always managed his customers expectations well by informing them about the waiting time...order only if you're willing to wait...it's a informed decision...there are many other good foods, normally Rojak will be my first dish to order

at least not like some stalls, just take in orders but can't churn out to serve and let you wait only...."
Best rojak
Quite nice rojak.  The sauce was delicious and it wasn't too sweet.  It was affordable but the wait was about 30-40min.
"My favorite rojak. His Chinese crullers and stuffed beancurd are grilled to perfection. Century egg is not the best but it work well with his sauce.
The sauce is perfect with a generous heap of peanut powder."
One of the best rojak in town
Nice and delicious
Without a doubt the best rojak in Singapore
"This rojak is great!! The ingredients, the sauce, the pickled ginger for century egg, all  Uncle and auntie were nice too. And yes, be prepared to wait but it's worth it"
Delicious rojak.  Be prepared for long wait.
This stall has been consistent since I started patronising 7yrs ago. My taste bud has become pampered by what I consider the best rojak and I haven't been able to accept lesser stalls since then. It is unfortunate as I stay quite far away and the long waiting time isn't helping.
Best rojak in singapore
Excellent rojak .. best come during off peak since they close late
Old timers favour... now hard to find such store sell...
Have been patronising this stall for at least 40 years.. love his rojak!!!
I ordered a rojak with toasted cuttlefish and century egg. It was good value for $6.50!
"Went there with high expectations. The prawn paste is super thick but taste not to my likings. I personally prefer the toa payoh , bukit timah food center and clementi ones"
1 hr waiting time 
"Wow! Still authentic after so many years.  The  The thick prawn paste  mixed with lot of peanuts blend really well with the usual salad, you tiao and tau pok.   The owner is cooking  every order one by one.  Can see the owner is really taking his cooking seriously.  Michelin guide, please award this stall the best rojak.  He deserve the recognition.  I am sure there are lot of supporter for the award!"
Very very delicious snacks. Highly recommended
My family and I are regular customers of this traditional rojak - we have this a few times in a week. Love the freshly charcoal toasted you tiao and bean curd that is mixed in with fresh turnip and pineapple together with the prawn based sauce and topped with crunchy peanuts. Highly recommended!  Do give a call before dropping by to avoid the long queue.
"One of the best, if not the best, rojak around!"
Probably the best rojak in Singapore. The Toa Payoh hub rojak offers value for money but the taste of Lau Hong Ser is very fine and balanced.
Best Rojak here in Katong maybe in Singapore
personally overated..
Best Rojak i tried sofar !
"Good , good"
"Best rojak in SG, but might need to wait a bit during peak hours!"
Very traditional taste
"My favorite in Singapore. Thick sauce, grilled tau pok and you tiao, fresh and juicy pineapple. Regret ordering SGD2.00 which is very small portion."
Best Rojak in SG IMHO
C&G standard. Cheap & Good. Rojak gravy just nice not wet or the dry version very crispy.
Whiting time long
Slow wait but oh so nice and crispy you tiao! With great sauce
The best in Singapore!
"Simply nice if you like thick sauce (peanut butter thick), charcoal to cook. Very traditional, went on a weekday evening, have to wait half an hour, totally worth the wait. Start from $2-$6 rojak."
"Walaw,, very stressed leh the uncle, hahahha i want to pay he scold me "" Come back later!!"""
"tasty , fresh , local  and cheap"
"While the rojak is good and freshly prepared, go for the ""B"" option which is the toasted tao kua stuffed with beansprouts, you tiao, cuttlefish and century egg! That is definitely the bomb!"
"My go to place for Rojak. Uncle's sauce is a perfect blend of sweet, salty and a hint of sourness. Each mouth full is an Umami bomb. Go during off peak times to avoid the wait, but still be prepared to wait as uncle takes great pains to make each serving individually, with all the ingredients tossed together to perfection."
Always tops when I need a traditional taste plate of Rojak
That place always closed..he got too much money.
Good variety of dishes and good taste.
"Uncle has the best rojak. He is funny - I was ordering from him & he told me very honestly, ""Bu Yao Tun Tun Tu Tu De,Gan Jin Jiao, confident confident"". Hahaha I got more nervous man. His wife is quiet and just gave a crooked smile. Their you tiao is nice and crispy without being burnt"
Easily one of the best Rojak in Singapore. This is without a doubt the most popular stall in Dunman Food Centre. Sometimes you have to wait up to an hour for your rojak. What make it stand out against other rojak is that the sauce is more thicker and more savoury. Highly recommend.
Different taste rojak than others
"the queue is like 1 hour just for a rojak, taste very different than normal singapore rojak. i think the uncle put some prawn taste so the sauce is a bit more sticky and smell more prawn-ish. the sauce texture is like indonesian gado2. i like singapore original version better. the queue and longgg wait makes this lose 1 star."
"delicious rojak -- thick sauce and there Uncle freshly makes it for every order. head there, order what you want and they might tell you to come back as there usually is a line. you can also call ahead"
"Best rojak i ever eaten, makes other rojak taste bad. MUST TRY!"
One of the best rojak I have tasted especially the hei gor it is really flavourful.
One of the BEST rojak you can ever find in Singapore. Tau pok and youtiao and very crispy which is good. Sauce is also special and the peanuts and grinded finely and roasted.
One of the best Rojak around! The wait can be very long most time.  Certainly well worth the wait.
"Opens till 2am on a Saturday. Very flavourful, hand grilled dried squid, crispy you tiao and sweet pineapples. A perfect mixture in the thick gravy."
"Packed the Chicken Rice home to eat. It was full of flavor, one of the delicious hawker here. Had their chicken rice for years. Love their chilli sauce which is mixed by themselves, not too spicy which is what i like, and garlicky. They cook their rice till each grain is separated clearly and covered with the Chicken Broth. I favored particularly towards White Chicken. Yumz!!! Not one of the cheapest hawker (quite cheap) but I love their food. Enjoyed their service very much too!  Do remember they sell out quite early in the evening."
Ordered charsiew and roast pork rice $5. Only this little amount of meat and worst of all 60-70% are burned (chao tar) parts! Inedible. That man is stingy and not steady in doing business.
The chicken rice is lack of taste. Chicken meat is hard. The chilli also cannot make it. The stall has queue because they are slow to serve.
Char siew is on the sweeter side. The skin of the roast meat is very crispy. Overall a good plate of roast meat with char siew rice.
"Tl:dr this is really a fine plate of chicken rice. Nice meat, nice rice. But chilli was kinda weak. Soup is good.

So I came to marine parade one afternoon, and felt like eating chicken rice.

Food
the white chicken is nice. The skin is nice, looks good, tasted good.
the white chicken meat is nice and tender, and not overcooked nor dry.
the rice itself is good. It is not overly oily, unlike those that spam oil on the rice
for chicken rice chilli standard, this one is rather meek. It doesn't pack a punch. Like even though i am a spicy eater, it doesnt even have the taste of spicy.

Specially ordered this interesting dish. Thai Style Chicken Feet.
nail the thai style perfectly, the onion and the sauce makes the sweet sour and tangy mixture really well
the chicken feet is actually the skin of the chicken feet and it was boiled before so there isnt any taste
because of how tasteless the chicken feet skin is, most of the taste comes from the sauces, and the skin adds a nice texture to eat it with

Service
they saw me approach and stood up immediately
removed the bones
asked if i want the soup

Atmosphere
came on friday evening so abit crowded and noisy"
Tasty chicken rice!
Char siew and siew yuk rice was decent - some parts of the siew yuk had more fats than meat and the big portion wasn't very big! Ordered on Grab and paid $17.40 including delivery.
Chicken had no taste but tender&well cooked. Rice was ok

At Marine parade Central hawker today. Ordered their roasted meat x chicken with more rice is just $6. Large portion yea! Crispy roasted meat that is a must to try and tag along with their cabbage soup which is sweet and a sauce of chill which is just nice of spicy level.
"Very poor service, plenty of chickens but just because drum sticks were selling faster insisted customer buy other portions."
"First time I tried this because I could not locate the Char Kway Teow and what a find!

Chicken is very tender and the complimentary soup so flavourful.  Price point is value for money as the portions were generous

Would have been perfect if the chilli sauce is much more spicer!"
"Ordered two drumsticks! Spotted him kept a few pcs. You can't see from the font as this guy block it up with pots and pans!!
If you take away, just watch now!"
"The chicken was so flavourful and tender, the rice was perfect. The soup was not the best but it really did the job and it was hot which is so important. Very good chicken rice in a post covid Singapore, where the chicken rice in a lot of places have dropped in standard. If you feel like eating chicken rice, this place will not disappoint. The woman who served me was also really nice."
"Chicken rice below average, rice has not much fragrance"
"This stall commands the longest queue in this hawker centre. Chicken rice was kind of small portioned. Chicken meat was tender. Roast pork was a bit hard in some parts. Soup was vegetable soup. It's not bad. Worth the queue? Maybe not, if you are in a hurry. But if no queue, go ahead and try."
"Reminds me of my childhood roasted pork rice I enjoyed. The ""oily"" rice is delicious! Not oily at all!"
Very nice chicken rice. Nicest in this hawker centre.
"Literally one of the best chicken rice hawker we've tried!!

It was our first time at Promenade Market and we had no idea what to try. Went for the one with the longest queue and I'm glad we did.

Mine was the Roasted Chicken Breast with rice, wife had the white chicken selection. Man oh man it was juicy! The rice was rather not oily and cooked to perfection! You can see the shop owners take pride in their food and doing what they do. How many times do you see a hawker that purposely lit up the insides of their stalls! This shows me their cleanliness right off the bat. As I'm a great fan of Chicken Breast, this was one of the rare times I managed to clean my plate! Many times you'll have hawkers giving you other parts than the one you ordered. My wife's white chicken was also springy and fresh! Their soup is also of great quality, not oily and less to no MSG added. Normally I'll skip the soup if you look at my past reviews of Chicken rice shops as they are often meh but am glad we didn't skip on this one. My wife also gave 2 thumbs up. These pictures are taken at 16:14 on a Sunday and they are virtually sold out. Non-stop serving customers for the past 30 minutes we've been sitting here.

We even saved the location on Google. Made our day! A must try if you're in the area or not!"
Cheap and good! Friendly owner too.
Rice is dry. Meat is not that juicy.
"I eat here every weekend.

Nice store owners, friendly.

Most importantly, food is great. They take making their chicken rice seriously. Rice is fragrant, and fluffy

Chicken is tender and flavourful. The chicken rice soy sauce is clearly made themselves with correct herbs, and done well.

One of the few chicken rice stores that actually put effort into their soup. Soup is well flavoured with root vegetables and cabbage. Not dishwashing liquid

Chilli is great too, very fresh and citrusy. Overall, they do a great rendition of a singaporean classic, at an affordable price"
12/06/21 order true Grabfood total good bill was is 13.90( char siew roasted pork rice 10.20 add on rice and add on sup) first sup in empty sup normally we will get just for free but they selling for 2.50. char siew roasted pork rice 10.20 I choose big though will have extra meat but not is regular. Add on rice brought though can eat with extra meat. Totally disappointed. I strongly recommend to the shop owner to review your price and the worth of food you deliver. Don't just think 
Very nice chicken rice.The meat is very nice and the chilli is awesome.
Definitely good Hainan Chicken Rice with good effort on rice and chilli sauce. Hainanese stall owner
gooood good
Clean honest
Really good chicken rice
Best chicken rice I ever had
Nice. $3 and $4 chicken rice. Soup provided is hot and still fresh. Tasty too.
"Chicken rice is good. The rice is cooked al dente, nice texture."
Mediocre chicken rice and expensive
"Chicken nicely done, rice full of chicken flavour, and the soup is nice. Not of superb quality, but good enough for this price."
"This is a decadent, rich and (clearly) premium seafood soup stall nestled in one of the industrial buildings coffee shop.

Ordered the batang seafood soup small ($9) with rice ($0.50). Large soup is at $11.50. I'm not sure if its upsellimg or genuine scarcity, but the owner said dory fish ($7) sold out. Hence I opted for the more expensive batang fish.

The soup comes with 3 generous meat ball, but i term them meat chunks. Batang fish slices normal to a portion that you would get in a fish soup, maybe slighy more and 2 prawns.

First off the soup, honestly this makes or breaks it. I must say that the cloudly look shrouds a milky, umami taste which is very addicting when you drink it. It's a great first component, filled with a very rich taste.

The meat chunks next, I found it pretty okay but the end bite has a bit of a weird feel for me, like it crumbles to a bit of a powdery sensation. The meat chunks are nice, but I wouldnt go back for them.

Batang slices - I think I had 6. These are the thick ones with a good chew. Really nice indeed.

Lastly, 2 succulent prawns. They were amazing, really shows the premium quality and hence the high price. Prawns were big and very yummy. You have to peel them all yourself though.

Overall, a very decadent and rich (literally) meal. But I'm not tripping, $9.50 at a coffee shop no matter what you are serving is expensive, and that makes me very critical of the quality and taste of what they are serving.

Overall, its a star studded bowl of high quality seafood soup, I recommend trying if you're in the area or if you're really craving a premium type of seafood soup. Personally for me I'll only come back if I really crave this. It is very pricey considering the location. Still I found the price justifable and yes, worth a try."
"Came on a Sunday evening with relatively low expectations after I have given up on this style of seafood soup with disappointing visits over the years to others like ""YJ"" and ""JL"".

And at the price point of $15.50 for the large red grouper fish soup, my expectations were raised.

Omg! It delivered! Finally, a stall that has ignited my faith again in this style of seafood soup after years of disappointment.

And the value it delivered surpasses the price paid from the first mouthful with a thick and rich soup full of umami. There's a difference between Xian Tian vs Chou Xing. Most of the recent stalls for this style of seafood soup delivered the latter but this stall... gosh... it is pure umami. There's 3 large prawns, generous slices of red grouper and pork meatballs, all of which are so fresh that you have to try it to understand it!"
"Tang Tou Hen Nong Hen Gou Wei,Yu Rou Xin Xian Zhu Rou Yuan Hen Hao Chi Huan Hui Zai Lai "
Must give a 5 for the seafood soup. Superb flavourful but good foods always not come with cheap yea.... The staff service was excellent too 
"Very flavourful seafood soup! Big fresh prawns, thick slices of grouper, crayfish is fresh too. I got lucky today to get crayfish with roe! Although it's seafood soup, my favourite part is their minced meat pork balls, very tasty flavoured with dried sole fish, I always add $2 more! Addition of tomatoes and shiitake mushrooms adds even more umami. Can't imagine the flavour if they alcohol like XO and also can add even more seafood like sotong, scallops, crabs etc."
Nice for raining day
"Below average bowl of prawn noodles. $6.80 for this portion is criminal. 2 prawns and barely any veg. The soup was very mid. I was starving and it was my first meal of the day at 4pm so imagine how bad it must've been.

Whoever gave this place 5 stars is either the owner or has defective taste buds."
"If you pass by here, you can just skip this. Not nice at all. Service is slow, soup is tasteless. Doesn't even feel like they put in effort to brew the soup. The dark earthy coloured broth is plain af. Order taker also can take it wrong. And simply pour off the soup for the wrongly made bowl and put some chilli to end it. I think many shops can make better than them. And the pork ribs are full of bones. Not worth a try. Go elsewhere with your money."
Had my brunch at Laing Zai Prawn Noodle. Prawns are fresh and Pork ribs & Tails are tendered. Highly recommended

"Soup was flavourful but rather diluted. At $6.80, there were only two halves of a small prawn as well as ribs with barely any meat. Staff was friendly."

"Old-fashion braised pork rice. Taiwanese style. You have to try. Recommend to order the braised peanuts which are big, and the salted vegetables too."
Every yummy braised food. My grandson loved the food n asked to visit every week
"Braised pork trotter and intestines braised to the right taste , not too robust or overpowered but with tint of fragrant soya sauces and spices. Would be perfect if the trotter was a bit more tender and the lean meat tends to be hard and dry.
Mee Sua was well prepared with light sweat soup ."
"Ordered Lu Rou Fan, the entire bowl is overly drenched in gravy. Too salty."
"Tres bon pour un prix raisonnable, je recommande !"
"The portion looks moderate but not particularly large. You have a decent amount of braised intestines and other offal in a dark soy-based sauce, but it doesn't seem like a full meal on its own--more like a side dish or a snack.

If this came with rice or noodles, $5 would be a solid deal at a hawker centre. But if it's just the offal, it's on the slightly pricier side for hawker food, unless the quality is exceptional or it's in a higher-cost area.

As described by ChatGPT"
"Perhaps the best stall in this not so busy Dunman Food Centre. While many food stalls do not deserve  their high Google rating, this one truly deserves its 4.6 rating. A small stall but the food items are passionately prepared and cooked by the lady stall holder. We tried the braised pork set and a fish soup, they both were well cooked and refined."
Both the braised food and the fish soup are very tasty and the price is reasonable.
"Best La Mian I tasted in a long while, dun waste your time queuing at places like DTF or Crystal Jade, just come here!"
Everything is fantastic. We have been coming for years and I have always enjoyed my meal.
Braise meet fish soup ...
I had the Hakka Braised Pork La Mian with Egg (Dry) for lunch just moments ago and I must say it was one of the tastiest bowls of Braised Pork La Mian that I have ever had. Will certainly be back for other items on the menu.
"Braised pork legs are good.  Meat was tender and flavorful.
Pickled vegetables are good too. Spicy, sour and a bit salty."
Nice food and generous lady owner. Must support. Katong Dunman Food Court Famous Braised Pork meals
Food was really good and had to come back for more!
"Shi Wo Chi Guo Zui Hao Chi De Lu Rou La Mian,You Ti Gong Xuan Ze La He Bu La,Wo Ge Ren Tui Jian Xiao La,Fen Liang Ye Hen Bang"

"Yummy braised pork rice, tofu was soft and pork belly was tender."
Deliciously generous portions. Highly recommended!!
I had a crunch of good time during my last moments at Joo Chiat Place Dunman Hawker Centre in Singapore 
Tried both the fish soup and the braised pork rice. They taste great and had generous potions. Highly recommend you pay a visit to show the store owner support!
Hakka Taiwanese style braised pork rice
"The food was good. We tried their Zhao Pai Ke Jia Lu Rou Fan Zong He (signature Hakka braised pork rice bowl with bean curd, egg, tau ok, preserved vegetables with rice). The portion was very very generous for a 6 dollars dish.

Will definitely try again."
"food tastes really great!
I had the Signature Hakka Braised Pork Rice that costed $6. Good portion, not too small. Just enough portion.

It's like a home-cooked meal by your mom. A kind & friendly auntie serves the meal. Price is also reasonable & affordable.

Had a lovely meal here. Definitely will come back in the future."
Very yummy  the auntie is also nice! will definitely come back!
"After reading the raving reviews,  I decided to check this place out. The stall opens at 11 am, and I was there at 11:30 am, hoping to beat the lunchtime crowd. There was no queue. I ordered the $7 set meal and was given an electronic tag. While seated, I noticed that the owner was busy preparing online orders. These orders were massive for 5 sets or more per order. The business receives bookings from Deliveroo and GrabEats. It is also operated by only 1 person. My food came 25 mins later on a weekday! The braised meat tastes delicious but comparable to some of the best kway chap stores. My mother's version is just as good. They use medium grain rice, and the salted vegetables taste good. It's really not worth queuing to beat the online orders. You simply have little inkling of how many of such orders are ahead of you. I find the portion small for $7."
"I genuinely believe this is the best Lu Rou anything in SG. The shop-owner and chef,  Eileen, runs a one-man show but there's so much thought into the cooking and good quality ingredients. She tweaked the recipe to serve Hakka style braised meat - to me, it's better than Taiwan style which has a thicker and sweeter sauce (I always struggle to finish the Taiwanese style ones but here I can finish everything even though it's such generous portions). The rice/ Lu Rou Fan is nice but I like the La Mian more. They also do a yummy fish soup if you want even more comforting things!"
Tasty braised meat bowl
Ordered their braised minced pork noodle and braised pork trotter noodle. They're really excellent! Will return again!
Great food and great value.
"Hidden gem at Dunman Food Centre.
Busy hawker area - be prepared to wait for your food.

Braised Meat Rice is yummy without being salty. Best meal I'd had in a long time."
"Poor service, food so so only, the auntie give very little fish for that kinda price, just because now you have a big following become so arrogant, not buying from you any more"
Tried both zhu jiao and fish soup on separate occasions. Honestly i really dont get the hype. Meat is tough and dry. Lots of ingredients but very ex too so don't feel that its worth the money and won't bother getting again.
"The flavor is very nice. However, I do prefer a thicker sauce with a stronger punch.

Ordered the noodles too. It was cooked nicely. The sauce can be tweaked to provide more flavor."
"I really want to support small business but this store is a little bit ridiculous. I ordered a fish soup to takeaway and there's an additional charge of 20cents to addition of evaporated milk which was not reflected on the menu, but the owner just said ""the regular customers all know it"", ok can.

Then when I went back home and open up the cover, the soup is less than half the bowl?? It's not even half the bowl filled and there was only 3 to 4 pieces of fish. It is a tad absurd considering I paid $5.50 to have two scoops of soup?

Their other menu items are fine but avoid the fish soup entirely (as you can tell from the rest of the reviews, not their best item and probably should remove it from the menu entirely)."
"After seeing the high rating on Grab, I've decided to order signature braised pork rice and yuan yang fish soup for delivery. The stall called to apologise and inform me that they have forgotten to pack the soup inside so I'll only received the fish soup without the soup and my braised rice, they then requested me to raise the refund on Grab portal. It was really kind of them to inform me beforehand so I don't get any surprise. The braised rice was on point and flavourful. However when I tried to take a second bite, I found a big piece of plastic which seems like it was braised together with the meat. Totally horrified by the experience and not sure if I'll give this stall another chance.."
The food is really hot
Serving was quite little for the price and the set. Taste wise is ok

This stall here offers their braised pork rice in a huge bowl and braised offerings for you to add on to make it a proper meal."

"i order yuan yang batang fish soup noodles where my noodles......

first time order get disapointed......"
"Very satisfying braised pork belly with rice paired with taupok, preserved veg, hard boiled egg and that lovely gravy. It's surprisingly run by only a middle aged lady so do be patient when peak hours arrive as she does receive a lot of delivery orders. It's worth the wait nevertheless."
Enjoyed Lu Rou Fan (braised pork rice) and Yuen Yang fish soup for lunch. Love the traditional braised pork with chili and becoming a fan of the soup too   Proprietor is very friendly and swapped my egg for extra vegetables
"A mixed platter consisted of beancurd, tofu puff, intestine, pork belly & skin, braised egg. It is well cleaned and cooked just nice. The ingredients were fresh and well flavored.

Braising liquid leaned towards the salty side. Light style rather than the heavy tasting one."
"This is really good quality hawker food !
I ordered the chefs recommendation of the braised pork set that comes with rice. I ordered a side fish soup ! The aunty says it's too much for one person. I had to tell her I eat a lot before she was willing to sell me . LOL! Total amount spent $10.80!!!! Come on price and quality all have !"
"One Word - Recommended !

IMHO:

Pork Belly + Intestine - Softer will be more nice ! The Salted Veg - Nice !

Will return to try others, i.e. pig trotter leg."
The batang fish noodles soup is nice too.

"Lin's Braised.
271 Onan Rd, #02-29, Singapore 424768. That's Dunman Food Centre.
Daily from 1100H until 2030H.
Closed on Saturdays.

Ordered the Chef's Recommendation, Signature ""Hakka"" Braised Pork rice bowl. Served with Beancurd, Braised egg, Taupok, Preserved vegetables. Served with rice.

I've never been a fan of Taiwanese cuisine, except for their braised Pork, be it Pork belly or mince. Other items are just too oily. Their deep fried stuff are just way too bland, even for a Teochew boy. They'd add taste by sprinkling Plum powder, Chilli powder, Pepper blah blah blah.

I'm not saying that Taiwanese cuisine is bad, just to set the records straight. I'm just not a fan, that's all.

That said, the dish here is amazeballs. The Pork belly was melt-in-your-mouth.

The Taupok soaked up all of the love potion, hence its plump appearance. When you bite into it, I swear. I thought Ah Mei was singing Ting Hai behind me. It was a burst, or should I say, explosion of flavours (from the herbs and spices used to braise). Good lah, I tells ya.

Don't get me started on the Pig's intestines. But screw it. I'm starting now. It was so well done that it was buttery. No hints of Porkie-pigginess. None. Nada.

Slightly chewy in a good way, but melts away, at the core. Definitely one of the best Pig's intestines to have ever danced in my mouth. Oh. It was actually peppery in taste too. It was like magic. Where did she hide the Pepper? Love it.

Rice was short, unlike the regular Jasmines. Pearly goodness. Soaking up the broth from the Witch's cauldron. This is the only time, where I have a lumpy, soggy portion of rice. I'm a very dry rice kind of eating machine.

The chilli dip? Nice. The tangy bit helped chase the greasiness away from the proteins. Spiciness level was neutral, to me that is. Garlicky goodness too.

I spoke to the lady and she said that she tweaked the recipe a little, to suit our local palate, hence ""Hakka"", to cut down the sweetness, as the original Taiwanese dish is much sweeter. Good job, good foresight.

Overall, very impressive, for a nondescript stall. I'd be seen here more often.

*the flow of customers just kept on coming to her. 1400H on a Monday.

9.5/10"

"Took out a packet of standard braised pork rice for a quick lunch - wow! The braised gravy soaked every strand of rice by the time I was home. Flavourful, and in good portion. the tau pok is not dry but soaked in more gravy. Good mix of fatty and lean parts for the pork too. The chilli is strangely pungent on the nose, but tasted more sweet and sour.

Gonna go back again to try out the pork skin and intestine next!"
Really good braised pork and short grain rice. Pig's trotter is especially excellent.
Love the signature braised pork rice! Super yummy!
"Hao Chi De Lu Rou Fan Shi Jia Liao Mei Cai De Ke Jia Feng Wei
Sheng Yi Hen Hao Xu Yao Xiao Pai Dui
Da Yue 11:45 Cai Zheng Shi Ying Ye"
Really good & clean fish soup! Quality ingredients 
"Quite far from my place, definitely should drop by if you close to the area, good portion of braised pork bowl"
"I highly recommend:
1. Signature hakka braised pork rice - very generous amount of sauce and ingredients (minced pork, pork belly, tofu, tau pok, egg)
2. Braised pig trotter
3. Braised pork belly
4. Salted vegetables
5. Braised tau pok

I also like other dishes but think still have some room for improvements:
1. Noodle - good taste but a bit soggy. Likely due to takeaway. It is a bit spicy.
2. Big intestines- good texture but still have a little bit of smell"
"This is a surprise find. All the better known stalls in the food centre is almost closed by the time I reached there. Browsed round the remaining atalls at least 4 rounds before I settle on Lin's and boy am I glad that I chose that.

Ordered a braised pork trotter rice that was a rice bowl filled with chunks of meat. The trotter skin was tender yet not totally soft so that you can still feel it's texture, and the meat has absorbed all the strong braised flavors and hence a delight. Strongly recommend to add another beancurd if you can as it was extremely good soaked in the braised sauce. Of course such combinations can be found in some other similar stalls but Lin's bowl does not give you the usual greasy after taste and you will not feel icky after downing the entire bowl. So do drop in and try something new instead of all the usual popular stalls there. Enjoy "
"Hearty, tasty and affordable fare. Lu Rou fan was chock full of ingredients and tasted authentic. The big intestines were well seasoned and cleaned proper. To top it off, auntie is a sweetheart."
"I am not trying to find fault with anyone, just solely want to take this ground to talk about my experience. It is about how rude and judgmental the stall holder is. The auntie took my order by writing it down on the takeaway box then just shoved it aside. She subsequently told me to wait for 30 minutes. When I first heard the wait time, I thought this applied to everyone but turns out it only applies to those ""not in a rush for time""? Wow equality at its best. What made me conclude that this wait time only applies to me was because she attended to the other customers after me and prepared their orders straight away(it includes a mixture of dine ins and take-aways). A word of advice to the stall holder would be to attend to the customers on a first come first serve basis to avoid any quarrels and discontentment.

Okay but to make it fair, food has varieties and is appetizing so I gave it 2 stars.

But then again when it comes to f&b, food is not everything, the service and etiquette are also equally important. You wouldn't want to tolerate a lousy, rude and condescending service just for a tantalizing plate of braised rice which I am sure can be found with better quality and even taste elsewhere(probably at a higher price, but i'll take just it as i'm paying for the good ambience and service).

Rather than beating about the bush, my point is, work on the service, the way u serve customer since you sell good and quality food, and your establishment wld flourish."
"Amazing Hakka braised pork rice, brought my grandpa to eat and he absolutely loved it. Comes with eggs and preserved vegetables. The braised pork rice bowl is not too saltly, unlike other rice bowl. Very aromatic and well seasoned. Super authentic and a rare find in Singapore, this is a hidden gem! There really isn't any store like this. There might be a queue at times but it's worth the wait.

The price is very worth it, very fulling. The big bowl can be shared by 2 small eaters and it comes with an additional tofu, so I would recommend getting someone with you to eat a big bowl!"
"I tried the braised platter with dry spicy la mian. My oh my!
Let's review the la mian first...
* Great QQ texture
* Asorbs the spicy sauce very well
* Insane but enjoyable level of spices in the sauce, with a tinge of vinegar and sesame seeds for that aroma.

Braised platter is very enjoyable as well. My only complaint is that the braised sauce is quite salty, I would prefer it to be less salty but more aromatic and a little sweeter. Noteworthy mention on the big intestine - well cooked with no smell. The braised platter consists of big intestine, pork belly, pork skin, one full egg, tau kwa and tau pok.

The dishes are definitely cooked with love. I will be back to try other dishes and support this little gem in the East."
Signature Braised Pork rice bowl. Lots of work done for this simple bowl. Totally worth it.
"really enjoyed their lu rou fan the last time i was here! generous portion size and the taste is definitely above average. today i tried their fish soup and was pleasantly surprised at how fresh the fish was! it also came in generous chunks 
be sure to patronise and support this stall!"
Chunky fish soup and tender pork! I will definitely be back back to try their other pork dishes and la mian. Fish soup is on the saltier side.
"5.80 fish soup is on the high side for hawker, but most value for money fish soup I had. Their fish are chunky and not sliced paper thin like how others like to do it to short change customers. It's fresh and the soup is flavourful. I didn't try the pork rice but my partner did and sing praises for it too. Serving size is generous, hope it stays this way."
"Definitely one of the better stalls for all things braised pork. This gem is a one lady show so do expect to wait abit though she is pretty efficient and quick. There will be a queue.
The pigs trotter was perfectly cooked (really tender) and the tau pok is as good as any I have tried. The braised intestines is one of the best I have had. If u love kway chap, you will love this.
The fish soup is really good as well.
Definitely coming back"

The large intestines and salted vege are well prepared and the chili sauce is pretty good too. However I personally did not enjoy the braised pork rice as much as I thought I would but I feel that's more of a personal taste. There were lots of others ordering it. Would be back to try her other dishes.
Tender and flavorful.
Lovely fish soup and portions for the braised pork rice was very generous.
A hearty bowl of lu rou fan.
"Great experience, exotic taste very different from regular hawker food."
We live in Taiwan and very like Eileen's cuisine.  Thanks to her bringing us homelike kitchen. We believe all friends in Singapore will have good food experiences here. Enjoy it!
"Yummy new stall at the Dunman Hawker Center! Ordered the special braised meat rice for takeaway. The meat is cooked nicely and really soft, and the fats melt in the mouth! The dark sauce is nicely salted with a tint of sweetness. They are also generous with ingredients. Only downside is the rice is a little too soft to my personal liking.
Will definitely go back for more and try other dishes!

Added: Came back for lunch dine in. They provide nice bowls and utensils, kudos to the attention. The taste is closer to the Taiwanese braised rice Lu Rou Fan. This time I really like the rice, which is cooked nicely. The rice are good quality ""pearl"" rice Zhen Zhu Fen. The quality and attention is a plus for food in hawker centres."
I like the Braised Pork Rice
Set your expectations low and you will be rewarded. I personally think it is yummy and delicious for what it costs. Full of nutrients and great tasting.
"The soup is not bad, but not the best. The dry rice provided separately added an impt aspect to the pap fan. However, I cannot figure out if the thing besides the dry rice is pork floss or fried egg...
I ordered double fish version (sliced and fried fish) but the portion of fish is quite little. The dried fish is not very crispy at all.

Overall,  it's edible, the shop have a lot to improve on."
"I must say I was rather put off by the disparity between the picture on their menu and the actual product, which is straight off false advertising.

I had the Iberico Pork set, but I'm sure it's not Iberico Pork that they use, which again is false advertising.

Having said that, I must say the taste is rather good.  The broth is savoury and hearty.  And I appreciate that they serve the crispy rice puffs and fried egg floss separately, to be added by yourself at time of eating to keep the crisp.

Overall a good enough meal that I world certainly come back again to try their other iterations."
"Must try, the roastporkbelly..skin is crispy and the meat juicy, not dry dry...haven't eaten such a good one for a long while."
"this is my favourite roast duck rice in singapore! the roast duck is marinated in curry spices and i always order the San Bao Fan which gives me roast pork, char siew and roast duck.

i love it when uncle helps me to debone the duck so i can just scoop and eat.

make sure you ask for the curry sauce to go on top!!

oh they also provide a very nicely seasoned cabbage soup with every order!

please do come and support!! i will cry if this place closes :(("
My family loves it so much. The charsiu and roast pork rice is a must try. Very reasonable price. Even if it is located in Joo Chiat but I make sure to dabao back in Jurong for our dinner! 
"Their char shao shao rou fan is just incredible  the curry gravy really elevates the overall flavor. Their vegetable soup is delish too.

Too bad the stall isn't on any delivery app"
"Tried cos i saw the reviews, had the roast pork with char siew. Uncle asked if i want to lim curry zhup on the rice!?

What??? This is so new to me, i never had roast pork and charsiew rice with curry. But honestly this is a very delicious combo, pork is crispy too."
"This is a surprise find! Ordered the roasted duck, charsiew and roasted pork. All 3 meat items were great and would definitely return. Big portion and value for money."
Yummy roast duck rice
"I tried the roasted pork belly, BBQ meat (char siew), and roasted duck leg, and all three dishes were decent. My favourite among them was the roasted pork belly.

Interestingly, I initially expected it to be served with curry sauce due to the Chinese name, but there was no curry flavour in sight. After closer inspection of the English name on the shop banner, it read ""special roasted meat with curry flavour"". Despite the absence of curry flavour, it didn't impact the taste negatively.

Additionally, I was pleasantly surprised by the exceptional quality of the soup for a hawker stall."
Brilliant idea of combining roast meast with curry. My fav charsiew rice now!
Accommodating to my request awesome roasted pork and duck
Hearty and value for money! Relatively large portion of meat for the price paid!
"I like the food stall and was blown away by the delicious food at such a reasonable price. Not only that, but the owner was incredibly generous and friendly, making my experience even more enjoyable. Highly recommend trying the duck rice! Will definitely be back soon!"
"Came with high expectations as I read good reviews and that there is curry. I ordered roasted pork and char siew rice, nothing special and there is no curry at all as the name of the stall suggested. Meat was rather salty and quite similar to what you can get from any roasted delight stall you can easily find at a coffee shop. Quite a disappointing experience."
"Delicious, this is 5 SGD"
I had the char siew rice and it's overall a very good experience. The char siew is well marinated and had a nice amount of charred bits on the sides. Special mention on the chili - you can pick the sambal with ikan bilis or the vinegary garlicky one. Both are yummy. Portions are generous and costs $3.80. Highly recommend!
"Delicious char siew rice and really generous with the meat. The meat is more like stewed char siew kind rather than the char grilled kind. However, they ran out of cucumber before 12pm, I think most likely because they do not serve them?"
"Speaking with the stall owner I learnt he used to be a professional chef who decided to start his own business. Roast meats are consistently flavourful and juicy. Roast pork sells out fast, followed by the soy chicken, popular with the frequent customers. Also my go to favorites for lunch. Roast duck comes with a very fragrant sauce if you ask for it. My favorite thing is having the curry with the rice. Adds a tons of flavour. Usually sells out by 5pm. If you manage to come for an early lunch around 11am is when the meats are piping hot."
Succulent chicken and crispy duck ... crawling roast pork with sambal ikan bili as a star ... we prefer without curry sauce
"Paid $8 for a to-go mutton briyani, and it was an absolute rip-off. The rice wasn't even the proper long-grain variety--just some random, unauthentic version. The portion looked big, but it was all an illusion. The ""mutton"" was just a giant bone with barely any meat (80% bone, 20% meat at best). How am I supposed to eat this with plastic utensils?! Completely impractical and disappointing.

The only decent thing was the curry--it was okay, but nothing special.

To top it off, the drinks stall charged $2.50 for a simple iced tea (teh-o ais) in a plastic cup/bag--daylight robbery.

Never coming back, and I'd strongly advise others to avoid this place unless you enjoy wasting your money."
"We have tried their murtabak (chicken & sardine), mee kuah, mee goreng combo & sop tulang merah. All very yummy! The sop tulang merah is not too spicy or sweet like in Beach Rd."
"Have been a regular patron of the shop. They serve one of the best mee goreng, beef steak kuah and prata Dalcha. Worth every penny."
"So far, this is the best sup tulang merah I've tried in Singapore. Pretty large portion $10. Paid $2 for a loaf of bread"
"Good food but due to being busy, can be quite a wait."
"Dining in is ok. Food are delicious.
But when comes to delivery, they always missed out few items.
The person preparing for delivery should make sure all items are packed.
I encounter this on few occassions."
Finally found the best indian rojak here. the gravy was fantastic!
"Ordered through Food Panda their Kuay Teow Goreng, Mee Kuah and Mee Goreng. Very nice overall and leaves you with a paus feeling :) Only suggestion is to add a couple of Chili Padis for some heat. Will defo order again!"
"For those living in North area and passing by, you don't have to trouble to go all the way to West Coast, (Ayer Rajah food centre) just to have the Best mamak dishes & rojak!

Here at BLK 693 woodlands Ave 6, they are serving it for everyone.

Awesome serving, taste and affordable pricing!
Best in Woodlands,for current. 

Nasi goreng mamak + sunny side-up egg : $5.20
Enjoy the meal"
I always do alot of Roti prata grabfood delivery for this shop
Many food to choose from.
"All time favourite available at all time
reasonable priced
plenty of options"
Amazing authentic food.
"This food court is a regular haunt of mine, boasting a fantastic variety of local dishes. But there's one stall that consistently draws a long queue: Lai Xing Prawn Noodle. In my opinion, it serves one of the best authentic prawn noodles I've ever tasted - even surpassing some I've had in Penang! Just one look at the color of the soup tells you everything you need to know. And the crispy pork lard? That's truly the icing on the cake. Thumb up for the clean and spotless kitchen as well. Be prepared for a wait, but it's absolutely worth it for a bowl of truly authentic prawn noodles. Happy trying!"

Food is nice
Pricier A bit now but if you like those like early morning market atmosphere in the 2000 or 1995 is the right place a bit nosier thought but bus service is pack possible increasing the timing shorter wait for commuters. Generally can get what you want for domestics home item.
Most stalls served cheap and affordable food apart from a few that are more well - known.

"Very busy and vibrant place. Food not bad. one stop wet market, cheap and fresh."
Sunday crowd. Fresh groceries. Cheaper than any supermarket.
"Some of the hawkers like to put their stuff on the table near their stall especially under the fans and chope place there. This makes it difficult for customers patronizing other stalls to find seats or to be sitted under cooler table as the place is deem stuffy especially in the day time.

Can still get $3 per plate of nice  chicken rice at Yong Seng chicken & duck rice stall. Uncle (though he isn't the stall owner) despite having to pay rent, said that there's alot of elderlies in this area hence he was selling at $2 per plate of chicken rice. Price went up to $3 about just a year ago, probably due to high rental bah. Other places you may probably get $3.50 per plate or higher amount.
TODAY 31Jan2024 is the final day Yong Seng dood stall is operating ):

Coffee at Jing Loong Jin Long is great , so used to drinking their Kopi  O Gao which is $1.10 per glass,  but have to be make by the boss ie atthe stall facing the shops.

Chong Dian Shi Bian Yi!
Environment and ventilation were not great. Wide selection of stalls. There is 1 vegetarian stall within this food centre.
"old and dirty hawker centre with even dirtier old patrons (some of them) but i can't deny that it has a lot of good food. love coming by for breakfast - tons of cheap choices to explore, such as the silky tau huay and delicious uncle pancake!"
Lots of good food but also lots of stalls closed by afternoon. I frequently go Kitchen carrot cake and Lai Hua Fishball noodles.
Nostalgic place.
Seafood is the cheapest at North area
upgrading now. was a very old hawker centre.. 35 years old at least this hawker /market . although had been upgraded..
"Your typical old school hawker, with many variety of food. Affordable food and lots of cheap offering of items within the vicinity of the food centre."
"Dirty as usual, and most stalls have raised their prices, again.   Parking is another hassle. It seems to have gotten worst."
When to patronised at SHAJ food center 01-04 ....the thosai was superb and the chutney was fantastic....just word caution....they operate from 6am til 12 pm and they have other Indian breakfast food also.... affordable and very tasty
All the breakfast food was nice especially the Appom....it was crispy and very tasty as well....well worth for the money spent
"Prawn noodles facing the bus stop is extremely good with generous serving of pork. Mee soto is good as well. The wontan noodles facing the shelter is good also, but close on sat."
To include more HALAL food varieties
Not that many stalls opened during lunch time... fish soup price went up but still nice. tables Abit dirty
"crowded Sunday breakfast crowd.
parking is also busy.

food price is good n quality not bad
several coffee shops in same location along with shops n wet market."
"I order the $8.50 Seafood Soup, 3 big prawns with fish meat & lots of minced meat. Soup is yummy as it has the prawn sweetness, prawns consider fresh & fish meat is soft. You may need to wait quite awhile if it's during lunch or dinner time."
Not seen vegetarian food
"Good and cheap fruits, old school vibe."
A lot of food and another thing.
For simple food in a neighbourhood hawker is a ok choice to fill ones hungry

Nice neighborhood hawker centre and market place in the Northern part of Singapore.
I ordered a bowl of dry ban mee. The noodles were plucked from the dough in person on the spot then put to cook. A generous serving at $4
Large variety of halal and non halal food here
There are many food to select.
"Sunday is a good day see the buzz of the lively food centre and stores.  It's a good place to buy fresh fruits among the stores and makeshift stalls selling durians. I bought $50 worth of fruits, excluding durains. Queues were long among several popular hawker stalls.  There's also the well known bah kuteh stall at the coffeeshop."
old hawker centre ambience and service. neighborliness is Why I like this place. food is also value for the buck.
"It's not as big / spacious.
It is slightly more price friendly."
Tempat riadah dan beli belah yang baik
"This place has variety of food. Prices are reasonable $4-5. Tried the dry chilli pan mian and was good. Uncle would knead the dough and Aunty roll the dough on d spot to make individual bowl of ban mian. The dry ban mian cost $4 was good. The mkt  has soya bean stall selling refreshing soya bean. A bit stuffy if seated inside but the good food comprises the environment, charge for use of toilet. Toilet could be improved-wet floor."
Food was good and inexpensive. :)
Tempat bagus dan pengalaman baru
"Old hawker center, but always reliable. Personally, food is good."
"Great varieties of local food. Even have a stall selling bread and buns. Whatever we like will most likely be there. Char Kway Teow, carrot cake, hokkien mee,  prawn noodle, fishball noodle, wanton mee, economic rice, nasi pandang, chicken rice,"
"Lots of stalls to try if you have the time to explore. The SK fish soup hasn't open yet. Probably they operate dinner timing.
Today ordered 3 packets of hainanese chicken rice and was quite disappointed with the taste."
Serving affordable foodstuffs to the surrounding people.
"The one ton mee here is superb!!!
Found my penang old school taste here surprisingly "
"Prawn mee , kua teow tng , mee hoon ker traditional style, soy sauce and poached chicken are my favourites day meals. As for night time satay , pigs trotters in garlic black gravy sauce is best tender n soft ."
Best place to have your meal and do morning marketing
"Went there 3 times still can't buy wanton noodles, quite always very long"
"Its more to a local old market area and local "" oldies"" food and dishes however its rather clean wet marker.

Good cheap prices but only for Breakfast and Lunch..only few stall open till 7.30pm.
Not reccommended for diners after 7.00pm as not much foodstuffs and market area only many ppl till after lunch time."
Favorite wet market in the north.

"-- Ter's Teochew Fishball Noodles --
Went and tried Ter's Teochew Fishball Noodles. Ordered 2 portions of noodles one being an upsize noodle portion ($4.50). Portion of noodles were miserable to begin with, and both came with the same amount of noodles. The ingredients were equally dismal, portions came with 2 fishballs and 2 thin slices of fishcakes each. For this level of service and quality of food you are better off with patronizing the fishball noodle stall on the opposite side located adjacent to the soya bean drinks stall."
Hawker Centre in the North
"Home to one of the older wet market in Singapore. Reasonably good prices to shop for seafood with excellent quality.

Aside from seafood, also good place to shop for dry goods and groceries. It's an old town that serves the immediate neighborhood area. Elderly and disabled accessible with ramps for people on wheelchair to get around.

Accessible by 856 and I would suggest coming here early when you can. Market probably starts from 6am onwards."

Toilets :- both from hawker centre and coffeeshops nearby need to be upgrade too.
Hawker centre also need to be upgrade further in terms of cleanliness n air circulation.
Bus stop nearby BLK 18 too small to accommodate many people awaiting for bus no.: 903(some far one bus  service ONLY)."

Small food centre. It has been around the longest time.
Overly crowded during morning till lunch hours and almost impossible to park at the carpark
Marsiling Food Centre has a Halal Nasi Lemak Stall selling Nasi Lemak at $2.50 only and it tastes like old kampong days.

"Love the Prawn noodles San Wan,  lion city teochew fishball noodles, the fishball noodle  beside soya bean. So many good food there. Wanton mee,  cheap chicken rice at the corner, so soup is not bad comparable to Yan ji soup. I used to work at the factory nearby.  My lunch there is my favorite pastime."
Assessable n wheelchair friendly..
Some pretty good food here. Location obviously not ideal and the hygiene is just a typical hawker centre standard.
"Everything also hv,cheap seafood"
"Crowded but still able to get a table around 10am.

With 4 malay foodstalls you're spoilt for choices and with an adjacent market selling at reasonable prices no wonder its fully packed most morning.
Many choice of food
lots and lots of local delights to satisfy at reasonable prices.
"I grew up regularly buying the homemade soya bean from the sole homemade soya drink stall here, and my favourite Muslim Food Stall's nasi rawon. It's a wonderful place to get local breakfast or brunch. There's very limited halal food options for dinner though."

You might not see a queue but they probably have several orders waiting to be fulfilled. The whole place was relatively empty with many stalls closed. Didn't get to try the bak chor mee that was raved about "

Abit crowded but get all that I need to buy.
This might not be the best hawker centre in Singapore but one of the oldest still in existence meaning the food here should be good and varieties serving one of the oldest estate in Singapore. Even though there are new breeds of hawkers but still serving those traditional hawker fare. Plus point being next to a wet market and rows of shops make this hawker centre a must go after marketing.

Old hawker center at Marsiling. Might need some face lift to modernize it. Nearby some shophouses so very convenient location.
"Sorry, because of the fasting month, I only went to this stall to buy the apam balek(pan cake) as take away for breaking my fast. This stall known as Uncle Pancake, that I have been patronised since the 90th was first situated at the kopi tiam next to old Marsiling  Market near the QIC. The pan cake was so soft and nice,  and remain that way even until at night. The uncle who run the stall is very friendly and courteous. He sold a varitiese of pancakes, but my favourite is the normal peanut, where he put a generous amount of peanut. I like to watch the way, the uncle cook, he will control the flame and rotate the pan to make sure that the pancake is evenly cook. He will cook it with passion and love gurantee to gave the best to satisfied the customer."

"This is one of the oldest wet Markets in Singapore. The floor is really wet and slippery, you need to watch out your steps. I always come here to buy seafood every week. The big prawns selling at upmost $15/kg in normal season, whereas other places could have been $20/kg, it is fresh and cheap . There is a stall selling Singapore vegetables. I like the sweet potato leaves which is uniquely purple in colour, it helps in your bowel movement. It will not turn yellow even if you keep it in the fridge for two days, whereas the Taiwanese one could have turn yellow the same day."

"I have been patronising this place since my childhood (when the bus terminal was located here). Some of the food have regrettably changed, while some others have left. However, the remaining old tenants still stand strong with a flavor that is not to be missed. Chin Heng noodle stall sells very good laksa and herbal soup noodles. The nasi lemak uncle (beside sin Yong kee fried carrot cake) has been operating since the market opened in the 1980s. The corner stall Bak chor Mee may have changed owner, but is still one of the best that I have tried (with their famous ""snow white"" fish cakes). The vegetarian stall is still superb after so many years. With a plethora of good choices with a solid history, there are also many alternatives in the numerous coffeeshops nearby.  I always miss this place."

"Handmade Fish ball mee pok at #01-11 is nice but portion is a bit small for me. I will definitely need 2 bowls.

Hor Fun at #01-28 is really something, Hor Fun Is fried by a lady when you place the order and a gentleman, her hubby ??,will fry the hor fun ingredients. Nothing much to shout about but it suits me fine, not so strong taste or heavy taste as Chinese put it.

There are 2 fish soup stalls, Marsiling Fish Soup and 169 Fish Soup (#01-01), personally I prefer 169. The belachan chilli goes well with the fried fish or fresh fish. The stall is also unfazed by the popularity of Marsiling Fish Soup... Hahahaa.. she said ""I am happy to have you as my customer."" Nope, she does not give me extra servings.  Well, I forward my thoughts based on my mood and NOT HOW THE STALL CORRUPT ME."

Old school food. Good food served daily
Very convenient as it is near the stadium and swimming pool. People can just drop by to eat and have theeir meal after of before exercise or swimming. Its a great pit stop before you goes home hungry.
"Old estate with variety of food to choose from. Parking was difficult as there were limited slots so we parked further at a housing estate. It was quite crowded on a weekend morning and the tables were not cleaned so we did it ourselves. The coffee and tea was ok. Tried Su Yuan vegetarian (not the one raved online) and the beehoon and zhai ee was not bad at all, though the mock chicken was far too salty. The black carrot cake was good and cheap ($2.50); well seasoned with not too much preserved radish. Masala thosai from the indian stall was extraordinary- fermentation led to a more alcoholic taste (which is not usual) and the masala was sweet and seasoned well. All the sauces had distinct tastes and was yummy.The thosai however is not crispy unlike how some would prefer. The noodle stall selling laksa and fishball noodles seem to be quite popular, maybe will try next time ;)"
I and my go there every Saturday. We are not the residents there. Most of the food there are delicious.
Good place this area.
Variety of food stall with cheap prices

"Joy Junction Wanton Noodle
Store No: #01-30

Had brunch at this food centre. The hawker food here is affordable and taste superb too.
I had char siew wanton noodle for $3 (comes with wantons) and top up for 4 pcs of wantons $1.
My hubby had dumpling noodle $3.50 , noodle with veggies toppings comes with 4 shrimp mixed pork dumplings inside a bowl of soup . The dumplings are pretty huge. I love the dumplings actually as I can feel the shrimps chunks when I ate the dumplings. There's always a queue whenever we passed by this hawker stall. Will visit the food centre frequently as I have yet to try other hawker stalls .."
"Marsiling Lane Food Centre is open everyday, except for when it is being spring cleaned. It has recently undergone a renovation which has seen its tiles being replaced to non-slip ones. The food served there is okay too, with it being affordable and nice. For example, a chicken rice stall there sells a plate of chicken drumstick rice for only $2.50, which is rare in Singapore.

The toilets are also well-maintained, and are washed daily. I would say that in comparison to other hawker centres that I have visited, Marsiling Lane Food Centre's toilets are better in terms of cleanliness. There is a 10 cent charge for using the toilet though.

The cleanliness of the hawker centre though, is a different story. The hawker centre is constantly flooded with pigeons and mynahs, due to the food centre being an open-air one. The tables are full of stains, and bird droppings, and rubbish like tissue paper and straws can be found everywhere on the floor. I have seen birds eating from bowls after patrons have had their meal.

There are Automated Teller Machines and shops nearby, so any groceries or money can be withdrawn after a meal."
A good hangout place for seniors to chat over meals
Good and cheap
"just few year since its opening, the cleanliness is dropped a lot. Most of Food price is higher than nearby kopitian with smaller portion. Quite disappointed  of this Hawker Centre."
I don't like the place dirty

No comments
Cheap and good hawker good.
"This neighbourhood hawker center caters for  workers from the surrounding area that has a numerous industrial estates during breakfast and lunch time during weekdays. Need less to mention during these meal time it is usually crowded and finding a vacant place would be a challenge. A popular store here is the Song Ji Seafood Soup store that serve a tasty concoction of prawns, minced meat, a choice of batang or pomfret fish cooked in a delicious soup. This is one of few store that are open for dinner till 8 pm."
"Food available there still taste OK.  But the prices for it is surely value for money.  It's cheap. Mixed vegetables rice cost u $2.80sgd for have 2veg, 1meat combination.   The handmade noodles also cost u $2.80 onwards. Is definitely filling enough as portion is relatively good.  Draw back is they close rather early. By the time of 7pm.  Most stalls are closed."
Good food at great price

"Old style wet market. Lively place. One of the cheapest in Woodlands I must say.

The closure of the Old Woodlands Centre brought some shop vendors over. And business for the place has increase.

I like the food here at the hawker centre.
The food stalls starts as early as 1am. Closes just before 10pm. Main eateries stats at 3am. They cater for the Malaysians and morning workers.
Somehow I hadn't understand is that why do they create so many competition between stalls. Although there are many varieties of food here but there are quite a few same stalls too! It's so bad for the business of the owners! That is the thing I always see in Singapore... Very sad. I don't see this in other counties generally. Might be an Asian thingy...

Anyway, I love my market and the hawker centre and the surrounding shops here regardless. Food prices are reasonable with some really yummy local varieties. Quite a nice few Malay food too. Wet market prices are pretty good if you know which stalls to purchase from.

There are some food I bought through the years. The epok epok was from Old woodlands centre, now at block 19 coffee shop next to the bus stop.

Latest picture of Kueh Teow and soup at the hawker side. Sept 2018.

Enjoy! :)"

Good and easy to operat
Old hawker centre but with new facelift. Fish and seafood is nice.
"Fish soup stall is popular and usually draws a queue during lunch time. Laksa and pork ribs noodle stall is also another with a queue. Other than those, nothing really special.
Update: New Taiwanese stall selling lu rou fan for the Taiwanese foodie fans to try. Not that I'm a big fan of that."

Need cleaning on certain areas particularly at hawker centre. Tables needs to be cleaned immediately after each customers left.
Had fried fish soup located near the provision stores and it is still delicious despite not visiting for a couple of months.
The prawn noodle I like was close. The LAKSA noodle also closed. Take the next best wanton noodle not so nice. Bought the butterfly I like and another Prawn noodle that is open for my son.

Thanks to the cleaner!!!"
Very convenient even though it was raining very heavily. But not enough sheltered walk ways from alighting bus stop to Block 19 my destination. So got wet. Otherwise it was a good trip. Google Maps worked fantastically well. But it's Singapore ! So I suppose it should work well.
Many variety of food..

Not vibrant
Nothing to eat there
There is a big food centre on the first floor. It uses AMR robots to bring used crockery to the central washing area. There is shopping on the second floor and 3 floors of parking.
Fail tray return planning. had to comb the entire hawker just to find the halal return area. Pls improve

Love the hainanese curry chicken with rice set
"Rumah Hunian dan Terapis, usaha instalasi CCTV driver rental dan UMKM Cake"
"Marsiling Mall in Singapore is a charming spot, especially known for its vibrant hawker centre. Located in the Woodlands area, it offers a variety of local food stalls that are popular among residents and visitors alike. Some must-try stalls include Ah Yi Handmade Noodle and Ye Lai Xiang Laksa, both known for their delicious and affordable dishes

The mall itself is relatively small but has a cozy, community feel. It features a Sheng Siong supermarket, which is open 24 hours, and several small shops selling clothes, accessories, and other essentials. The ground floor's open-air hawker centre is a highlight, providing a great place to enjoy a meal in a lively atmosphere."
"This Medical Hall is located next to Sheng Siong supermarket at Marsiling Mall. The shop sells mainly Chinese herbs plus both Chinese n Western medicine. You can also find freshly packed varieties of Chinese herbal soups and ingredients like red dates, wild berries and bird nests.

The shop owner is friendly and knowledgeable about general ailments to prescribe the appropriate Chinese herbs to boil and consume (if u are into traditional Chinese self-help treatment)."
It's a old school place
My family and i had a bad food poisoning after eat theree
It' s a small Mall. Haven't been  there for ages.
"My go to place for local, value for money soul food!

Great diversity of food, drinks and dessert choices. Majority are of great value and taste oh so homelyciously! Always satisfying. From Western to Mediterranean, the usual old school Chinese and Indian Muslim favs, and more.

Spacious and well ventilated. The centre aisle of seats can get a little warm due to the BBQ and hot soup stalls.

Read the other reviews for ideas on what to try.

My favs are the Arabica Kebabs, Western (Uncle Williams), Braised and Boiled pork soup, YanJi, and Satay!

Yums."
Neighborhood small grocery mall
Clean place. Capati is very good!!
"Good food...2nd floor seng siong...just great
Good food, all needs under 1 building.."
"++The stall selling soup facing the road was always long queue. They are close from Monday to Wednesday.
1. Recommend mobile phone camera remove for $20. (Shop name: HSE) second time there, good service. Third time the to put back the camera for $10.
2. The seafood soup is nice but alway very little. Too long wait for me. Will not buy again.
3. I recommend the cuttlefish kang kong very fresh and nice.
4. The herbal duck - not bad.
5. The Quan Long - wanton noodle and their Lor Mee with fried chicken chunk all very good."
Very good place. There is a hawlker center near by having Very tasty food
"Indian Muslim cooked food stall afraid to patronise aga8n, to much colouring additive."
Beef noodles mala soup is worth a try.
"You can get your groceries, meal here. There's also a pharmacy, burger king. Other shops that sells bedsheets, clothes, mobile shops and more."
"The mall ground floor has many food stalls, included vegetarian food stalls, very big hawker centre but seem not crowded. Second floor is retail shop , 10 mins  to go around window shopping, not many shopper too."
Very knowledgeable staff.
"The shopping area , very nice environment"
Nice place to have dinner beside swimming complex. Plenty of food stall to choose and some is very delicious food. Have to explore yourself what you like the most. The dessert stall selling very cheap dessert. Have to que each time.
A bit not much food to eat but got burger king on top and shops you can go walk walk
"Hawker food centre, fast food burger king"
Lots of different varieties of food and carpark spaces
"Not sure if it's my unlucky day but their standards have dropped for the stalls I bought my meals from - prawns were not fresh (slightly mushy even after being cooked). Kaya toast, though understandably took longer to make because of high orders, were being rushed which results in the butter still being iced cold when served to me. The worse is that they dropped my pack of Kaya toast on their wet floor in their stall right in front of me.

Just a caution for those who want to have their meal on a busy Sunday, or maybe I just xiaoxuay on this day"
awesome place
Hawker centre have 3 vegetarian stall. Nice food. The Google map show only 2 vegetarian stall. The Shan Xing Zhai not in the map.
"This is so far the best double boil soup i had! the soft bone is so soft that u can just eat it! Forget about those fake collagen soup elsewhere, this the real thing! Oh ya, it opens on thursday to sunday while stock last! #01-03 there u have it!"
Standard hawker centre with a few good stalls
"Love beef soup by Yassin
Tulang at mama stall"
"Great place for good foods as many stalls are previously from the old Woodlands Centre. Like the laksa, fried carrot cake, fried kway tiao, roasted pork, seafood..etc

Parking is easy at the mall or at the open space carpark which I personally preferred. Do beware when parking at the mall back to back parking lots as my parked car backside was hit by another lorry backside. See photos."
"Best braised pork leg (Amoy style)
Teochew braised duck 2 stalls away not bad... Must grab their chilli paste and chilli garlic mix (power) ... Garlic is fresh"
"The foodcourt has a good variety of food. The place was tidy, and it was well-run by the foodcourt operators. The upper level. with shops, was also a good place to visit."
It is a place to taste some local food and to buy groceries. Change money.
Can use CDC vouchers as payment
"Hawker Centre at level 1 has many stalls, worth visiting because many varieties of food, Chinese, Malay, Indian, Thai, Japanese, Korean etc. Reasonable pricing.

Newton Roast Chicken stall has closed"
Not enough toilet
Plenty of food stalls to choose from
Nice asians food can be found here..
Good place to shop after 8pm shop still open
"Cleaner when collect  utensils from return rack and throw into collection trolley innot gently put it in, she just throw very hard and last for at least few minutes into the collection trolley and we just sit beside her. I don't know today she is no mood or is her work altitude?"
"Visited this mall to have coffee and meal at the ground floor hawker centre.,with friend. The layout is old school with a twist, literally. In the evening this place is patronise by old timer. Carry over from the old place of woodland centre road area. Which were demolished many donkey years ago.
THE second floor is the mall proper. Many tenants are of the old aforementioned place. You can get household items, watches repaired, handphone shop - selling and repaired. This level is not crowded in the evening. A good place to chill and shop."
Many familiar shops from the old hawker center opp woodlands check point. But rather pricey for the food and drinks in general
Why are there so many stalls selling fried carrot cake here  Otherwise its a place with a decent selection of local flavors and is situated in a quaint and tranquil neighborhood.
Variety of food. Not so crowded. Ventilation need improvement especially at centre area. Ordered western food kids. Taste quiet bad actually. Oily fries.
"Clean & spacious hawker. Many stall and budget food.
My favourite stall is Gao Ji Shu Shi recommended by my friend. Best nasi lemak i have ever eaten. The green lemak rice has old school taste. Drumstick is juicy and crispy. They even cut the drumstick for easy eating.
Impressed by their food & service!"
Troublesome to reach
"Excellent food choices, cheap and good at the market hawker centre. Sheng  Siong supermarket on Level 2 Groceries are cheaper than NTUC."
"Lots of stalls,
But many close,
dinner time not pack ,
Price same as normal neighbourhood stall ,
Price acceptable,
Taste okay but some portion acceptable only
Not coming back unless nearby ,
LVL 2 totally feels like old 2a woodland Hawker,
Reach LVL the sewing machine oil smell n store lay out bring back old memories"
"Some of the shops are from the old woodlands interchange.

- they have clothes alteration shop
- they have DIY shops
- hawker at the ground floor"
Local shopping mall...
Not many HALAL Muslims and Chinese food varieties. Suggest big departmental store such as METRO.
"Wonderful place. Went to the new Superpets store on 2nd floor for some pet food. Visited shengsiong supermarket to get some groceries. The prices of many essential items have gone up. For example the price of two broccoli used to be $1.88, but now is going for $2.68. Similarly, the price of a pack of nuts containing a mix of cashew nuts and almonds nuts is now going for $5.45 when it used to be only $4.50. Inflation is real. As crowded as ever."
"Wo Qu Na Li Jiu Chi Jian An Zhu Chao Tan,Shi Wu Gei Duo,Huan You Jie Qian Gong Dao,Huan Hao Chi,Zhi De Qu Chi. "
"Quite boring but after all its an old neighbourhood, coffee shop downstairs has alot of varieties of food, upstairs is mainly shengshiong and a burger king, a KCuts in case u need a haircut"
Value Hub Stuff so rude to Customer
"Still one of my favourite location as we can have usual wide variety of food at level 1 stalls or Burger King at level 2. After that we can head over to Sheng Siong to get groceries and stuff, trim hair or seek phone repair or buying shops."
"First floor with hawker center, second floor with burger King , song seong , and some home atore"
I tried this Lele chicken wing fried rice and the fried rice is my ideal type. The chicken wing flour taste quite good and the chicken bigger than i expected and probably if they maintain this standard i will be back often. The only thing might expect waiting time as they deliver fresh one.
Loading bay unfriendly
This place.... Hmm Like goes back to the past.... But lot of food options
Spoilt from choices and variety of food
Not many stalls open during Sunday.
No much shop
Choice of good food. Have go and try.
Still prefer the old Marsiling
"Nice Ah Seng lotus soup, bubble tea, and fried oyster."
Old shopping mall with basic stuff on the 2nd floor
"Jin Tian Wo Qu Da Bao Chao Xia Mian,Fa Xian Dao Xiao Fan Chao Xia Mian De Ren Hen Bu Wei Sheng,Wo Shi You Shang Wei Sheng Ke De Ren,Wo Hen Huai Yi Chao Xia Mian De Xiao Fan Dao Di You Mei You Shang Wei Sheng Ke?Chao Xia Mian Yi Ge Shou Na Guo Chan Yi Ge Shou Na Chi Fan De Pan Na Lai Chao Xia Mian,Shi Hen Bu Ke Yi De,Huan You Na Su Xiao Tong Lai Zhuang Chao Xia Mian De Tang,Zhe Ye Shi Bu Ke Yi De Xi Wang Neng Chong Shi Zhe Xie Wen Ti,Wo Ye Shi Yi Ci Jiu Hao Liao,Yi Hou Wo Shi Bu Hui Zai Guang Gu"
Great selection of food and quality of food is generally consistent. However it is on the pricier side with a full meal at least $4.50 or $5. Hopefully can implement budget meal like I have seen in Tampines Hub Hawker
Still need to vibes. Good food and mixture
Lots of great local food here too.
Seafood Soup
"The bian mian stall, there is a lady is so rude and dumb unable to answer my question. Small bian mian $3.50, medium bian mian $4.50 and large bian mian $5.50.
I ask her, what is the different of 3 sizes. She is so dumb and deaf never even want to explain to me! Is she a boss, she not fit to open this stall. And her cooking bian mian is not that standard. Too salty soup in noodles. If she think salt is too cheap. She is harmful to customer health. I will make a report to management. Rude attitude and deaf lady boss."
Just go there to do the monthly grocery. Food stall at ground level.
You can all things in marsling mall got sheng song supermarket
Many varieties and big potion
"Came here often coz working nearby, OK, quite alot of variaty of food, can be warm during hot days."
"you wont be able to find  baby chairs in this hawker. take note if you come along with toddler or baby. Foods wise are still okay. price is reasonable. Take note if you require an empty bowl or plate for your children, 10 cent of cleaning fee will be charged accordingly."
Love most of the food at this hawker center...
Cheap and affordable.
Many choices of food
Experiences from halal stalls. Courteous sellers. Friendly. Generally better taste prata (and gravies) and Chapatti (and gravies) from other places I visited around Woodlands. Toast bread and hald boiled eggs never disappoint me too!
There is a kebab stall at the Muslim area. I have been eating the chicken kebab with rice. It's 7 dollars with huge portion. I think it's actually enough for two person super nice!
Not all shop open daily.
One of the good places we go to purchase school shoes at affordable prices.
Huge selection of hawkers on the ground floor. Supermarket and small stores selling clothing and phones on the second floor.
"i love the hawker food here! old shops above which sell all kinds of stuff like body & hair care, clothes, beads, etc. as well as a sheng siong in the middle"
Food at the hawker centre on the ground floor is pretty good. I enjoyed it. 
A neighourhood shopping mall near to MRT and sport complex in Marsiling.

"Swimming pool, stadium, Marsiling mall and gym"
Nice place

"Tried their mee goreng, mutton steak berkuah and rojak.
They always maintain their standard with their Mee goreng. We like their gravy. As good or better than one @ Yishun."
The portion is big for 2 people. Very nice. The pig skin is very tender. The Bak Ku Teh is very nice too. The meat is tasty and just nice. Strongly recommend 
"Red wine chicken mee sua. Not bad.
Toast set. Not bad."
A lot of food stalls!
"It's a nice place to dine in with a lot of food that is delicious. On top of that, after eating, u can go walk on level 2 to digest your food. You will probably find a lot of jem in it."
Escalators are moving on the wrong sides...driveway and carpark poorly design...lifts too...
Nice place !
A nice place to eat but shops are limited.. many handphone shops in level 2.. very malaysia feel.
Pretty good variety of food.

"Shocked. Why Habib Express @ Marsiling Mall closed recently? What happened? Their food is delicious. Really will miss their Mee Siam, lontong, nasi lemak, Maggie goreng & sambal tahu. "
"The size char is from the old Marsiling center. The food is  good, homely and the price is reasonable. They don't make aesthetics fare, it is kinda old time and makes you feel back to the 80s."
Toilet got ghost

"For grocery shops since have sheng shiong inside and not so many shops. Its more on houswhild shops, alterations and groceries. Below is the hawker center."
"Arabica Kebabs is a must try, and the mall has a satay stall as well, though I can't quite recall the exact name of the satay stall...haha."

Ample parking. Good foods.
"Went to Walk Around shoe store on the second storey to purchased my walking shoes. I had been patronising Walked Around Shore store since 1995 when the store was at #B1 Peninsula Shopping Centre. There was this  newton Hainanese Chicken Rice on the ground level hawker centre. The chicken was soft, rice taste fragrant just like Tian Tian Chicken rice, but I bought takeaway  the plastic box had a cracked at the base of the box and the soy sauce and Sesame oil leaked into the  carrier. The chicken rice (small portion) is Real hainanese style, the chilli sauce was garlicky and spicy which what chicken rice chilli should be for hainanese chicken rice in Singapore"
Not too busy place.
Went to Sheng Siong to buy an iron. Thankfully it was open when it was almost midnight. Staff are helpful and friendly.
Great varieties of good food and prices are super reasonable
Love to have lunch here. many options and well ventilation. Two vegetarian stall and Thunder tea rice is niceee!
Best mall ever.
Food patrons of the old Woodlands Food Centre can enjoy their local cuisines here. Same foodstalls for some  nostalgic ambience. Good food on ground floor. Sheng Siong supermarket on 2nd floor. Burger King is also in 2nd floor. Spacy with ample seating places.
Nice chicken rice and sugarcane
Pangit siya na mall tapos yung burger king branch doon ang bagal mag serve ng pagkain. Hindi siya fastfood super slowfood sila mag serve.

"Relatively new shopping mall in the Marsiling Area, the residents who usually relief on the Causeway Point shopping mall, can now have an easy and closer access. Though shops are not quite large in variety as the later big mall, they offer lower priced commodities with a good quality."
"A neighborhood mall which is also just beside swimming pool, badminton court and stadium. Many choices of hawker food stalls with wide variety of very affortable food. Well ventilated too, do not feel hot at all.  There is also burger king, Sheng Siong and a few shops at level 2 if you want to do some shopping."
Hen Duo Mei Shi You You Chao Shang
Can find many old woodlands central stall here
"Like dining at the back end of the hawker centre.

There's fried hokkien mee, a reasonably priced mixed vegetable stall with a variety of dishes, Thai food stall, a nondescript looking meehoon kueh stall that serves up good fish soup as well.

Be prepared to queue during peak hours, but I feel its worth the wait."
Nice place to sit and eat
There are so much variety of good foods
Good hawker food to visit
Solid selection of food at very good prices.
Many choices of food
"70 plus hawker stalls, Chinese, Muslim, Indian, vegetarian food, spoilt for choices. Second floor, Sheng Siong supermarket, burger king, clothing, shoes, clinic, hair cuts, essential items, phone shops, money changers, all under one roof."

"Nice curry chicken,curry pork ribs and curry mutton with french loaf."
Reminds me of the good old Marsiling food centre and market. Place is busy with people buying old stuff like denim jacket and pants. Level 2 Sheng Shiong. Level 1 is the food centre. Only missing is Sheng Siong's 4 for $1 otak-otak
Lots of variety. Big spaces. Will go again.

"Neighborhood mall, plenty of food shop at ground level."
There are lots of food choices.
No favourite stall
Love the porridge here...unit #01-10
Some good food can be found at the hawker central there
They are shops from the old market area near Woodlands Chkpoint. Sheng Siong is also here.. Hawkers - varieties of food available
Nice place to meal
A lot of food..dont know how to choose already so many choices
"Located between Woodlands and Marsiling mrt station, this mall has a large hawker centre with a great variety of foodstalls at Level 1. At Level 2 is the Sheng Siong Supermarket and a variety of individual shops selling clothes, bags, household items, mobile phones, etc.. There are also plenty of car parking spaces at Level 3 and 4 for those who drive. Overall, it's a great place for those residents living nearby to dine and buy their essential items."
"A new hawker center in woodlands with many old hawker stalls relocated from the old woodland hawker center near the causeway. This place is easily accessible by bus and have a multi stories carpark. There is also a Sheng Shiong supermarket on level 2 and other shops that sell clothing, accessories, chinese medical shop, fast food restaurant (burger king), and others. Visited the hawker center to buy my favourite Char Kway Teow and coffee."
"Many food choices. My go to hawker especially when there's sheng siong in the same building. If you grow up going to the old Woodlands interchange, then you might reminisce a bit of the vibes.

Kebab, Indian rojak/food, roti John steak. Halal western that's affordable and nice!"
Wasn't terribly impressed with the food selection here. One Lor Mee stall had a long queue.
"Nice place to shop for groceries, kitchenware, home appliances, clothing....etc..reasonable food prices at the hawker centre...not to miss..all in one Mall."
Have a lot of nice food over here. 
This is kinda like a new shell but an old core. New mall but the tenants are from the old woodlands centre. Not saying that it is bad. It's a good initiative to preserve such retail culture.
" Many choice of old traditional food stalls. The hawker stalls surrounding breezy and well ventilated.  The Super Big Fan make the place less hot and warms. Especially noon time, you enjoy the food more comfortable ."
"You Ji Pin Le Sha!!!Jia Lian Wu Mei De Na Zhong!!!

"slightly above average in ambience, varieties of shops."
"Mostly cheap aunty and uncle clothings , bags and accessories can be found here too! Also value shops and shoe shops"
Variety of good food at the hawker centre
Alot of local food.. nice.. try it out.
"The arrangement for the stalls is a bit confusing, it's a nice & neat place to dine."
"CANNOT TRY SO DONT BUY ANYMORE- On 24 Sept Bought a pair short pants at 02-29 Chew Fatt Fashion (CFF) asking for same waist size that I bought here about 2 months ago ! Upon trying the shorts at home found it to be much bigger than the previous pair bought here ! That time I dealt with the aunty here is nicer... This time i bring back shorts bought next day I deal with an Uncle ask him get another same size or smaller as the Company making this shorts tends to have errors in manufacturing as I been buying this brand of short pants for more than 5 years so I must always try it before buying but this shop has no changing room, they wont allow trying at nearby toilets even if i leave my phone or bag with them! So we can only try after buying which is quite risky! Another place which sells the same brand at least has a small spot with curtains where we can try before buying! He gave me a size smaller but after trying at a toilet nearby found it a bit tight! So I ask him give me same size but Another color since the color I had chosen has no more sizes I want! Finally he got me same size which turned out to be the size I bought 2 months earlier! Which means the Size I bought yesterday was labelled the wrong size of the waist ! He said if this 2nd piece I try cannot fit then ""I take care myself "" meaning he cannot help me anymore! I think it's a very irresponsible way to treat a customer!!! Yes I Finally got the correct size of short pants but saying ""You take care yourself if 2nd pair cannot fit shows how much responsibility he will take to help customers find the correct size!"" What if I cannot find the correct size or it's all sold out ??? Does it mean I'm stuck with a pair shorts that doesn't fit me and $18 is thus wasted ???!!! Very bad attitude and irresponsible to say "" You take care yourself if this 2nd pair cannot fit ! He should say that he will try find a pair that fits or make a refund if all the sizes fitting me are sold out !...That should be the words and attitude of a responsible Shop Owner ! From now I will not buy from this shop anymore because they don't allow trying especially for pants it's harder to find a fitting pair if trying is not allowed! Unlike Shirts you can just try it on in the open ..."

Hawker centre blocked. Mall rather new n peaceful.
Feels like jb

Many good food in hawker centre to choose from. Many stores were from OLD Woodlands Bus Interchange.
"Nice place esp with Sheng Shiong, Burger King & off course the Hawker Centre. But should have more relevant shops instead of cheap clothing stores"
"Tried the vegetarian stall (Hong cook food) for lunch. The food is soul-less. It's just for filling stomach and don't expect it to be tasty. Tried the nasi briyani as it's a Friday special. It's really not worth mentioning. Ordered the mixed vegetables as a side, also not very appetising in terms of colour and taste. Disappointed but guess if I'm back here again,I have no choice but to try the stall's other offering."
Convenient place to do your groceries shopping. Food court is clean
Hao Da Shi Tang.Shi Wu Duo.Shang Dian Ye You..Hao.Hao.Hao.

Lots of variety cooked food sold here. 
Nice hawker centre
"Good variety of food, the place is not too crowded. All the food have certain amount of standards as they were all shifted from the market at the checkpoint there which have exist for very long already. The total damage for a family of 5 there was $20. The lormee have abit of queue but worth as the queue moves fast and the noodle is not bad. The place is not stuffy or hot like a lot other crowded coffee shops it's well ventilated. There's still a good size Sheng shiong, old shoes stalls and Burger King upstairs. Parking is easy too"
"Level one is a hawerk center.The Shop houses at level two is limited. There is one big Seng Shiong supermarket, a very spacious Burger King, a few retailer Shop"
Nice place and good food.
Quiet place to do groceries shopping
"If you remember the old Woodland Centre , near the CIQ and present KTM ticket counter, almost all the shops and hawker centre allocated at this Mall.
Located beside Woodland Public Swimming pool and stadium, its a very good stop by areas with varieties of hawker foods.
The Chapati with keema and the Arabic rice / kebab are the food that you try !!"
"Many hawkers at L1 actually moved from ealier Old Woodlands Centre near causeway. Halal or non-halal, sure can fill your stomarch, yummy.

At L2, the ShengSiong supermarket is the main anchor-tenant, BK Burger King and many shops of different varieties."
Nice place to lepak
Limited shops. But big food court with many varieties
Long q for ah cheng lao Huo Tang but it's good! Worth a try if not too long.
Good place for shopping daily needs and with variety of foodstall at level 1.
Good place to eat and shop. Will be better if the shops there open longer hours rather than only a few shop left open when visited
"Support Kim Hee Leng nasi lemak #01-50
Freshly fried chicken wing, egg and hotdog upon order. Rice is fragrant too"
"Food is so-so only.
Location is incovenience for those staying in Woodlands n Woodgrove area as a distance away from Woodlands n Marsilling station."
"My go to place for shopping and food. This place is a treasure trove of good old traditional food. This place also houses several tailors that can help with your clothes alteration. It is fast, took only half an hour. Lastly, it has a large Sheng Siong for all of your grocery needs."

"Good variety of choices for food, family friendly and CDC voucher accepted."
A variety of delicious food and the availability of sugar cane juices stores
Sheng Siong supermarket at 2nd floor. Hawker center at 1st floor.
"The food center is hopeless especially the last 2 goreng shops. They charge 20cents for additional plate. Food quality is poor , too much salt and oil. The staff there gets angry when you tell them to lessen oil or salt."
Lots of eateries downstairs and upstairs is Burger King and Seng Siong supermarket
Lovely places and great foods 
Waiting grap
"Quite basic, time for healthy living malls. No fast food."
"MSCP parking,

"Lots of nice food ,from Malay ,indian and Chinese food. My go to when I crave something"
Pretty good place to go for food and some grocery shopping. Though the location is kinda out of the way.
Nice place and enjoy!
"Nice place ,lot of food stalls and 24Hrs Super market
Mobile shops are also available"
Neighbourhood shops on the upper decks. The hawker stalls on the lower deck. Overall a good concept to have 'mall-ish' concept to have the services and shops contained in a location. But probably can make this nearer to the residents.
They have a hawker centre there. Should try the food there. They are delicious.
Market price with mall infrastructure
A lot of nice food
"You Chinese,Indian and Malay food more over there sheng siong super market above"
Lot of old thing to see and lots of food
Lots of foodies
Nice food n soup
Hawker centre and mall all in one place
Hen Hao Ya
Nice and easy for you guys to see if you wanted to come over and watch the kids on the phone with her and see if they will accept that as well as the other day
Nothing is worth for a visit here.
Go earlier if you want to in the night or else closed
"Next door is police station and sport hall.
Seafood rice stall is ."
Mall is ok. Not much shops there. Below hawker centre. Not much variety of shops
"Food, food, food & food!!!
Various varieties of food! Cooked food or DIY food!
Be spoilt for choices.
Need clothings, furniture, pharmaceutical supplies, hardwares or hair cut? Almost everything also have!
Get healthy afterwards by exercising in nearby swimming pool, jog@ stadium or play badminton!
Else, stroll at level 2 for your personal marketing either for food or daily stuffs.... Still hungry? There's a Burger King!
No WiFi, afraid not.... BK & WIRELESS@SGx is available!
Enjoy!"
Liked the spaghetti
Variety of food Choices
"One of those places where u can do the usual stuff in the heartland. Eat, cut hair, grocery shop, etc... Parking is a little wonky. Especially the spiral driveway up which may be a bit challenging for some. Lifts are slow and busy. Patience required."
Good to visit for food n sports items
hawkers centre.. very poor air ventilation.
Difficult to find seats
The nearest to my residency that some food are reasonable cheaper plus also have my wife & myself taste too.
"Don't be confused by the name, as Marsiling Mall is different from the typical shopping centers around the country.

Don't expect brand names as local mom-&-pop shops are the norm. You can find household items, off-brand apparels, traditional medicines, electronics, and even a tailor.

There is a Burger King, the only chain you will find here amidst a clinic, barber, and a popular grocery store.

Some retailers (on the second floor) are from the shops of old at the demolished Woodlands bus terminal near the causeway. So are some hawkers at the food center on the first floor."
friendly people
Good variety of foods n drinks
"Foodcourt/ BK fast food- Good!
Shops- Good!
Do drop by if you are around the corner "
Very small neighborhood shopping mall
"A heartlands shopping center on the upper floor with Sheng Shiong. Ground floor homes the hawker center. Food choices are pretty good!

And for those who misses Malaysia, the shopping area could give you the Msia vibes, quite interesting!"
Good food for all races...nice place to chill
"Compact yet has everything that I need ... food, accessories and groceries"
Handphone shop at corner is good place for repair/ buying. Staffs friendly. Looking for affordable boots also have . . Below Western food also to try. Reasonable price and taste good
"Our favourite food stalls -
1. Kang Kong Cuttlefish (You Yu Yong Cai) by an old auntie (now has assistant), followed and patronized her from original stall at Old Woodlands Checkpoint until moved to Marsiling Mall Hawker Center. 
2. Yi Duo Li Handmade noodles (Yi Duo Li Shou Gong Mian)
3. He Cheng Cheng Tng (He Cheng Qing Tang)
4. Yanji Seafood Soup"
"More shops add to more choices and varieties...anchor by shengsiong..shoe shop, watches, clothing, money changers,  home accessories, burger king and not to mention posb atm"
"If you are looking to buy school shoes, there are several shops on level 2. Sheng Siong available as well."
Huge provision shop and supermarket.
Very nice place
There is really nothing special to say.  Parking  All kinds of food are easily and cleanly available.
"As l told previously, more than 2yrs since CoViD 19 started, it's that l went there about 3wks ago if l'm not mistaken. Roughly the Marsiling Mall was close( nearby  ) 10/ 15 minutes walking distance frm Marsiling MRT. The scenery was quite different from other., Y not ,all of us can go there if u wish to!"
"Lots of variety for makan. Level 2 have lots of small small shops and shing sheong to buy things. If ya want a 1 stop to do jt, can come here"
Other than makan i don't know but the makan is good and a lot of variety especially Chinese food.
"There're plenty of stylish clothes that are up to date, and afgordable. Besides that u can find Shengsiong it's kind of huge too, and 3 HP shop. Besides that there's a food court that serve varieties of dishes which will make u drool and eager to test them out. The stall owners are friendly, and provide assistance for the choices of foods that's most popular."
Still cannot sit 5 people in one table.
"Neighbourhood shopping mall that is walkable or you can take a bus from Marsiling MRT.
There is a hawker with many food stalls at Level 1.
Level 2 has some stores like phone repair shops, tailor shops. There's a Sheng Shiong at level 2 as well.
There are stores necessary for residents living around the area, but not sure if it's sufficient.
I will probably only come here for food and not again"
"It's quite convenient for humble family dine in place where u can get a very humble western choice, beef noodles, Indian Muslim foods, drink stall n desserts as well."
"Quite big Hawkers Centre with some shopping, there is a Sheng Shiong Supermarket"
You can find all kind of home appliances in cheap rate
Amenities and groceries could be found here
Very nice and cosy place to dine. I think all the hawkers that wish to continue their business move here when Woodlands checkpoint was closed down for renovation. Very affordable food with new tech of paying and don't have to bring wallet to have Hawker Centre food. There is a 24hrs Shengsiong for late night shopping and a Burger King outlet that is nice and deserted for hanging out.
Good malay western food.No beef items all chicken .so no worries for those who dont consume beef.Its halaal
Good eating place
Nice n Good!!!
"Di Dian Huan Xing,Mei Shi Bu Cuo,"
"Marsiling Mall is old but has a good hawker stall, 24 hour Sheng Siong, a clinic, couple of pharmacies including a TCM one. There are also shoe and clothes repair as well as key duplication stalls. Burger king is also here. Overall a good convenient place."
"I thought it was a mall but nothing much here except first floor which has big food court and second floor only one eatery which is Burger King. Shengsiong supermarket at second floor and few other shops which HDB shop type.

It was hot during the noon, there was barely a seat at lunch time at the food court. Quite a big food court, I think it might be 40 over stalls here. A lot of seats were marked as non-seated seat because of  the safe distancing. The food itself is good. Tried few stalls and it was nice but I forgot that I eat hot food during the afternoon and it was a sweaty experience.

They could enhance more of the safe entry at the lift, the traffic in and out were blocked because they have to queue on safe entry upon exit."
I personally like the chee cheong fun and porridge stalls there. Suggest that patrons should try.
"Lots of nice food here, if drop by must visit"
"Many variety of meals. One bad things is the bird dropping. We gotten bird dropping on our face, after a bird fly pass ing above our table."
Clean and spacious. Food price quite reasonable. Lots of good food available.
"The mall is improving with the crowd, and foodcourt still little opening only for two per table."
A lot nice food
"Most shops from old woodland centre, if you miss the people there, places to go then."
Great place for hawkers foods! Cheap n good!
"Not much of a mall, with Sheng Siongas the saving grace"
If you been to the old Woodlands Checkpoint shopping arcade you will know that most of the shops were from there. The vast difference is that now it looks cleaner and the food courts serves more verity of foods.
"The value hub closes earlier (9pm) than stated on the website (10pm).

If you need help don't bother asking the staff, they don't know anything about their products.

Don't bother if you didn't do your own research about the product you actually need. The shop doesn't accept paywave..."
"Near to my homeground,friendly services n clean too"
Cheapest hawker centre in the northern area.
Find my cat food
Wide variety of food
"This is my favorite hawker to go to in the north area. There are plenty of affordable and good food options. However the opening hours of the stalls are somewhat irregular. I go there mostly during evening time, but I often found many of the stalls to be closed. Not sure if they were opened only during breakfast and lunch hours or were just closed for the day. It would be useful if the stall could put up a notice of their opening hours/days."
"Enough stalls and seats. 2nd floor has sheng siong, so it is convenient. Wontan mee, Porridge, laksa and mee goreng good."
"Many local delights sold here.
Favourite - Prawns noodles,Thai food, porridge Cray fish noodles and many more."
"This is a new mall that was built to accommodate the hawkers, shop owners from the now demolished Old Marsiling Centre. The Sheng Song is at 2nd level, many old shops are there too. Ground level filled with all the nice food that are frequent by the Malaysian workers who used to stop-by after crossing the border."
"The mall ambiance is very bad ,"
Find Madhi rice and Kebab is nice
Plenty of shops.. clean and aired. Food (halal)  was good too!
Good hawker food. Plentiful choices
"Affordable hawker center in the North of Singapore, serves a variety of food. Get the Teh Tarik here!"
All your hawker food here
"Varieties of foods availables here ..
Though its a Mall but the foods stall are Hawkers Ctr style ...
Price are all reasonables ..."
Food there was delicious
Lots of choices for food. 24hrs Sheng Siong...
"A taste of homemade Pan Mian with homemade fried shallots! made by former stall owner in woodlands centre hawker (next to checkpoint)... only frm $3, an affordable meal with good taste of ""homemade"". only something missing the soup does not comes with the dry pan mee."
"For its size, I think its got more ""heartland utility"" than its Causeway Point bigger cousin up the road.
The hawker centre comes surprisingly with some quite good stalls"
"For motorcycle rider what you all need raincoat..windproof jacket all there..mostly the venders from marsiling old market..the food there not bad at all.
What you need is there..the best part if you goner replace you old zip and buy a new one' there is''..for Jeans,jacket,etc"
Best place to get cheap and good food
Awesome food
Coffeeshop full of great food but many old retailers seems to be missing from the old marsiling
It's well maintained and clean 
Just when to the food court. Improves a lot with more stall and delicious food to eat.
"Nothing to shout about, rental high, hence food price high, don't park yr cars upstairs, park next to stadium wh is cheaper!
Food just average like elwhere!
Upstairs shopping not special, only clearance stuff of 3rd world standard!"
Good find.
I  quite like the local food there.
"Still awesome like always, yummy foods and friendly store owners. For a hawker centre, it is really great already so I would recommend."
Nice community place
"Marsiling Mall is always my go to place for coffeeshops as the amount of stalls there is insane. You can get almost anything from there, with many different drink stalls. Special highlights to these two stalls, worthy in terms of price, portion and taste.

Do note tho, during lunch and dinner hours, super crowded and may be difficult to find seats. And the stalls usually closes quite early, between 830-9pm"
They handle a missing item issue professionally and politely.
Good food ... but always crowded.
"Variety of hawker food at level 1. Some are nice. Has a shengsiong supermarket at the upper floor and several small shops including those selling mixed ware like household tools, light bulbs and led lightings, cutleries, chopping board, and etc. Parking is at the top storey, carpark entrance from rear of building. Main entrance of building is road facing."
"huge variety of food there, cheap and yummy:]. the block 166 chicken rice is really really good too. a total of just $4.50 for additional rice and chicken:] the $3 normal one on its own is already quite a decent portion^-^ recommend to check out that store."
Shi Wu Ji Quan
"Just too many choices till U do not know want to eat what, Alamah."
"20th Aug 2021

Honestly it's a joke can't find seats during peak hours when there's so many seats but covered. Management covered more than half the seats when this period already have to clear own plates and utensils and when people who are not considered ""fully vaccinated"" yet even after 2 shots cuz the vaccine only take ""effect"" after 2 weeks, this is one of the few places to dine out Literally see people walking around with their food tirelessly looking for seats. Just ridiculous."
Great selection of food
Small and quite boring
"Sad to see stores closed or closing early...went there at 1 pm on Saturday.
Guess even with the new rules for dining...its still affecting the hawkers and not viable for them to spend the day being open.  "
Good supermarket sheng shiong and hawker ctr
Nice moderately crowded  neighborhood place.
Well maintained
I love the hawker food
Spoilt with many food choices here. The mix rice was really good.
My favourite stall
not cheap extra .50. to 1.00

"A walking distance from MRT Station, is a food centre with a open space smoking corner 3x, food variety is great
Shop is upstairs
A convenient place"
"This place has a huge hawker centre at ground floor with lots of stalls and quite a number of popular ones. One end of it, is a range of halal stalls. A decent carpark space from level 3 and up, with three lifts access (only issue is that one lift is separated by a glass door). 2nd floor has a Sheng Siong supermarket, Burger King, money changer, tailors, phone shops, TCM shop, shops selling clothes and household stuff (there are those old timer shops from Woodlands Centre Rd where you can get raincoats, worker clothings, towels and some cheap cheap bags or pouches, etc). Mall is situated in between Woodlands and Marsiling MRT stations. So more convenient to go either in car or bus (there is a bus stop directly in front - unsure what buses available). There is also bus stop at the back of mall near the stadium."
"Hawker centre at level 1, shops and Sheng Shiong 24hrs at level 2. Carpark level 3,4&5."
"The first hawker I ve seen with nursing room awesome. The self tray return is in place with tray return stations, but seems the machine is not working and the staff advise us to return manually. Overall this hawker is clean and many varieties of local food, and supermarkets at upper level, the parking was convenient."
Great place to find cheap and tasty local delicacy!
Awesome delicious street food from Five Star Fast Food. We had Mutton Steak $6 with soft banquette bread & White Fried Bee hoon with fried anchovies  Refreshing drinks 
Hawker Centre food stall number 39 & 40 awesome
Place is clean and spacious. Mostly selling hp and clothes and shoes
"Theres fast food burger king here, shengshiong outlet here has so mny varieties too. Below there are many delicious food stalls including halal beef brisket hong kong chinese style noodles. Power lah
I love this place.

U can also find cheap affordable everyday clothes in front of sheng shiong. $5/$8"

Can find old marsiling-checkpoint retailers here. Brings back old memories but in a new building.
There is a hawker Centre below with the greatest seafood soup there.
Feels like walking down memory lane of the old woodlands town centre shops.
The Mall nice
Best place to get your kueh chap and banana fritter.
Food court. Hawker ctr. Multi storey parking
"One big Sheng Siong is here.
Many neighborhood style shops around"
"Can be improve with more food stall
But so far is okay nothing great"

"1) Lorry at the trashed area causing air pollution,  feels uncomfortable while taking meals at the store near the vicinity

2) car park entrance near the trashed area, room to improve,  lorry should avoid queuing at the area causing inconvenience to visitors drive in to car park during lunchtime."
Local Hawker stalls with one grocery store and other shops.
Absolutely loved the authentic Hong Zao Ji by hao jia stall. Still taste the same despite having to buy back (no dine in allowed until pandemic gets more controlled) Yummy!! 
Excellent hawker centre for the man in the street.

"It's a hawker centre at L1 and Sheng Siong supermarket at L2. Lots of good food, however need to be there early. Otherwise some stalls eg. dessert stall will be closed by 8."
i love this place
Shopping mall is very big with not much of choices.The most outstanding is Sheng Siong Supermarket for shopping convenience.
Not many shops
Good place for food and leisure.

Nice to fine food

Long queue... and expensive
"Quite a small mall but still have a number of stores like clothing, bags, shoes, supermarket, etc... The main attraction might be the hawker centre at lvl 1. Lots of food stores available."
Food is good and shops are limited.... Carpark ramp up abit small and tight...
Many nice food
Still need more time and awareness on the tray return.
"Always a pleasure visiting here! Love the variety of delicacies and lots of seats. First floor is a Hawker centres and 2nd floor has a optical store, Pharmacy, hardware store, craft shop for knitting, crochet where the aunty teachers you as well. Lots of mobile stores that offers repair and other services."
A wide variety of delicious hawker food at affordable prices
"newton hainanese chicken rice (NHCR) at #01-46

rice is quite fragrant, not too oily
chilli is spicy!
love the ginger
chicken is juicy and soft

v affordable at $9 per half chicken"
Good Hawker food. Spacious burger King. And a few small buisness shops.
Plenty of food stalls. Carpark is especially full during lunch time and evenings. Motorcycle lots still can try to find at upper level. Can be accessible by lift. Quite a few halal stalls closed on Monday. There is a large variety of foodstalls to cater the various ethnicity. There is a Burger King at  2nd level and also Sheng Shiong.
"A good place to go, have hawker center at level 1, fast food & sheng siong supermarket at level 2. Some other shops sell various things too."
Lots of yummy food available and parking space
I like chicken rice and the toilet feedback is so good. U cant give negative review but the machine accepts positive review. Haiya
"Good place for shopping and food!
Tenants from old Woodlands centre road."
"Like the porridge from here. Thai food also good, mix veg rice good and affordable. Now more good shop here."
"Shi Wu Hen Duo. You Hen Duo Hao Chi De Shi Wu.

Yummy lunch at Yan ji
"Don't like the smell in the food court.
There is a 24hr open Sheng Siong "
My best neighbouring eatery place
Good to come here off peak. Else everywhere also got queue.
"There's a Sheng Shiong Supermarket on Level 2 that runs round the clock. For fast food lovers, there's a Burger King on the same level."
The Indian food is good
Great selection of food at the hawker centre. Newly opened fish cake stall is a must try.
"Spacious and well ventilated, the ckt opposite dessert store for $4 portion wise is pathetic"
I love this place because the shop vendors are mostly from the old Woodlands town near the checkpoint. There are so many foodstalls to choose from. There is a big houseware shop that sells many household products. I had breakfast at Burger King here.
"A lot of delicious stalls and lots of seats. Sure to find food u like. Only bad point is they charged $0.50 for every tray u used , so that u will return the tray and get your $0.50 back."
Favourite Burger king
One stop eating place

Delicious food over there especially the Chinese store nasi lamak
This place is crazy with tonnes of merchant selling good food at cheap price.avoid lunchtime as it was crowded.
"The wonton noodle stall #01-65 allows people to cut q if you are ordering only a single item. People lined up behind ordering 2 bowls or more will be served first. Do not waste your time here if your time is precious to you. There are many better wonton out there in Singapore, don't need to show big eye vs small eye. Will not return."

How come the bean curd from the dessert stall was so sour? It was very unusual.

Love the indian stall...like to have a bowl mee kuah when visit marsiling mall.

Good food and friendly vendors.....
I love this place because it is convenient and has good food downstairs and a supermarket upstairs. It indeed is a good place
Li Mian You Hen Duo Mei Shi. 
"You can almost find everything that you need under 1 roof; chinese medical hall, fast food outlet, variant of hawker stalls and Sheng Siong supermarket; which I enjoyed the most for my daily groceries shopping."
Quite disapointed. Anout 1/4 of the shops are closed  Hawker Center stores too. Probably business is bad during COVID hence affecting them.
Great place for old school shopping that are very affordable... alot of sizes as well. Cheap shoes and slippers. Most shops and hawkers are from the old marsiling... sheng siong open 24 hours and they even have 2 chinese tailors there for alterations etc.
"Amenities are adequate with the Hawker Centre and sheng siong and a few stalls with different vendors selling various household items. However, there needs to be a better lift service or some other way to head to the carpark levels. There are only 3 lifts in service and it is always a long wait from level 2 the car parks."
"Many local food choices. Better if there is any famous stall to attract the gluttons.
Sheng Siong mart is inside. Can do a shopping before or after meals"
Hawkers center with a  shopping mall.... All different kinds of foods around... Chinese.... Indian n Muslim stalls
"Good sheng doing market.
Sugar cane juice good. Near jelly shop.n parata good"
Nice place
Hot and stuffy.ventilation blower is noisy
Many food choices. very convenient! :)

No  a good experience at Pharmacy here. . . . . . 
"Yi Lou You Hen Duo Hao Chi De Shi Wu,Wo You Qi Xi Huan A Cheng Lao Huo Tang. Er Lou Ke Yi Gou Wu"
lotsa food
Yummy pork porridge. The best ever!
"Xing Zhou Zhi Chao --- never eat here, ever, no matter how attractive looking the pictures of the food look on their board. I ordered a plate of san lou hor fun with sliced fish for $5. What I got was a plate of gooey starch poured onto a pre cooked pale hor fun, white tasteless pieces of steamed fish and beansprouts. All the man 'cooked' was to add some starch flour to a scope of water in the wok before pouring the gooey liquid onto the plate of pale white hor fun. He did not even bother to stir fry the hor fun and slice fish even once yo give it some flavour. The only colour on the dish is from the green of tge spring onion! The entire dish looked so unappetising. It was tasteless and with zero fragrant! What's worst, there was no one in the queue at all and it was not as if the cook/ stall were rushing any order! For $5, I felt so disgusted by such dishonest hawkers. These people gives hawkers who makes an honest living with actual cooked food and Singapore's hawker UNESCO certified culture a bad name."
Many good hawker stalls. There is a sheng shiong supermarket upstairs too
Tried coffee next to delisnacks is good. Laksa in this market is good.
A little silence during the night.
There is my favourite cane drink there
Lots of shops and food varieties.
overall nice place
Good variety of food

"The beef noodle stall was good! $5.50 for this. Good broth and tender meat. It wasn't the MSG kind of sweetness, didnt feel thirsty afterwards! Will be back for this again :D"
Had breakfast at BK here at level 2. Generally quiet so its a good place to do your own work and have a quiet time.
"I like the masala flower crabs very tasty and the price is reasonable ... nasi lemak worth the value, $3.50 you got fried chicken & 2 pieces of samba prawns & 1 fried egg"
"A lot of former stalls from Woodlands Town center market and stalls that is being relocated to this new revamped market place with food stalls and some shots front at level 2.
A burger king is also at level 2 which satisfy residents and consumers who visited this mall."

crowded in the weekend food so so
"Lots of cheap and good food to choose.

The only issue is the hawker centre is supposed to implement tray return with 50 cents deposit system, but the central tray return machine is not operational.

If you were to buy hot and soupy food, you have to carry it with your hands without the tray. Using the tray, the hawker will enforce 50 cents extra even if the tray return machine does not work."

Very dirty. Be careful of birds roosting above whilst you are enjoying your meals. They might poop into your dishes.
Many variety of local food. Cheap and good. Hawker centre is clean.next to Stadium.
Nice mall to do bargin shopping and delicious food available

Only the hokkien mee good
The Hokkien fried prawn noodle is out of this world with its gravy and self-made chilli! Ask for Lian Xiang!
"Insufficient parking/tables, lift slow, congested place to go"
"Nothing much there, only supermarket, BK, few stalls of clothing stores and a wide range of food choices"
Varieties of food
SHENG SIONG Supermarket available at 2nd Floor. Also can get handsome items. Food Court available at the 1st Floor. The food is tremendously GOOD.
"Lots of seats, not as crowded as some other hawker ctr"
One of the stall that sells Chinese style lasi lemak that located at level one! Cheap and nice!
Typical neighbourhood mall with hawker center
"Great place to buy affordable footwear, including safety shoes, waterproof boots, formal wear, sport shoes and even school shoes  #02-50"
"Comprehensive variety of shops, supermarket, and a Hawker Centre conveniently located just down below!"
Brings back memory lane.
Food is not bad
"You can find lots of superb food here. My personal favourites will be hokkien mee and beef noodle (halah). Many varieties to choose from, but i find that there are way too many drinks stalls; just the middle section alone house over 6 drinks stalls."
"The shops are average. The food centre at lv1 is pretty good tho, lots of great food"
"Love it, v windy. No birds, alot of food"
Plenty of parking spaces available. The food in the food court is delicious
"Food centre is excellent, serves a big variety of very yummy local food, I'm sure this place appeals to all foodies, multi-storey car parking is so convenient within the mall."
"There is a small scale shopping mall on the 2nd floor to the hawker centre below. The hawker centre boosts a great variety of delicious and popular local food and the place is reasonable airy and spacious. I was surprised the mall upstairs is air conditioned and there are quite a number of retail shops selling essential goods e.g. household products, Sheng Siong, shoes and a couple of restaurants. It has all the essentials you need for residents staying in Marsiling."
Spoiled by the choices of foods available here.
Was good.  Went to celebrate a relative's birthday!  Quite a lot of variety of food there.

Not too bad
Not so interesting place. Can be better with more shops variety
Place is clean and the food is nice price is also reasonable.
many food to choose
Alot of diff options for food.. nothing is great here to reccomend.
"Come here mainly for the food.
Quite a number of varieties to choose from.
Will always patronize the Nasi Lemak stall which is directly facing the lift lobby (Run by a Chinese couple).
Dessert stall along the same row. (Run by Old Chinese couple, patronize since Woodlands Centre Hawker)
More options; Fish soup, Mee Hoon Kuey, Hokkien Mee and alot more.

Muslim friends; there's a whole row of Muslim's stalls on the right side of the Hawker Centre.

Downside, have to bare with the table cleaning, as the cleaners have a large area to cover."
Good stuff here
"Not much shops in the mall unless u need to shop for gocceries, do some alteration on your clothing.  Nice hawker center on the ground level,  a must eat is the soup store,  the prawn noodle and the HK Cheang fun store"
"Lots of cheap pants and bags. When have sheng siong, money changer"
"Many food choices and it is near the stadium. The location wise is so so , but it is easy to find. Love Beef Noodle the most...a must try for those who love Beef soup "
Everything under one roof. Excellent. Wonderful shopping experience. I'm loving it!!!!!
Need to improve the lift(slow)especially during peak period(lunch/dinner)and weekends.
"Combination of multiple highly rated food stalls like seafood soup, hokkien mee, carrot cake, char kway teow, on the ground floor + convenience of Sheng Siong and large general supplies value store on 1st floor make this a good one stop eat and groceries place."
"A back to basics kind of shopping mall in the heartland catering to everyday needs such as daily necessities and provisions. There is a Sheng Siong Supermarket and a fastfood restaurant, Burger King. On the ground level is a hawker centre serving myriad of local dishes."
"Hot food, hot temperature, just hot.."
A relatively new good center.  Many hawker stalls but mostly average.
"Hawker stalls on 1st floor, supermarket (Sheng Shiong), Burger King, hardware, alteration, clothes/shoes, handphone shops on 2nd floor. Basically, old woodlands minus 50% of the shops and100% of the vibe."
Good to buy groceries as Sheng Shiong and variety of food was sell at d food stall.
"Located next to woodlands stadium and neighborhood police office, first bustop from woodlands bus regional interchange (187,966,960,856,ect can ask driver bus for assistance).

There was a recent promotion with coupons and online ordering. I was there on a weekend for lunch with the family. I have to commend the staff members as there was only two of them around managing the whole place and online orders. The wait was long (about 45 mins) but the two staff on duty managed to pull it off. Good promotion but understaffed.
Great Food Choices
Has shengshiong hypermart and food centre.
This is a new mall in Woodlands New Town. It is along Woodlands Ave 3. This mall is the resettlement of the old Woodlands Town Centre and you can see most of the old tenants from the old centre continuing their business here. I came to replace my watch battery. I am one of their old customer. Cheers and wish them a good business.
Varieties of delicious foods and price is reasonable
"I ordered the youtiao-only rojak and honestly, it was quite disappointing. The youtiao were over-charred -- you could see the burnt bits, and the chaotah taste was just too much. It completely overpowered everything else.

The sauce didn't help either. It tasted mostly like sweet soy sauce, lacking the usual balance of flavours you'd expect in a good rojak -- no real tang, nuttiness, or spice."
"Rojak is 4 *, enjoyed it.
Satay (Pork) 1 *, never had such salty satay before, suspect it is not that fresh... $1 / stick for little portion of meat, & gave lemon quality meat...maybe its a one off event but please do some QC before serving."
"Both satay and rojak are good. Rojak is not overly sweet. Had pork, chicken and mutton satay. Pork satay had little fat.
As we were sitting 3 tables away, they were kind enough to bring the food over to us instead of self service."
"Fantastic Rojak
Especially love the thick sauce,mutton and pork satay are great too."
"Bought from stall around 4pm, not many people ordering so got the food quite fast.

Looked forward to the rojak but was disappointed. Rojak had almost 6/8 pineapple chunks,1/8 youtiao and 1/8 tau Kwa/other ingredients. I personally would prefer more youtiao in the rojak as there was way more pineapple chunks then rojak which made it taste like a pineapple peanut salad instead of rojak, the youtiao present was also cut very very small. Hence the youtiao was almost nonexistent. The rojak sauce is also quite light and not heavy, watery type of sauce instead of the very thick one.

On the other hand, satay is good, peanut sauce is flavourful and thick which I like, satay meat has the touch of smokiness to it, mutton meat is slightly tough while chicken meat is quite tender. However, cucumber tasted very stale like it was stored in the fridge the day before and taken out to serve again, not the freshest tasting cucumber.

Overall, would only recommend to go for the satay and skip the rojak unless you prefer more pineapple/fruit rather then youtiao in rojak."
"What's great?
Rojak sauce is mixed well. Century egg a good top up. Lots of turnip given. Buzzer is available, so no need to hang around and wait.

What's to improve?
Nil.

Visit again?
Yes! To try out their cuttlefish and satay."
There was this japanese lady. She was so kind and the rojak they even allow me to eat with rice and taste so good
Satay and rojak sauces were nice. The cuttlefish has a nice charred taste.  Kind service. Enjoyable experience.
"Went to have rojak at Marsiling mall, found this stall and the stall owner was super friendly and of cause the rojak there is very crispy and the sauce for the rojak is quite special , there is a taste that you don't find it elsewhere, want to know what taste? Try it yourself "
No queue today. Had the normal rojak. The you tiao is grilled and crispy. The fruits and vegetables in the dish are fresh. The sauce is a little to sour for my taste of how rojak should be. Service is fast but very transactional rather than friendly.
"$1 ea for satay, tender n not overdone. Do come down and try"
"A good option for rojak in the far north. Their rendition of the dish is to me on the ""cleaner"" side. The sauce is not very sweet; light touch with the hae gor; and they've also included torch ginger flower. Interestingly the sauce also seemed to have bits of what looked and tasted like softened raisins! The amount of sauce was just right. The ingredients felt very fresh - when i first took a bite the taupok and youtiao were warm and crispy and the pineapple was chilled. Pineapple was sweet, as was most of the guava (or was it green mango?). Turnip and cucumber were crunchy and juicy. The only issue i had was that the astringency of the pineapple started to hit me halfway through, making it rather uncomfortable to eat. Perhaps giving the pineapple a quick grill would resolve this! Photo shows the large portion, which was generous - i was happy with the amount and portions of fruit/veg and youtiao, although youtiao lovers might want to consider adding more youtiao."
"$4.50 small portion rojak is very worth, lots of crispy youtiao and the sauce is refreshing and not too sweet. Satay is great too."
Fan of satay. Happy to see a satay stall that serves satay during lunchtime.  They also have rojak.  Will try it next time.
"i came all the way from bedok to try the rojak plus cutterfish and century egg. you tiao also crispy. very yummy. statay also nice. i like mutton but it is spicy, maybe because got pepper. My wife and I like the rojak. we will come again"
"Rojak with taste different from typical, more to sour type..
You Tiao all too small pieces to get the Kou Gan.
But I love their century egg.. confirm pungent ..
$4.50 rojak small.
$1.50 century egg."
"Delicious and tender, coupled with that aromatic 'char' smell of the satay. Truly living up to their name Mei Xiang. One of the best in Singapore!"
Delicious satay.
Their youtiao is crispy and sauce is nice. Just the sauce like too little and rojak abit dry. Else it's very delicious.
Very nice and crispy rojak! Power!
Best rojak I ever had. Shiokkkkkkkkkkkkkk
Best satay and rojak ever! So good that it makes you want to eat it every week!
wow the rojak was super fresh. everything done right !
Cuttlefish and century egg rojak ($8.50) - Average. The flavour of the sauce could have been stronger and thicker. The portion was small. Even the cucumbers. The cuttlefish was not bad. The century egg was fine.
Observed the satay meat shrished this time as we ordered regularly when we are there. Fruit rojak are fresh and portion small.
Charcoal grill You Tiao Prawn Paste superb Peanuts crispy balachan HOT
Thank you again for the lovely satay and rojak with chargrilled cuttlefish! It was such a treat for us after a long day!   
Both satay and rojak are excellent.. Friendly service
Very addictive rojak
Came here to check it out after watching Ghib's youtube video. Zhen Cai Shi Liao. Rojak and peanut sauce were gao gao.  Shiok!
"Our all time favourite satay and rojak in the whole of singapore, consistent and always a pleasure ordering for our lunch.    love the friendly and efficient service especially Godon and godon wife are truly a charm."
LOVED THE FOOD! AND THE STAFF WAS SO FRIENDLY 
One of the rare few shops that has an assorted options between satay and rojak. They make the satay fresh for every orders rather than giving a precooked one. Absolutely delicious and worth trying for the affordable price!
"Good food, repeat customer. Satay sauce is superb."
"Decided to check out the hawker centre at Marsiling mall as I was in the area and chanced upon this absolute gem of a stall.

The owner was friendly and extremely professional, and even though it was peak hour, the food came quite quickly.

I really enjoyed the satay, with its smokey aroma and succulent meat which was delicious especially when paired with the peanut sauce. Definitely recommend the the crispy taupok and rojak as well.

I learnt that they are a third generation hawker in Singapore from the owner too! Definitely check them out - and support local hawker talents while enjoying a great satay experience in the north."
"Went there recently and tried their cuttlefish rojak + their satay! The staff there were friendly. Even though we went during dinner, they gave us a beeper so we didn't need to stand and wait at the store. (Especially thankful for that so I didn't need to stand around and wait or keep checking whether the food is ready)

The food was really good and my favourite was the cuttlefish rojak!"
Quite decent wanton mee
Leaning towards more old school type of flavour. This is with added noodle.
Says 24hrs. Wasted my journey
Serving varieties of noodles. Their Wanton Noodles is good and cheap at only $3.50.
"Chewy noodles and very satisfying meal, soo worth it for the price"
Can use CDC vouchers as payment
"Massive place.
Like giant MRT station without trees,
which makes noodles & plates smaller.
And oblique characters of stall
Tasty Q noodles & hae bee chilli
petite but umami wantons & fresh dumplings
Large cavernous stall, full kitchen to roll wantons properly
Lots of untapped potential"
"Noodle not soggy but not chewy either. Acceptable. Char Siew taste . Soup is nice. Sauce is . Wonton is alright but just not the traditional type. Taste different but acceptable. For $3.50, it is reasonable. Can try if you are heading there. Hard to find place to seat. So go off peak hours."
Your standard wanton mee. Service is fast and fuss-free.
"Bought one set to takeaway, the portion is pretty good. They are not stingy with the wanton, noodles and side ingredients like vegetables. Probably one of the better Chinese noodles food in the hawker."
"Nice wanton mee, with sufficient level of spiciness and dry lean meat of char siew. Soup was flavorful and meat in the wanton is generous. They accept Paylah, Paynow and Grabpay. Could be better if the noodle is more springy. Price is very reasonable at $3.5 per set."
Loved their chicken feet noodle and soup. Also the stall is very clean.
"Best wanton mee and mee pok
No friend wantons but the noodles and sauce is great"

Hidden and unique find in woodlands. Wish there was more Burmese food in Singapore. Love the strong flavours.
"The best Warm Tofu Rice Noodle ever eaten in SG's Burmese food stalls. Chewy, stringy rice noodle topped with thick, warm and nutty tofu paste, crashed peanuts and minced chicken meet with chilli perfectly goes well with tangy, spicy and rich flavors.
Shan noodle (Rice noodle salad with minced chicken meet in Shan style) is pretty tasty too with generous portion of meet.
Both dishes come with chicken broth soup as a side which can be tasted rich and chicken broth with no msg included. (MSG is one of the seasoning which most of the Burmese food stalls use).
Burmese fried fish paste salad also delicious with chewy fried fish paste mixed with onion, fish sauce, lime juice, coriander, tomatoes and red chilli give your taste buds a kick of sour and spicy refreshment. This dish with warm white rice is a must try which goes very well with.

This stall is run by a friendly and good-cooking Burmese aunty who cooks and prepare every dishes with her heart prioritising cleanliness, hygiene and being able to give best taste and quality of every dishes served to her customers and making sure that her customers to feel like they are home eating traditional dishes which represents the meaning of the stall's name (Mother's House- ame'aim)."
Good Myanmar food! The portion is quite ok and the price is reasonable. 
"Came here for the tofu nway but it was sold out. Tried my luck and asked for lahpet thoke,  (fermented tea leaf salad) , even though not on the menu, and the owner happily obliged. She served me a really huge plate for $6 which needs to be shared.

Indeed it's one of the best I've had in SG. It's not oily at all, not overly strong in smell nor too acidic, there is a slight sweetness that takes off the edge. Very well balanced in the 5 tastes. I would recommend asking for it!

Couldn't finish it so had to pack the rest home for further munching. I will come back to try ginger salad (gin thoke) and rice salad (htamin thoke)."
"Brought my Myanmar helper here to try since it is nearby civic centre. Thought she would like it. But we ordered item no.3 and the Shan Noodle was even too salty for her. Flavourful but the portion was small. The saltiness overpowered all the other flavors. At $6 for the shan noodles, I expected better. Nice that there is the side condiments. The powdered dry chilli is very potent. Please aplt with care. I wanted order item 6 but was told the menu rotates daily. Dishes 1-5 today and then 6-10 the next day. So be prepared. Full menu not available. There are better choices elsewhere."
"I've been eating at this stall for a few months and today I got free meal as a loyal customer!
Thank you Mother's house. Your food is always delicious."
The food was amazing! Had many famous dishes of Myanmar cuisine and it showcased the warmth of home very well! Food was warm and delicious with the service people being amicable.
"Ordered #3 Shan Noodle, #5 Nan Gyi Thoke and Lahpet Thoke (tea leaf salad - not on menu but learnt from another reviewer to ask). Food quality is extremely good - you can taste the freshness of the ingredients. Every dish was well executed.

Special shout-out to the ladies running the stall. Honest-to-goodness hardworking folks. Thank you for the lovely meal."
"My friend brought me here! It was my first time trying Myanmar cuisine. I got to try the Shan Noodle, Nan Gyi Thoke and the Warm Tofu with Rice Noodle! The portions were big! They were all so good and I can't wait to try more! The auntie was very nice too"
Tasty burmese food ever
went there for dinner as i was nearby there. reach arnd 7:30 and they only have a few options left so i tried shan noodle. the portion was good and fast too. it was kopitiam vibe. the side dishes were also good as well
"Soft tofu with rice noodle, $5.
A soft paste with peanut scattered. Rice noodles similar to korean glass noodles.
There is a bit of chilies for a kick.

It's a good introduction to myanmar cuisine.
I will be back to try the Coconut laksa - monday only.

Different noodles are available on different days."
"Oder garlic noodles. Fried garlic smell very nice. Give me a good appetite to finish the noodles. Pricing ok public pricing.
7  Nov order Today special Myanmar Laksa. Frangrant with coconut smell. Nice and yummy"
Taste good. Portion small.
"Newly opened myanmar cuisine in woodlands. I would say this is the best Burmese food in town. We tried garlic noodle and nan Gyi thoke. Tasty and just like home cooked food, the portion is big compare to other shops. The lady boss and the staffs are friendly too. Worth it."
"This is a newly opened Myanmar Cuisine at an industrial park area. We tried the Nan Gyi Thoke and the Shan Noodle. The Nan Gyi Thoke is really nice. The minced meat very flavorful and goes nicely with the noodle. The Shan Noodle is a bit on the sticky side and flavor is not powerful enough. Food wise, I think it is a 5 star.

The name of the stall is Mother's House and the dishes also true to its name. We had the same Nan Gyi Thoke on different days and it is slighly different - once it has some crunchy stuff and another time the crunchy stuff is missing. The portion also varies a lot from serving to serving. I think as a stall selling food to the public, the dishes need to be consistent in term of taste, ingredients and portion. For this inconsistently, I gave 4 stars.

This is a new stall and still need to fine tune its manufacturing processes. Find that the process of ordering and paying is still quite messy.

All the best! I am sure you will work out the kinks soon!"
Prata crispy. Mutton curry is powdery. Better than average.
Love the crispy prata
"I have been here several times for breakfast and love it every time. You order and are given a number which will be called on a big display. The gravy is thick, flavorful and sometimes there is a piece of mutton or large potato. The prata is indeed very crispy. If the wait is long, don't worry since there is a kopi stall and they come around to take an order. Just sit, people watch, enjoy your drink, and they are usually fast to get your prata to you."
"You won't go wrong with their prata, it hasn't changed for decades ... it is well worth the wait ..."
Pretty nice when I went a few years ago
"Kopitiam buzzing with so many people, mid-tasting drinks by the the prata is soooo good"
"The prata, as its name suggests, was amazing. However, the service was not as good as we expected, but the feeling of shouting at people brings you back to the 1980s experience.

The place was a little hot, but feels pretty reminiscent.

Overall, a nice experience."
Fluffy and crispy prata. So good!
"After hearing a lot about this place, we went for breakfast on Sunday. The wait time was around 45 mins. But the stall next to it had good Kopi, which we had while we waited.
Excellent crispy pratas (plain), the egg one became a bit soggy. Both the fish and mutton curries were super! Personal preference was the mutton curry!
Definitely would come back for the crispy pratas!"
very dirty and bad attitude the India Woman hand very dirty
"the prata here is honestly really good - fluffy and fresh. but the aunty's attitude is just terrible. she's so unfriendly and snobbish, probably because the stall is so famous now and it's gotten to her head. a simple smile wouldn't hurt. also, please be consistent - don't pick and choose who gets the sambal. when i asked for sambal, she muttered something under her breath. i even saw another customer complimenting her prata and she completely ignored him. what's wrong with her?"
"One of the least oily egg prata I had, crispiest for sure both top and bottom, fluffy egg filled. Coin prata looks crispy too. Worth the wait!

Coffeeshop is airy, there was help to get a table."
Brilliant pratas!
One of our favorites.  We always make a stop here when in Singapore.  We debate if the coin prata are better than the traditional.  We love them both
"I finally understood why locals and tourists alike travel half the Singapore to eat this. It is really super crispy and yet light and fluffy. The fish curry is thick and rich and adds extra punch to the prata. If you are in the vicinity and have yet to try it, this is not to be missed. My favourite roti prata."
Not too busy for a Monday morning.  Maybe a 15min wait. Outstanding Roti.
"M&M Prata was quite nice of course although quite a bit of a wait. Good systematic queue system, could sit down and wait for our number to appear.

However, AVOID the drink stall!! The drinks are terrible, WATERY and expensive. That aside, the attitude of the drink stall wait staff was giving money-grubber and asked if our kids wanted any drinks like Ribena which we know would cost us $2 and above for a bottle.

The kopitiam owner is a man with a wispy Long white hair and beard and gave us strange looks when we first walked in."
"DO NOT BUY Drinks from the coffeeshop you can check out the review on the shop, the worst and most diluted overpriced coffee/tea. prata is good, hawker is very nice and they also knew the drink store is a SCAM"
Ok I have to admit ... the Prata's are the best in the East . Humbled .
"Located in a corner coffeeshop in Joo Chiat, the prata is nice, but be prepared for long queues which will start to form from 7am onwards."
"This prata stall is the SAVING GRACE of this coffee shop - the only one worth visiting for. The prata is crispy and fluffy, even if you order the egg or cheese variations, they manage to make it soooo fluffy and not greasy at all. They always get super busy on weekends (for good reason) so be sure to come early!

Definitely in my top 3 prata places in Singapore."
"Love the prata. The fish curry is particularly good. Ambience wise - well, it is a coffeeshop that is decent enough."
"Very crispy and tasty pratas, friendly owner"
"Gave 3 stars for atmosphere as the small coffee shop gets crowded on weekends/public holidays, making seating hard. However, the prata was excellent -- crispy, fluffy, and worth the wait. The fish curry was also delicious."
"I tried both the plain and egg roti prata, and they were delicious! The plain prata was super crispy and satisfying, but the egg prata really stood out -- soft on the inside with that perfect mix of eggy richness and flaky texture. It's definitely my favorite. Served hot with curry, it hit the spot. Highly recommended for prata lovers!"
The best prata in the East!
"This prata shop serves a perfect blend of crispy and soft textures, with a flaky outside and a warm, chewy inside--just as a good prata should be. However, they often run out of dough by 11 AM, so go early to avoid disappointment!"
"You get the good old auntie who may ask you repeatedly in a rushed manner what you want to order, and then call you 'sayang' (a Malay word which means 'darling' in english) and ask you to sit and wait for your food.
The roti prata was so crispy you'd hear the crisp when you cut it through with your cutlery. The curry was delicious and not too watery, it enhanced the flavours when eaten together. Please be around for as long as you can Mr & Mrs Mohgan!"
"If you love prata, this one really must try. I had the plain kosong prata and wah, confirm crispy until shiok. Outside super crispy, inside still soft and chewy--just nice, not too oily also.

Made fresh on the spot, best to eat hot. Dip into the fish curry and even more shiok. Old-school stall, but taste really top notch. Will come back again to try other types--maybe egg or coin prata next time!"
As local as you can get in SG
"Our go-to prata place--the coin prata is a must: crispy edges, getting softer around the center.
The curry is mildly spicy, kid-friendly, and often comes with bonus potato or brinjal. The sambal belacan with ikan bilis leans savoury and pairs perfectly with the curry--dip both for a heavenly bite.
Come early; after 8am on weekends, waiting time can hit 45-60 mins. We usually arrive by 7-7:30am for a short 10-min wait. They accept PayNow; but drinks are cash only."
"Egg (or go for a double egg) prata is still the best here cuz they manage to get it crispy. Many other places can't do even a slightly crispy egg/double egg.

I'd skip the plain/kosong, which feels more like fried biscuit."
"One of the best pratas I had in Singapore, the egg prata was crispy on the outside but fluffy on the inside. The curry was good too!"
"The food is just average but reasonably priced. There is better join else where in Bedok or Thomson.

The coffee and drink are horrible. Pls don't order."
"Not only crispy, but flaky too! Pastry like, very nice. Been quite long since i last eaten prata with this texture. Colleagues like the mutton curry, but too mutton for me. Fish curry taste great and not watery. Perfect."
"Mr and Mrs Mohgan Roti Prata: A Joo Chiat Institution - The Egg Prata and Fish Curry are Pure Gold!

Mr and Mrs Mohgan Roti Prata in Joo Chiat isn't just a prata shop; it's a culinary landmark, a place where tradition and flavour collide in the most delightful way. For those in the know, a visit here is a pilgrimage for prata perfection, and for me, their egg prata paired with that incredible fish curry is nothing short of legendary.

Stepping up to their humble stall, you're immediately greeted by the rhythmic flipping and sizzling of prata on the hot griddle, a symphony of culinary creation. There's a no-nonsense efficiency to the operation, a clear indication that they've honed their craft over years of dedicated service.

The egg prata here is, quite simply, exceptional. It's not just an egg encased in prata; it's a masterful layering of dough, stretched thin and cooked to a perfect golden-brown crisp. The inside remains wonderfully soft and slightly chewy, providing the ideal canvas for the rich, perfectly cooked egg within. Each bite offers a delightful textural contrast, the shattering crispness giving way to the pillowy interior and the satisfying richness of the egg.

But the true magic, the element that elevates this prata experience to another level, is their fish curry. Oh, that fish curry! It's a vibrant, flavourful concoction that strikes the perfect balance between spice, tang, and a subtle sweetness. The aroma alone is enough to make your mouth water. The curry has a wonderful depth of flavour, clearly simmered with a careful blend of spices that tantalize the palate without overpowering it.

The combination of their crispy, eggy prata dipped generously into that luscious fish curry is pure culinary bliss. The textures play off each other beautifully, and the flavours meld together in perfect harmony. It's a comforting, satisfying, and utterly addictive combination that keeps me coming back time and time again.

The legacy, spirit and flavour that Mr. Mohgan so lovingly cultivated continue to thrive, thanks to the unwavering dedication of his wife, Mrs. Saroja Mohgan, and their team. It's clear that she is carrying on his legacy with immense heart and a commitment to the standards that made this stall a Joo Chiat institution.

While the focus is undoubtedly on the prata, the efficiency and friendly service of  Mrs Mohgan and the team contribute to the overall positive experience. There's a genuine warmth in their interactions with customers, a sense of community that adds to the charm of this Joo Chiat gem.

If you're looking for an authentic prata experience that goes beyond the ordinary, Mr and Mrs Mohgan Roti Prata is an absolute must-visit. Their egg prata is a masterclass in simplicity executed perfectly, and their fish curry is a flavour bomb that will leave you craving more. It's a Joo Chiat institution for a reason, and a testament to the enduring appeal of well-made local delights.

Highly Recommended!"
"Food was good
Best prata I had taken in SG with authentic curry gravy
Efficient service
Atmosphere was coffee shop and occasional loud shoutings of drinks order"
Having the popular Mr/Mrs Mohgan prata. One of my favorite prata in Singapore. Flaky and crispy pratas with a sour fish curry. Totally worth it despite the higher price point nowadays.
"The coin pratas, crispy & tasty."
"Inarguably the best prata in Singapore. The prata was crispy to just the right about (not too Crispy that is breaks) and the fish curry is tangy and flavorful, the sambol is cherry on top.
Waiting time is probably less on weekends post 11am"
"This is a popular hunt for breakfast. Over here every piece is always crispy when served. Normally I will go for plain ones & add several more with egg or onion.

Once u had placed your orders, simply find your seats & wait for your number to be called. Service was actually quite swift, probably could order a drink while waiting for your orders.

The fish curry was homely & hearty, an excellent match with the crispy prata. Not to worry, the spice was mild, can even drink it on it's own. Had couple servings everytime when patronising her stall."
"Must visit if you like crispy hot roti Prata!! However, it is on the pricier end in comparison to other roti Prata stores. $5 for one egg Prata and two plain Prata."
Our favourite Roti Prata in Singapore
"Best roti prata I've tried yet. Queue can be quite long, though. Be prepared to wait a bit."
"all-time favourite roti canai in SG
Self service"
"ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING ATTITUDE.
From server and the old lady.
So arrogant for what?
You create your own luck."
"Zhou Ri Zhi Xu Deng 10Fen Zhong,Gang Chu Lu De Re Re De,Tai Bang Liao,Sui Ran Bi Yi Ban De Gui Yi Dian"
This is an institution that needs to endure! A stalwart in this neighborhood holding up the prata: croissant ratio.
"Have been hearing about this place for the longest time, but each time I arrive, I will see a long queue and the coffee shop fully packed.

So finally my friend and I chose to come on a weekday morning, where there was no crowd or queue.

We proceeded to place our order. For me, I got the basics of 1 plain and 1 egg prata. To me, knowing whether the place serves a good prata is that they can get the basic prata right.

We got our order not long after, and on the first look, it looks like any other prata. However, upon wanting to tear it up, you can hear the crisp of it, and that's where you know the name super crispy prata comes from.

It is not so crispy, unlike some places where it's like biscuits, its balance of crispness, and it being fluffy is just nice.

Now let's not forget the curry, and I must say the fish curry that came with it was definitely to my liking. Some fish curry can be a bit too sour, but this has a nice flavor and spiciness to it, goes perfectly well with the prata.

Overall, it was definitely a good set of prata, and I will definitely come back again, but maybe not on a weekend"
"Prata egg was crispyyyyy yo!

The coins prata is small in size but satisfying to the tummy!! 

My to go prata shop next time!"
"Cash only. The coin prata and fish curry combination, especially with a bit of sugar, does the trick and then some!"
"Mr. and Mrs. Mohgan's Crispy Roti Prata is truly one of the best in town!  Every piece is perfectly crispy on the outside, yet soft and fluffy inside - just the way a good prata should be. The buttery fragrance and delicate layers make each bite irresistible.  Pair it with their rich, flavorful curry, and you have a winning combination!  The long queue says it all - good food is always worth the wait. If you haven't tried it yet, you're definitely missing out! 

But one tip - don't touch the hot beverage from this coffee shop. It's never been good since day one. "
Great roti prata..
"It's at a corner coffee shop but that
Prata is really crispy and good!  Worth a pit stop"
The prata was great.
Super crispy prata 
"amazing food ,the price was really low. so kind and nice staff"
"Very good prata, recommended if you can eat it in the spot. Takeaway might cause the prata to lose its ""crispyness"". Fish gravy was good and complimented the prata well

Longer than usual wait during peak periods (I waited nearly an hour for my prata)"
Best prata and the only roti prata with sambal ikan bilis. Best!
Very old school style coffee shop and Prata is fluffy n good..
"Amazing crispy prata! Their plaster prata is fantastic. Queues are not too bad these days, 5-20min"
best prata in sg fr
Best! Best! Best crispy prata in Singapore.
"Today is my lucky day, come here and coffee shop was not busy, got my crispy egg prata within 8 min.

Generous portion of the curry, thick but fluffy prata, what not to like?"
Crispy and delicious! Best prata I've had. 
"One of the finest roti prata in town.

Made a pilgrimage from the west for the second time because it was sold out the first time we visited. 100% worth it.

Ordered the classic egg and kosong prata and shared the coin prata. The prata has a natural aroma of fresh dough that doesn't feel oily a tiny bit. It's well crisp the old school natural way which I love. Each mouth was a delight.

The service was top notch. The lady taking our orders was patient and friendly. She even introduced their special in house ikan bilis sambal that was flavorful and not overly spicy.

We reached at 12pm on a Friday noon and only had to wait for 4 quick orders before us. After ordering at the counter, which you can pay via cash or paynow, you collect a buzzer and wait to be buzzed.

Calories are precious my friends, and it's a great joy to spend them here."
"The crispyness of the plain prata here is 7/10. It is consistently crispy through the prata, and also has a beautifully fluffy texture in the mouth.

We took both the chicken and the fish curry; chicken curry was just ok, but the fish curry - WOW! Very flavourful, smooth, and i found it difficult not to keep going spoonful after spoonful. Out of the 8 places we visited, i rate this fish curry the highest at 8/10.

Having arrived just before lunch, the venue was not too hot. Not sure what it would be like when the crowd comes in or when the weather is in full afternoon heat.

A memorable experience! Crispy and light prata with incredibly flavour-packed fish curry. One of the places i'd love to go back to & try more."
"Mr & Mrs Mohgan Super Crispy Roti Prata lives up to its reputation as one of the best prata spots in Singapore. Each prata is prepared with remarkable technique, resulting in a perfectly crispy, layered exterior.

The Plain Prata was a mind-blowing, with its delicate layers that shattered like a croissant with every touch. The Egg Prata was equally impressive, crispy on the outside and dense on the inside, offering a satisfying contrast in texture. The choice of curry is equally important, and while both Fish and Lamb Curry are available, the Fish Curry stands out as the ideal accompaniment, complementing the prata beautifully.

While the wait time can stretch up to an hour, it's a small price to pay for the exceptional quality and flavour on offer. The consistency and attention to detail make every bite worth the wait."
"Always serving the best crispy Prata.
Always freshly made and delicious curry to go with it.
And mother and daughter always smiling when serving customers no matter how busy they are in the mornings. Love it!"
This place never opens or what ? Heard it's the best place ? Best place that never opens and just occupying the space. Def don't respect the professionalism here they never update or follow their google map times. Doubt  I will back be back as there are so many Prata places anyway.
Currently my favorite prata place in Singapore. Pratas are both crispy and fluffy at the same time. I always order at least one plain/kosong and one egg and they are both always consistently good. Side curry is tasty as well. They sometimes sell out especially during holiday periods so best get there as early as possible to avoid missing out! Cash only.
"This Roti Prata in Singapore is seriously one of the best I've ever had!

The Roti Prata is super crispy, and the savory samble chili and fish curry takes it to the next level. It's like a flavor explosion in your mouth! 

Just a little warning if you guys wanna come on a weekend you'll got to be very early because the Pratas sells out fast and parking can be very challenging due to limited curbside parking lots!"
"My most favourite roti prata place in Singapore.
It used to cost $1 for a piece of crispy prata but it is now $1.50. Worth it? YES!

They are very systematic with the queue system in placed --> the daughter will take your order, you pay and she will inform you of your number. You pick a seat and just wait for your number to ping. Simple as that!"
Just that this coffee shop charges $1.50 for a kopi O kosong! Ridiculous!!!
"Tried the coin, plain, egg and cheese and mushroom prata. Not a fan of the coin prata, because is sweet. Is a personal preference. The crispy prata is crispy and airy, is not bad. The egg prata is not soggy and there's a good fluffiness in it. Cheese and mushroom prata taste like ""Indian pizza"". They served good prata but it's not worth the 1hr wait during weekends. And the curry is..... Go on weekdays, probably the wait time is shorter and service level will be much better."
One of the best if not the best prata!
Outlandishly delicious
"My favorite roti prata in Singapore. Tasty dough, crispy prata and a sardine murtabak that's crisp on the outside - but the sardines are done just right on the inside. The first time i ordered it, the boss' daughter even came over to ask me how it was because she made it herself. She doesn't make it everyday but it's consistently good and I like that they displayed such pride in their food."
"came on Sunday the wait was more than half an hour. the Prata Kosong was very crispy outside and soft inside, but the Egg Prata was not crispy probably due to the added egg. Sold out by 11am before our food was ready. The curry gravy was thick and nice. Given a queue number but no beeper so you have to watch the display to keep track of your turn!"
"I've always wanted to try Mr & Mrs Mohgan Super Crispy Roti Prata, but the long queues kept me away. Today, on Boxing Day, I decided to arrive early at 8 AM and was pleasantly surprised by a light queue. Finally, I got to taste their famous prata--and it was absolutely worth the wait. The plain prata was delightfully flaky and light, pairing perfectly with a sprinkle of sugar for a simple yet satisfying treat. The egg prata, on the other hand, was crisp on the edges and fluffy inside, pairing beautifully with the rich, flavorful curry, which came with potato and vegetables. Every bite was a joy. Truly a must-visit for any prata lover--early mornings are the secret to beating the queue!"
Service here is horrible and the waiting time is ridiculous. My prata came out very soggy not crispy at all. I will definitely not be coming here again not I will tell my friends to come. Not worth it.
I like it - it's prepared fresh and has the right balance of crispiness and buttery taste. If only the curry was spicier ... come early on week day (8/9am) to avoid long queues.
"love the crispy outside and doughy inside, i only get the plain prata (long queues on the weekend, try going on a random weekday morning instead)"
"It's a simple operation and the location is the best part even if parking options are not the best. I only ordered the egg prata as that's usually a good reflection of the baseline quality. It was made fresh, slightly crispy and went well with the fish curry."
"Prata is good, but the prata store does not provide food trays. For those customer who ordered a lot, they will have to collect their food running multiple trip. Wonder if the shop has not earned enough to provide trays for it customers. "
"This is hands down the best roti prata spot in Singapore, and I say this after trying countless others. A few suggestions:

1. Expect a line on weekends. Arriving at 9:30 am means you'll likely have to wait. While the dough used to run out early (about a decade ago), you're generally safe arriving around 11 am. However, wait times can stretch up to an hour if a few people place large orders, so plan accordingly.

2. The prata is awesome, especially the plain (kosong), coin, and egg prata. However, the curry is meh (I don't know what some of the other reviewers are going on about -- the curry is thin and lacks any real ingredients). You should plan on ordering 2-3 pratas per person at about $1.5-$2 per prata.

3. Skip the teh/kopi--they're terrible. Opt for a canned drink or skip the drink altogether. Avoid using a straw. The coffee shop owner doesn't dispose of used straws properly, so... draw your own conclusions.

4. There are several good stalls nearby. Consider grabbing a few dishes from them to pass the time while waiting for your prata. The sliced fish noodles are excellent. The carrot cake is excellent.

5. Please avoid letting the bottom of the plates touch your food. It's common to see people stacking the curry bowl on top of the prata--that's just nuts. Since they don't use trays, make multiple trips if needed but please don't let the bottom of the plate/bowl touch your food. Trust me that the hygiene and cleanliness levels are not that great.

I have been going here for 12+ years. I remember Mr. Mohgan and Mrs. Mohgan. I remember the time hot oil landed on Mrs. Mohgan's hand and she and her husband had a fight. I remember him as a finicky perfectionist for the prata and pretty much nothing else. Now, the daughter has taken over and she has made it her place. I think her parents would be proud."
"This place was raved on reviews and I was not sure what I was expecting and it was quite a trek to get there as it's nowhere close to the city centre. We got there as early as possible around 9am reading the review on how busy it can get. We arrived at the perfect timing and there was virtually no wait and we were able to get a table straightaway. Whilst I do not have a lot of experience of roti, this was super hearty, warm, crispy, buttery yet light roti that I enjoyed a lot. The accompanying curry was also delicious and perfect balance to the rotis buttery flavours. I recommend the basic roti and the coin Prata."
"It's still good after all these years, but it's not as great as when I first had it.

Crispy, and not oily. Definitely remains one of the better pratas around."
"As their name goes, the prata here is crispy, light and very delicious! Be warned though that there is almost always a long queue and on weekend mornings, the wait can easily be 45 mins to an hour."
"VERY GOOD, HAND KNEADED PRATA 

updated: still every so good! prices went up, but quality was maintained. "
Best prata ever...
"Very good prata. Just like the name, super crispy!"
"Piping hot curry with choice of fish or mutton. Truth to be told, neither had a distinct flavor.

Kosong was crispy while the egg & onion was fresh and flavorsome.

It is definitely a very good prata but not being the best. 4.5*"
"First time here. Arrived at 7:15 on a Sunday. Queue to take order and pay first. Get a number and sit down. When your number is called, collect yourself. Waited 15mins. Roti Prata was really good and crispy. Eat while hot. Curry was thick and spicy but not sour enough. I personally prefer those type of super sour fish curry. But their curry was still good enough. Highly recommended!"
"This was utterly delicious.  It was quick to order but took 30 + minutes for our food to be ready.  We got a table quickly, enjoyed a drink while
we waited.  Loved it!"
My husband would buy this on his way home from the airport and my kosongs are still crispy! Tasted really good every time he got some forme. I'd want to eat it there soon.
Large crowd and long queues for breakfast from early to mid morning. This is one of the better prata eateries in Singapore.
Totally worth the 30 minutes wait to get the parantha.
Fantastic mutton murtabak! Highly recommend them.
Delicious. My favourite Cheese Egg Prata with Fish Curry.
"Mi ca cua minh an rat ngon. Tiem nho nam phia trong quan com phia truoc. Nuoc mi rat dam da. Ca phe o day chi co $1.25 thoi.
Lan sau se quay lai."
"It is as good as it gets. Came as a party of 3 and got plaster prata, egg & onion prata, cheese prata, coin prata & the mutton murtabak.

Crispy, savoury pasta. The most outstanding prata in my opinion is the mutton murtabak 
Incredibly crispy on the outside but soft, moist and packed with onions, potatoes & chunks of mutton inside the prata.

I've never tasted a better Murtabak 
So thankful I've had such a solid breakfast at Joo Chiat today."
WORST COFFEESHOP EVER. TEA WAS HORRIBLE. TASTES LIKE THEY HAVE PLACED IT OVERNIGHT. Ordered Kosong and they asked for additional 10cents because they had to brew the tea from scratch? Nonsense. Never returning. Hope Mr and Mrs Morgan moves to somewhere else as the owners are getting cocky.
In coffeeshop beside dunman food centre. Crispy prata and not bad fish curry. Worth a try
30-min wait (just order and walk around haha) but prata is so lightly crisp and the curry is so balanced! Highly rec!
"There is always a long queue and they sold out by about 1pm so be there early!

The aunty is super nice and friendly, she once offered to treat me because I forgot to bring cash!

Been visiting them for over 10 year and still find their prata and curry consistently one of the best I have had.

Be prepared to wait for up to an hour during busy hours."
"Ordered a Plain Prata (SGD1.50) and Egg Prata (SGD2) to share.

I would say this is definitely one of the best prata places in SG for sure. The pratas had a buttery fragrance but they were not oily at all? The Plain one had a nice crisp and it's good on its own even w/o any condiments.

The egg was evenly spread in the Egg Prata so you get a nice flavour of it in every bite 

Their fish curry was thick but surprisingly not spicy at all (wish it had some kick). The sambal was on the sweeter side. But honestly, the pratas need no condiments."
"In my view, amongst the premiere locations for prata dishes - great taste and nice portions at good prices. Very popular at peak times - another testonomy to their cult."
"The roti here is the best on this island, fresh and crispy.  Curry is great also. Too bad the coffee (different stall) is terrible and expensive when compared to the average prices in coffee shops."
"They weren't capping when they said that their pratas are crispy. It's actually quite good and worth the price. Solid place, wait might be long."
"We heard too much of this prata store so our friends took us there. The taste of the curry was good. We ordered three type of prata: kosong(plain); egg; and egg with onion. The texture of prata is crispy but something was missing compared to traditional prata. Therefore, nothing to sing about."
"It's been along time since I had a plaster prata in SG with a runny yolk.
Finally (T__T)
Ordered plaster and egg onion prata, flavor of the prata is on point. Good taste of dough, a pinch salty, with a good body of ghee. Simple, but with depth.
Finished every last drop of curry."
"I think it's a really good version of crispy style prata in Singapore, possibly the best rendition of the crispy-style that I have tried so far. Overall I think I'll give it a 7/10.

Admittedly I haven't tried much cos this type is not really my taste. I'm more of a kampung style roti canai kind of fan.

Anyway, that being said, I found the ingredients at Mr and Mrs Moghans to be high quality. The sardines in the murtabak and the ikan bilis in the sambal had a good mackerel flavor. Neither fishy nor lackluster. The sardines murtabak isn't the type with tomatoes, which I liked while my dining company didn't. I was addicted to the sambal and ate it on its own. Their blend of chillies, fish, salt and acid was just right for me (but hey everyone has their preference).

I found the prata a little too oily, but I guess that's to be expected. Even then, I think the oiliness is within generally acceptable levels. There was a strong margarine taste which was a little off-putting for me."
Legendary prata place at Joo Chiat for sure to satisfy any prata craving. The prata here is really done well. Crispy and fluffy with solid fish curry.
"One of the best and crispiest prata, truly worth the wait."
"If you're close to Joo Chiet Road, you have to visit Mr. & Mrs. Mohgan.  The best roti, parts, and muturbak one can experience.  A must!!!"
"Prata used to be much nicer. These days, it seems like they are only deep frying or frying them with oil. The Prata is both crispy on the outside and inside. More like biscuit  used to be one of my family's fav go-to for a Prata craving fix.

Only the egg Prata was ok as it made the inside soft...  might be a one off I hope... will come back again to try it some day"
"My favorite meal in Singapore. Roti is flaky & buttery, fish & mutton curries are each very flavorful & pair perfectly with the roti. And it's exceptionally affordable. Will always try to visit at least once when in town."
"Been coming here for breakfast about once a month recently, service is fast considering each order is cooked upon order. Prata is always served hot and crispy and any request on curry (fish, or top up) is warmly accepted. Price is very reasonable. I like the coin prata but minimum is 5pcs which could be much for 1 pax, and it's on the sweet side so some people may not like it."
"Found this gem couple months ago, used to think springleaf prata is the best in the east region till I stumbled upon this. I conclude this is the best imo.

Prata is crispy & flaky & portion just nice for me not too big or small. Only downside is the ventilation in this coffeeshop is terrible.
After eating, whole person smell oily and greasy."
"Very crispy pasta. The queue was long. Worth waiting!

There's a guy who is very nice. Helps us to find . Thanks to him! "
As always my number 1 place for roti prata. Simply delicious. Prata is hot and crispy. Curry is super fragrant. Service is quick. Stall owner is friendly.
Very enjoy to having the Crispy Prata over here .
"Was at first wary of getting into trouble with ordering and expecting terrible service. However, order was taken without any issues and served rather promptly. Prata is thin, crispy and tasty."
We first encountered Mr and Mrs Mohgan about 8 years on a visit to Singapore and now in 2024 we headed back to Singapore and had the crispy roti prata on our list. Our visit did not disappoint. Was saddened to hear that Mr Mohgan had passed yet the crispy pratas which are his legacy was still spot on. Accompanied by a fish curry it really hit the spot. We also had the roti telur and it too was crispy with the egg layered in with the prata. As good as I remembered!
crispy with chewy insides. onion filled adds another layer of texture and sweetness. best in singapore johor and batam.
One of the best prata I have tried. Highly recommended.
Mutton curry with Roti was incredible
Nice prata and probably one of the better in the east
"When my wife and I arrived for breakfast at about 9.45am, we placed our order as queue no. 107 while queue no. 102 was being served.

It took about 10 mins before our order was served. The pratas are freshly made by order, and not dished out from a stack of already made pratas.

The plain prata is cracking-crispy on the outside but the inside is deliciously chewy. This is unlike some pratas sold elsewhere where the crispiness turns the prata into a cracker like quality.

The egg prata is not as crispy and complements the plain prata well.

This was our first time enjoying the pratas and will be back for more! It is one of a few stalls in an open-ventilated corner coffee shop."
"After 5 failed attempts, we finally tried their crispy pratas and they are crispy, fresh and yummy. The mutton murtabak is maybe the best I had in SG.
Cons: about 30' waiting time, coin pratas were sweet (maybe their signature but not a fan)."
"Tasty and crispy egg prata, served with fish/mutton curry and sambal (with ikan bilis)"
Five different prays all wonderful. Closed on Wednesdays though!
"Decided on roti prata for lunch and so it was a weekend, we ventured out further to Joo Chiat.  Wanted to try Mr Mrs Mohgan for a long time but too far to go for just breakfast.
Crowd was not as many as I expected and there was a simple que number system so it was order and wait; not bad.
We ordered the mutton murtabak  and roti kosong.  I must say that I was really impressed with the murtabak as I have never had mutton curry added into a mutton murtabak.  Often, it's just fried dried mutton buts but this was mutton curry and it was really good!
The roti kosong was as good as the reviews! Thin and crispy but it would have been better if they were not fried in oil but I'm not complaining! 
The real star of the show however was the unassuming curry.  We were given both mutton and fish curry.  They were generous and gladly provided extra curry when we asked for it and we made sure to slurp it all up with our remaining roti.
Overall a great meal and experience.  Will be going to Joo Chiat more often.."
"I know it is supposed to be a street food, this $9 murtabak is good to eat while it is hot, but we had a funny feeling in the stomach after 15 mins, we believe it is overly oily or the oil used to pan fried it was heavily reused."
must come early so as not to be disappointed. can be quite crowded. difficult parking if during peak. Prata taste is well balanced. Curry is good. Update Jan 24. Price increased plain is 1.30 to 1.50$. Mutton curry is awesome.
"The plain roti is sensational and unbelievably crispy with thin flaky layers. So great we ordered an extra egg and onion prata and mushroom prata. Both were good, but the plain was our favorite by far. Curry served alongside was nice."
"The most memorable piece of plain prata I've ever eaten in my life. Unthinkably crispy and flaky, almost like a croissant. Super super good and flavourful. Must-try."
Super crispy and light prata and one of the best curries I've ever had
A wait is worth it if you want the best Prata  around.
Still my personal favourite - egg prata is fluffy and crispy! Always feel like it's made with so much love hahaha anw! The waiting time is faster now even tho the queue is still long!
Probably the best in Singapore. Owners let me create my own hack. Delicious!
"Went to Mr & Mrs Super Crispy Prata for a late breakfast on a weekend, introduced by my partner who knew my love for prata, and it definitely did not disappoint.

Tucked in a small coffee shop on Joo Chiat Street, it is extremely popular among the locals. As the name suggests, their prata is consistently crispy yet not too oily, with great-tasting dough.

My personal go-to dishes, which I highly recommend, are the plaster prata and the egg cheese prata. The plaster prata features a perfectly cooked egg with a runny yolk, which pairs extremely well with their signature sambal sauce. Their sambal is on the sweeter side but is packed with flavor. Combined with the curry, it creates a match made in heaven for their prata. The egg cheese prata is thick and hearty, with a generous amount of cheese packed within the egg and dough.

The coffee shop is relatively small with limited seating, and on weekends, the prata may run out quickly. So, do come early and be prepared to wait for both seats and food. Nonetheless, it is worth the trip to indulge in their sinful yet delectable prata."
"Pratas here do not disappoint - freshly made, piping hot and crispy without being oily at all! Tried the basic plain prata and plaster prata - both are delectably yummy in their own way. The fish curry is thicker than most, which complements the prata really worth.  The service is warm and friendly by an elderly Indian lady, who will call your number when your order is ready for collection. The old school coffee shop vibes and ambience make this meal experience both authentic and nostalgic. Will be back for more, well worth the money, trip and wait."
"Breakfast 11/6.

Good and crispy coin prata.

Crispier than usual coin prata. Daughter loves it.

The curry was decent too. Especially liked the potato chunk given, firm yet soft."
"Great Prata, worth visiting, limited morning hours"
"The place is located quite far away from the mrt. I went on a Friday morning around 8+, and was quite surprised to see quite a number of tourist with tourist tags around the area. Despite the small crowd, there were still places to sit.

I ordered the plain and mushroom prata. One just has to queue up and tell the aunty your order. The aunty will let you know your number, and when your turn comes, you go collect your prata from the stall.

I was given the egg prata and mushroom prata. The prata was indeed the crispy type and did not need pulling and tugging to break it into smaller pieces. Besides the crispyness, the texture was actually almost fully different from your normal roti prata. I would consider this prata a different variant of roti prata altogether.

Taste wise, I do like this variant of roti prata. For the mushroom prata, there were plenty of mushrooms and they were quite generous with it.

For the fish curry that comes as a condiment, their fish curry is relatively strong tasting and I liked that about the fish curry. Most stalls would have given watered down versions which are not that nice. Also, the curry's spiciness was just the right amount.

Overall, thir gets 5 stars from me, for the unique and great taste. It was a good roti prata, and there was something special.

Only downside was that even on a weekday queue, I had to wait around 20 mins for a queue order which was lagging behind by 10 orders only. Cant imagine how it will be on a weekend."
Fav prata shop. Always plain prata and coin for me. Crispy and  not oily. Love the curry too.  Always come early on weekday. Weekends the wait is crazy.
Whether the prata is good or not really doesn't matter with such poor and rude service!
Their cheese prata is indeed super crispy and delicious. :)
"Yes, it is good but not the only good ones.

If you wish to be treated reasonably and politely, go somewhere else."
Prata is crispy with the right amount of chew on the inside. Ikan bilis sambal is splendid and pairs very well with the prata. Well worth the travel from the west.
"Found this as a recommendation on timeout, was not disappointed as a must visit spot in Singapore. Located in a food market, the pratas were crispy, delicious and very morish."
"Prata is really as good as it is known for. Had a plain Prata and an egg Prata. Can't remember is it my first time here. Enjoyed my Prata. Was there like 7am+ and my queue number is 32 of the day. 

Normally I eat my Prata as it is without curry/sugar. Somehow decided to try the curry a bit and it's flavourful. Good. "
"Very tasty Prata.. Wait is not long, but be sure to go early as they can run out of some items.. This time we wanted the mutton, bit they ran out at 10am already...."
"Finally got a chance to try this place. Came in around 1pm on a weekday. Ordered mutton murtabak (I think we got one of the last available orders of it). It was excellent. Super crisp with generous, flavorful filling. Will be back."
"Only one prata per person is enough, be prepared for a fat/sugar income :p
Super crispy outside, soft inside. Definitely worth a try!"
Mrs Morgan and staff Thank you
Best roti prata i've ever had.
"Recommendation from my neighbor, tried the  Egg Onion Prata $2.60, it's really crispy and tasty. And the fish curry is rich and flavorful. Mrs Mohgan was very generous when I asked for extra curry! Will return for more great crispy prata and curry!"
"Men Dian Liao Yuan Wei,Qi Si He Ji Dan Jian Bing
Ka Li Hen Bang,Shi Liang De Xiang Liao He Yi Xie Nong Yu De Wei Dao Dan Shuo Shi Hua,Wo Ren Wei You Ni. Kou Gan Cui Pian Shi Zhong Bao Chi Yi Zhi,"
So crispy - so good.
"Roti Prata (plain prata) is really nice and crispy. Get ready for a long wait on a weekend.

Plain Prata: $1.50
Egg Prata: $2.00"
"Like what others said, prata is crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. However, the prata itself is salty, not sure why."
"I have read many good reviews about the super crispy prata and decided to try it.  Honesty,  I was sceptical at first because some overly crispy prata I tasted in the past made me feel like eating biscuits.  Mr & Mrs Mohgan's crispy prata is different.  The outer crust is super crispy, and the inside is soft and fluffy.  I guess that explains why it took some 20 mins before our prata was served.  It's worth the wait.   The prata is a little too salty to me, but I still enjoyed it."
"Delicious crispy prata overall. Texture and taste was great, especially the coin prata."
Prata was good but the coffee here is terrible
"Unassuming looking, but amazing food"
Prata crispy and nice Curry!
"Whenever there is an opportunity to come by here, we would order the plain prata (personal favourite) and the coin prata. The crisp is delicious at every bite!

The coin prata is sugar coated just right with a good crunch, curry is also flavourful.

Gotta come here for all who haven't tasted a good prata for a while!"
"Extremely long waiting time about 2h on weekends. Prata might be crispy but it taste like any ordinary prata, nothing special."
"As it says on the tin. Crispy prata, if that's your thing."
"I would like to say that Mrs Mohgans Prata is new and improved! There was a period during the previous months that I felt that the Prata was smaller and drier but at the current level, I feel like its better than ever! Do ask for the mutton curry as it's pairs very well especially with the egg options !"
It is a prata stall in a small coffeeshop. Prata is good but it can also be found at many other prata stalls in Singapore. Self-service. The stallholder is not friendly.
One of the best prata you can find locally n reasonably priced
Great Coin Prata. As good as the coin parottas I've had in Chennai. Good mutton curry gravy too.
"Hands on best prata in Singapore.
My number was called but Boss Lady told me as mine is a bit burnt she will redo mine

Wow. Never thought will feel loved over a prata. My egg prata was $2. Ordered 7:45am and ate at 8:20am on a Sat. Continuous flow of people ordering the food.

Side note the teh and kopi is really horrible.
My teh is soooo siapppp (translate; the sharp tanning taste of a tea no one enjoys)"
"We had two rotis: onion and egg, and banana. A dish of sauce was provided with each roti. We dug in with our fingers, dipping the roti pieces into the sauce. The sauce complemented the onion egg roti but the banana version was better without sauce. The rotis were hot, crisp, and flaky with a nice buttery flavor. The best we have ever had.
As we were living out with our finger-licking good rotis, we noticed that the locals use a fork and spoon for their roti meals. We brought our own napkins so no harm no foul."
"If you come on a weekend it will be a long Q number orders. We waited almost an hour or so as it was our first visit.
Prata and curry was good but for a long wait, I am not too sure.

Coffee shop coffee not recommended if you decided to wait for Prata n drink. Nearby hawker has much better coffee option."
"First time visiting this famous place. Ordered plain, cheese and coin prata. There's no queue on Monday around 8:30. It took less than 20 mins to get our orders. Really liked plain and coin prata. Cheese one was a bit salty for me but the combination with curry and prata was really good. Coin prata was sweetish. All pratas were crispy and softy. Will definitely come back soon!"
"Food is great but waiting time is insane, first time here but i hoped i could have gotten some warning that the wait will be 1hr+ on a saturday morning and make a more informed decision not to go ahead.  End up we had to give up our seats and opt for takeaway, in fact, come back later to collect :/ as we had to clock in at work"
"Really my favorite food in Singapore.
Mutton curry is really delicious. I like prata so much!"
"It has been a while since I had really great prata in Singapore! Woke up at 5+ on a Sunday morning & wondering any breakfast place to hit up, ended up w Mr & Mrs Mohgan super crispy roti prata.

I like how their prata are made upon order versus many stores which had prepared in batches & I ended up soggy and chewy ones which I regret ordering at the first place.

We ordered plain, cheese and also egg pratas while saw a few other morning birds who went for coin prata instead. The crispness was so addictive and I was already thinking if I wanted to order extra when I am on my first one. I must say one of the best I had in Singapore for sure.

Curry was great, the right amount of spice & some tanginess to complement and cut down the greasiness of prata but in all honesty, I thought the prata was not greasy at all. The crisp was consistent throughout even when it cooled down & is just the right amount of thickness too.

I am totally gonna come back for more, and definitely bring some of my friends to here too.

The only thing I wish to go with it was great coffee shop coffee which did not go well, we had water downed version from the drinks store"
"GOATED, or for the boomers one of the best pratas in Singapore"
Can not be wrong: food is great
"Crispy and fluffy. Accompanying curry is great too.
The tea at the coffee shop is not good at all."
The best roti PRATA in all of Singapore!!!!
"Plain prata was super crispy and egg prata was very fresh.. Highly recommend the coin prata, it's worth a try 

No queue at 730 in the morning, good to be there before 9"
Prices have gone up again. $1.50 for plain and $2 for egg. Still tasty but less value for money now
"Breezy coffee shop with a simple signboard for Mr & Mrs Mohgan's prata, one of the best in Singapore! Freshly pan fried and indeed it's extremely crispy! Love their thick curry (sometimes with a piece of potato). Their ordering process is also very systematic. Tell them your order pay in cash and get a number told to you. There's always plenty of seats and an invasive drinks stall uncle who kept coming to you asking you to order drinks. Prices of pratas are honestly still very wallet friendly considering inflation etc. a very local breakfast staple :)"
prata is great. worth the wait.
"Very nice crispy prata and the curry is excellent.

However be prepared to wait around 40mins during weekend between 7 to 9am."
waited 1h for food on a rainy saturday morning. prata was above average and crispy but for 1h i won't come again. do recommend the plaster prata.
"Despite being an Eastie for 37 years. It's my first time trying #mrandmrsmohgan #rotiprata
Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. I like how they do my plaster well too. No broken egg yolk and runny yolk. I also like how their curry comes really hot too, although it feels slightly diluted.
Heard their daughter is taking over the business after their father passed away recently. Hope she can keep the high standards. #singaporefood #rotipratakosong #rotiplaster"
"The wait can be quite long on weekend mornings - we had to wait about 45 minutes for our order. Seating space in the coffee shop is quite limited as well.

The prata was not bad and the curry amount provided was decent, however I don't think it lives up to the hype."
Still one of the best pratas to have for bf or brunch. Crispy on the outside but soft on the inside.
"Braved the rain and came earlier in the morning to avoid the long queues at about 8am but still needed to wait for about 30 minutes for the food to be ready.

Was sorely disappointed with the much-raved-about pratas - overrated and overpriced

Though the pratas were crispy, that was about it. Zero wow factor and taste was mediocre at best with the curry also being quite tasteless.

You could get the same quality at almost any other prata shops - just not as crispy."
Crispy prata without losing the chewy texture inside. Solid find!
Your old school kind of vibe where we get to eat authentic prata with authentic vibes let's enjoy our food Sundays closed too bad
"My first time trying this and I would say it is really good pratas. It will be one of my breakfast runs if I wake up that early and is around the East area.

Drinks from the drink stall was ok"
"I visited the stall on a rainy and cold Sunday morning, hoping for a less crowded experience at this famous prata stall. Surprisingly, I still had to wait 35 minutes for the food. While the prata was crispy, and the curry was smooth and delicious, it didn't quite deliver the ""wow"" factor that would justify the lengthy wait. However, others in my dining party thoroughly enjoyed the prata."
"Chill prata place. Expect queues of up to 20,30min. Prefer the kosong to egg prata. Regulars keep coming to this corner, limited seating place.Parking headache."
"After trying this prata stall, I understood it's popularity. It's GOOD.

It's located inside Tin Yeang kopitiam, which is beside Dunman Food Centre, with plenty of road side parking nearby.

I went around 910am, ordered one plain and one egg prata, and paid $3.60 as at January 2024. I was first in queue and it took about 2 minutes before my order could be taken due to  there being only one lady taking and placing out orders. The queue number at my time of order was 81 and I was given queue number 88. I sat and waited for approximately 7 minutes before my number was called and I collected my order from the stall. The prata was crispy goodness, reflected in the namesake of the stall. The prata was not dense and crispy. It was light, fluffy and crispy. Yum. Came with a small bowl of curry that complemented the prata.

The kopitiam had sufficient cooling and overall was a pleasant experience."
The best crispy prata in the east. But don't expect service with a smile and make sure you have cash.
"Think the photo speaks for itself. Look at the cripiness. I like also that though crispy, it's not hard and dense but still retains it's flufiness. Really good prata. Fish curry was good also.

Expect however to wait given how popular this place is."
It's super crispy Pratha. Only downside is the 45 min to 1 hour wait
"My all-time favourite prata! Love the plain and plaster prata! It's crispy on the outside and fluffy inside, and it's not doughy at all. Curry here is thick and delicious too.

Highly recommend and definitely worth the wait!"
Best prata in sg nuff said. It's basically an indian croissant - flaky and crispy on the outside while being light and buttery (???) on the inside. Coin prata has a small coat of sugar on the outside almost like its kouign aman lol. But personally i think the plain prata is king. Wait time is about 15 to 30mins but worth the wait imo.
"Amazing prata, super crispy and yummy"
"Mr & Mrs Mohgan's Super Crispy Roti Prata: A Symphony of Crunch and Chew

Forget flakey croissants, fluffy pancakes, and wafer-thin chips. The real superstars of crispy textures reside at Mr & Mrs Mohgan's Super Crispy Roti Prata stall. Having devoured their legendary coin, plain, and plaster pratas, I'm here to declare them champions of the crispy carb.

Coin Prata: Bite-sized perfection, these golden nuggets crackle under the gentlest touch. Each layer whispers secrets of butter and sugar, creating a caramelized sweetness. Their addictive nature is undeniable and no surprise it is one their signatures and must-order.

Plain Prata: The OG, stripped bare but oh-so-beautiful. Crispy and delicious. Best paired with the provided fish and mutton curry.

Plaster Prata: Imagine your typical egg prata but elevated to another level. The egg exposes itself on top of the crispy prata along with it's gooey yolk. Recommended to spread the yolk and enjoy it with the prata.

Accompaniments: The fish and mutton curry is provided when you collect your food. Very flavourful and a must to dip it with your prata. Personal favourite will be the fish curry with it's slight tinge of sourness.

The Verdict: Mr & Mrs Mohgan's Super Crispy Roti Prata lives up to the overwhelming positive reviews. All their different pratas are a testament to meticulous technique and time-honored tradition. Be prepared for queues as all are are made to order, but don't be daunted. These crispy wonders are worth every minute of the wait.

Final rating: 5 out of 5 stars, with an extra crispy star for the coin pratas!

Pro tip: Share the pratas amongst friends, especially the coin prata due to it's sweet dessert nature - variety is the spice of life, and crispy life is best enjoyed in good company."
"When I accidentally wake up earlier than usual, this stall is definitely one of my go-to breakfast places. Their prathas are soft and yummy and their mutton curry dip matches the prathas well. There's a long waiting time but it is quite worth it. I usually spend more than usual daily food budget when I eat here."
"BEST IN THEIR FIELD

This family run shop hands down the best of its kind cuisine I've had. I've been here several times and I've had a delicious meal on every occasion. They're really a cut above. Plasters and cheese prata are my all time favourite. Crispy, fluffy and so sinful. This is definitely my to-go place for prata."
Love the prata here.  Cozy place
"Prata itself is on the top 5 of my list, but the curry isn't good at all, just my opinion. Aunty is very friendly, and of course we are all aware of what happened in the family last year, but the wait here is TOO LONG for just prata!"
Prata is crispy. Curry is decent. Went on a weekday morning and the wait was acceptable at about 15-20mins.
Prata were crispy and delicious. Will definitely come back again.
"This is so far the best prata in Joo Chiat area, always crowed but worth for the waiting. A bit hard to find a parking lot though."
their coin prata is my favourite . even plain one is worth the try . pls support them . their is a legend in roti prata
Best prata
Very crispy prata! The best
Super crispy prata. Nice.
"Crispy prata. Tastes excellent and good value too. Beware that depending on what time you come, the wait can be very long. They take PayNow."

"The prata is quite good, Compared to other prata places out there. But the taste is not significantly different. IUnfortunately, it's not that food I'd be willing to wait for 50 mins for."
Quality crispy roti prata with equally tasty curry. Made multiple orders because it was so good.
"Understand why people say this is the best Prata in Singapore.

Initially I was quite underwhelmed by the small menu, cos I was too used to Springleaf's extensive innovations.

But everything we got were great - plain prata, plaster, egg cheese. Plain prata super crispy, the egg cheese ratio was perfect.

The coin Prata was tiny and different from what we were used to. But super unique, with the butter and sugar inside, it's like eating a cookie kind of.

Wish they would open a branch somewhere else!
Also was not crowded at all on a sat 12pm, I was surprised."
"Very popular place for prata, gets crowded during peak hours.

Prata was crispy, curry is tasty. Does not blow your mind, but does not dissapoint as well.

Good to satisfy your prata cravings."
"Food was good! Wait is rather long (30mins on a Friday morning around 9am), but food didn't disappoint. So good that I'm only left with curry to take a photo of.

Hawker is well ventilated so didn't feel too warm.

The process of ordering was smooth too. Most importantly, Paynow is possible "
Really the most crispy prata in sg. Just don't go on weekends unless u prepare to wait more than an hr
"Probably one of the best prata available in Singapore. If you prefer crispy prata, get the plain prata, otherwise consider the others with fillings of you want a slightly doughy texture. The fish curry here is tasty, full flavoured and goes very well with any prata."
"Finally here to try, indeed one of the best crispy prata. The egg prata is surprisingly fluffy on the inside yet crispy on the outside. Pairing with fish curry is just perfect. Old charm of Chinese kopitiam add to the overall local flavour. Expected to wait longer but it was ok."
"One of the best roti prata in Singapore.

On my last visit though, I would have preferred it just slightly less crispy and a little more doughy. Something like the coin prata but without the condensed  milk sweetness.

I like the plaster roti prata the most as the runny yolk tastes great with the crispy prata and curry and sambal (better than the normal egg prata which has the egg fully cooked and wrapped inside the plain prata).

Ordering was easy and straightforward - you get a queue number and come back to collect the food when it's your turn."
"A gem in the neighbourhood - beautifully crispy Rotis in classic and simplistic combinations of cheese, mushroom, garlic, banana & etc. Pairs wonderfully with their bright curry sauce.

Please note the restaurants early closing time and that flavours do run out quickly, especially over the weekend"
"In a corner coffeeshop with lots of open frontage and many fans to to stave off the heat. Prata is indeed crispy and light. About standard prata price but it is a smaller size prata. At $1.3 for a plain prata, really still affordable. Quite an organised process for dealing with the long queues and very flexible eg extra plates, splitting an order into takeaway and dine etc. Love sg hawkers!"
Prata is really good but the young lady was obnoxiously rude though I was being polite to her. Not worth the trip down from holland. It was a 30minutes + 30mins more when I asked her 15mins after the order. Total 45mins waste of time.
"Very crispy roti prata. Fish curry is great too. Would recommend.

Be aware of queue times. I was there at 12:30pm on a Friday and no queue to order but would be 10-15 minute wait for food. I managed to skip the queue because I just wanted 2 plain pratas which were already ready. 

Also not sure about the complaints about the coffee shop, I enjoyed the coffee. Classic kopitiam style."
"Mr & Mrs Mohgan is a long running establishment with a horde of loyal customers for many years. It is located in a kopitiam next to Dunman Food Centre.

Mr Mohgan passed away recently, but his wife and kids keep the place running and it is always busy. Sometimes the wait time can be as much as 45 minutes.

Pratas are crispy and soft at the same time. Goes so well with their fish curry, which we enjoyed thoroughly. Fish curry has a right balance of spice.

Recommend going in early to avoid disappointment of not being able to place an order OR having to stand in a long line."
"Best prata, but note that its difficult to find parking and the queue is long. Worth the wait!"
"The Roti Prata at Mr Mrs Mohegan in Joo Chiat Road is a delightful treat! The egg and plain Prata are crispy and irresistibly yummy, delivering a delightful crunch with every bite. The curry gravy complements the Prata perfectly, adding a burst of flavor that's just the right fit. The charming coffee shop atmosphere adds to the overall experience, making it a go-to spot for anyone craving these delicious, mouthwatering Pratas."
"When they are short of kitchen staff, I suspect they find temp replacements, making wait times really long for very forgettable prata and curry. Waited almost 30 minutes for prata we could have gotten at a random hawker center."
"I had coin prata (plain roti prata in a coin shape) paired with fish curry, and they were delicious. I visited on Tuesday at 11:30 am, and the waiting time was less than 15 minutes. However, on weekends, the wait can be up to an hour.

#2nd review (two months later)#
I hate to say this, but I wouldn't recommend coming here on weekends. Aside from the crowds, the prata is now made by a new male Indian chef and it's more like deep fried dough instead of proper prata. On weekends, they only serve a limited prata selection (even their famous coin prata isn't available). The chef is not only slow but really ruined my prata experience; it was oily and hard. It's a two-star experience. However, giving them the benefit of the doubt, I'll still maintain my initial rating of 4 stars from my first visit."
"Very good prata, even for takeout. Crispy outside, fluffy inside."
Too thick for me
"Pata is crispy indeed but gets jelak after first few bites cos it's so oily. Flavour of prata not as gd as neighbourhood ones, curry was bland. Coffee n tea at this coffeeshop cmi too. Not worth the wait."
"Simply awesome, waited for 30mins on a Sunday am."
"Their prata does have a slight crisp on the outside and I quite enjoyed it. The curry sauce that came with it was so-so. We came quite early in the morning hoping to beat the crowd. Yet, it took a while to get our food. Budget your time accordingly.

Side note: the kopi from the coffee shop was not great."
"A1 !!! For someone who has missed this wonderful food - it was spot on !! Egg/onion Prata (so crispy), mutton gravy. Grab a coffee as well, superb and great price !!"
Wait for one hour although not many people in the Q. The prata is crispy but the curry gravy is below my expectations.
"Dependable quality of roti prata. Sign indicated that due to manpower shortage, only plain and egg prata available, and mutton curry. Plain prata was done to a perfect crisp, egg prata was great. Mutton curry a good variation from usual curry gravy. Lots of patience needed as it is labour intensive, and there is a non-stop stream of customers. Hint: kopi and tea from the coffee shop is not fantastic."
"Nice prata, crispy on outside, soft and fluffy on the inside. Do expect to wait longer though, came on Sunday 10am and we were told 45 mins wait after paying, and we waited around 1 hr +. Need to hunt for seats as tables are limited."
"We had banana prata and coin prata. Very delicious. Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. Staff is super friendly. I will for sure come back for more :)"
"Food was super good! Prata was crispy, plain, egg and cheese was good. But would skip the banana prata as it made the prata less crispy.

Overall would definitely come back again if queue was shorter than 30mins. We waited for 50mins, may come back again during weekdays so the queue is shorter.

Staff was friendly while taking order."
"Not too oily, crispy and yummy. coin pratas for $5. Plain prata $1.30 egg prata $1.90.

Love the crispiness of the prata and esp the egg prata smells and taste really good. Crisp on outside. Fluff inside.

They now have 2 inside cooking and another 2-3 outside helping to serve. Waited for about 15 min for my prata on a Thursday.

I have checked with them.  Coz came on Tuesday and it was closed. Then Google maps said they are close on wed and Thurs. Do note that on alternate week 1 and 3 they will be closed on tue and wed as their is cleaning of the coffee shop. Even weeks they will be closed on wed unless specifically mentioned if they have matters to attend to."
Best prata in the east. The kopi served there is just bad though.
"More accurately 3.5 stars.. Prata was really crispy and enjoyable to deserve 4.5 stars. Had the plain, cheese, egg and banana. Think the egg was the best among the three. Came with fish and mutton curry. Both were exquisite.

But have to subtract 1 star for the whole experience of waiting. First visited on a Sunday 10am. Waited 45 mins only to be told that the batch spoiled. We were given a refund but not much else to compensate for the unproductive time. Was terribly spent,  hungry and disappointed for nothing.

The following week, came on a Saturday 930am. Waited more than an hour. So while the meal was really good, it was sadly not worth this kind of wait.

Come at a less busy time or just have prata elsewhere. Apart from the plenty order from diners, seems the queue gets held up more by bulk orders for takeaways. Wish there was a better way to fulfill these more effectively.

All the staff and owners were busy and hard at work in the kitchen but remained pleasant."
Great coffee shop and prata. Foods delicious esp with mutton curry
Love the super crispy prata here! And the curry gravy is thick and tasty!
"Went on a weekday noon and there was no queue, just a 5-10 minute wait for the food! Such crispy prata with a soft interior and AMAZING fish curry. We asked for Sambal just to try, it's on the sweet side and not spicy."
"We waited 1.5 hours  we ordered at 11.20am and got our food at 12.50. The wait was crazy and I'll never do it again but the prata was nice and cheaper than other famous prata places

Our ranking of the pratas we tried
1. Cheese prata ($2.50)
2. Egg prata ($1.90)
3. Plain prata ($1.30 - too crispy and not that nice)"
"More than an hour of wait, for the roti pratas on a Sunday morning is what you can expect from this insanely popular roti prata stall in Joo Chiat.

Was it worth the wait? I'm leaning towards yes as the plain and egg pratas we ordered were crispy and fragrant. And they went well with the tad sour curry. If only more roti prata places can replicate what they did here..

You can beat the line by patronising this place as early as 6 plus or simply order and shop/explore chic places along Joo Chiat road while letting that hour slip by.."
Wouldn't wait an hour for mediocre prata
Good prata but not worth queuing more than 20 minutes in my opinion.
"Apart from the crispiness, this prata is just disappointing. The dough simply do not have any flavour to contain itself. And the curry is just lazy. On top of the 30 to an hour wait."
"Friday 930am - waited only 10-15mins.
Lovely texture but too salty for my palate.
Eating with sugar actually balances it out better than the curry which adds to the saltiness."
"The crispiest prata in Singapore, hand made and served hot upon order. Stall owner is friendly and provide curry refills. Waited around 30mins but it was worth the wait. Signature coin prata was sold out but other types are also fulfilling. Fish curry has a good kick to it and has a distinct sourness that is not too overpowering. Will definitely be back, awesome breakfast!"
"The East Coast is dominating the field when it comes to finding affordable eats, and it's not even a close competition. Let's add prata to the list of elite offerings that the East Coast proudly boasts.

When it comes to prata, everyone will swear on where to find the best one. Personally, I believe prata is a unique dish in Singapore that transcends cultural and social boundaries. It's something that people from different backgrounds and households can all enjoy.

This place serves the crispiest prata I've had in Singapore this far. It arrives piping hot, accompanied by a choice of mutton or fish curry on the side. The prata boasts that desired crispy rich brown color on the top and isn't overly oily. Moreover, its inside is fluffy while the outside remains delightfully flaky, much like my friends. The restaurant is consistently busy, so the wait time can occasionally be a tad frustrating. Nevertheless, the end result is undeniably worth it. Remember to bring cash."
Cheap and tasty breakfast
Really very crispy. Its been a while since I last had such freshly made pratas 
Crispy and moist. Well worth the wait. Try the sambal. Certified SLAPS
"One of the best pratas I ever tasted (fish curry that comes with sambal), but long waiting time during peak periods"
"Had the chance to make my way here for breakfast - it's unfortunately cash only (not even paynow) so make sure you have some or use DBS/POSB at the giant next door. Prata is objectively tasty and crispy, although the mutton curry was slightly more bitter than I'd like. Service is very friendly."
Went on a Sat 9am and had to wait over 40 mins for the food. Had plain and egg prata; prata is good and curry was above average but I don't think the wait is worthwhile. Coffeeshop also doesn't serve decent teh c.
"One of the best pratha in town. Mutton curry and fish curry really awesome. Pratha crispy on the outside, soft on the inside! Auntie very helpful!"
100% my favourite prata place in SG- must get the sambal to go with it!! (just don't get the coffee shop coffee lol)
Best crispy and fluffy plain prata! Ask for sambal Chilli with your curry for that extra zng!
"Awesome crispy pratas, but so crowded! Be prepared to wait awhile to get seats. :)"
"Visited 27 July 2023 Sunny Summer Afternoon. The following sharing are based on our unbiased personal opinion and experience

Finally I'm here today to taste this legendary Mohgan Super Crispy Roti Prata. The only day I get to try so many good food within the morning at Joo Chiat Estate. Time check 1227hrs. This place is packed with lunch hour crowd and I'm fortunate enough to be able to find a table to dine in alone.

Placed my order for 2 x plain prata and waited patiently for my number to be called. Within 5mins of waiting crispy prata is served. Armed with right hand spoon left hand fork I start digging in and drench the prata with curry sauce.

Definitely not a disappointment at least for me. Comparing to other crispy prata this is on par. Not too oily and yet it's crispy. Curry sauce is thick and good as well.

4 
Location 4
Taste 4 
Price 4 

Give it a try the next time you visit Joo Chiat and share how you feel"
Crispy is right. Curry is well flavoured and deep. They sell out of stuff quick. Do expect a wait. Would come back.
"Very good Prata. The discs were surprisingly tasty and the right balance between flakyness, crisp and dough. Highly recommend. We die wait 1 hour as there were 30 orders before us.."
"Today is my third day having prata for breakfast (doing a dietary test on myself) and it's my first time having the prata at 'The Mohgan's'.

In recent years I believe this establishment has been one of the most talked about prata shops in the media, infamous for their quality and more so, long waiting times. Arriving at 0715, I was fortunate to get a parking lot within ten minutes and a table in a half filled coffee shop - everyone there gathered with a shared goal of coffee or prata. I ordered an egg prata add plaster ($2.50 and I'm wondering if auntie charged too cheap??!) and was told my number was 23. The box that flashes your number is wedged between the shopfront counter and the top menu signboard.

But auntie called me out when it was still number 20 and told me mine was ready which left me surprised, but pleased of course! I received a decent portion of a neither sweet nor savoury prata. It stands right in the middle on the flavour chart. My egg add plaster had a crispy underbelly that was quite outstanding. Runny yolk right in the centre, fluffy egg layered in the middle. Accompanied by a salty savoury fish curry with a piece of potato and RADISH! Radish. A very nice texture with the curry, not like the regular texture of starchy potato.

East siders are really lucky to have 'The Mohgan's' for prata, a beloved institution worthy of its recognition. Though I prefer a sweeter prata dough than I had this morning, I would still make the drive to dine here.

@goodfoodwrite - instagram & YouTube"
I can totally get the hype about these pratas. The crisp is heard in every bite. Had original and mushroom cheese prata - both yummy. The only downside is the waiting time. Took about 20+ mins on a weekday rainy morning for my order to be done. Pretty sure the wait time will be much longer during the weekends. But yes... Will be back but Id probably check on the order/waitlist first 
"The must have prata when in the east, consistently crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, The curry is a little bit spicier in the morning and better to arrive early unless you expect to wait ... 2-2.5 mins per queue number, we have waited up to an hour, but so worth it!!!"
"Hands down one of the best, if not the best, prata shops in Singapore. The pratas are fried just right, crispy and crackling. The clinchers are the thoroughly flavourful and thick curries - chicken and mutton - which go wonderfully with the pratas. Noe of the watered-down variety commonly found at other prata places."
Tasty. But long q
Very crispy pratas.
The prata I've tasted is absolutely the best - it boasts a consistently perfect crispiness that is on point.
"Really have to commend this place ! Even with no availability of their special coin prata that day, their egg and pastor blew us away."
The prata is crispy and light. The curry has a spicy kick to the taste buds and linger on. You need a cold drink
"Indian lady was Extremely rude. Likely business too good and don't require small business.

Won't ever patronize again even if free. This type of mentality takes customer for granted."
"Pretty sure most of the good reviews are fake. No matter how good the prata is, if the staff and owners can't be decent ppl and allowed others who came, ordered and paid later than us to get their food first, that's dishonesty! When asked politely, they were plain rude and defensive and said ""don't anyhow say"". Pls avoid and do not support such businesses, no matter how good the food is OR how else they got their seemingly good reviews here, they don't deserve our business."
"I've had this marked on my maps for over 5 years. Finally got here and was not disappointed. Recommend the Cheese, egg and onion prata"
"Went on a Sunday morning. Had to wait maybe 45 minutes, together with many other hungry families patiently waiting. The prata was fluffy and tasty. We had egg/ mushroom/ onion. The sambal and curry were balanced and flavourful too. With some drinks from the nearby drinks stall, we were all set for the weekend."
"No frills, but extremely delicious."
"i went there this morning with my son after hearing so much about this place for the 1st time. it was 7am when i reached and had to wait 25 min for my prata. The first bite with the mutton curry was so delicous, finish all 3 in no time.  the prata was crispy. My son agreed that it is the best prata we ate in singapore. i packed 10 more prata"
You can't miss to hang in here it's great place
About a 15mins wait on a Monday morning about 930am. Line up to order and she'll give you a queue number to remember and she'll call when ready. Can take quite a while on weekends so need a bit of patience. Still one of the best crispy prata on this side of Singapore.
Full hawker experience including the long wait time!  Food was great but be ready to stay a bit longer.
"I come to try after read many reviews and not regret it , best prata i ever tried in SG, the curry not too spicy and the dough is tasty and crispy but soft.
Just really need to be patient with the queue , take number first then go around other shop in JooChiat then come back to collect."
Prata was above average but waiting 1.5hrs just to devour it in 10mins is simply not worth the hype. Many cancelled along the way while waiting for their orders. Efficiency and Work processes could grossly be improved
Meh and slow...
I love the prata even though it was a long wait but it's still worth it
Waited 40 mins but worth the wait
"Good crispy prata, but prepare to wait if you go on weekends or Public Holidays. We waited 1.5 hours, finished our food in 20 mins. Not sure will return again unless no crazy long Q"
Best prata in Singapore!
"The prata was good and crispy. Especially the egg one. Requested their sambal and it is the best to mix with curry.

Went there at 10am+ during weekdays and waited for 1 hours+ just for one egg and one plain. Worth the money but definitely not the waiting time.

Advise to go early or otherwise you need to queue for longer time.

Definitely will go again but not at peak hour!

UPDATE : They only sell egg prata, plain prata and mutton curry."
Don't bother coming on weekends/PH after 11am. They will be sold out even since the news. Not sure why didn't plan more dough. Food is good.
The egg prata and mutton not bad but must have the patience to wait at least 1 hour.
"Great Roti's - try the egg, mushroom ones."
"Had an assortment of pratas when I visited - Plaster, CheeseEggOnion, and Cheese. I really enjoyed the texture of the prata here, crispy but with a very tasty dough. Curry was alright.

Stall owners were very kind - seeing that my plaster prata was a little burnt, they immediately gave me another plaster prata in addition to the original one. Grateful for honest business owners like them. Would love to come back again"
"As expected,  prata are crispy and full of fragrance. Went on a weekday morning so don't.have to wait long."
Best Prata in my book. Will order beyond my max calorie intake every time I come here.
"best crispy prata i've had...people queue as early as 7
sambal is a bomb pairing with the prata"
"Very decent crispy-variant prata 

The prata is on the crispy side yet doesn't break like a biscuit, good balance between the fluffiness and the crispiness.

Curry was on a slightly sweeter side, good to have it with the prata though.

At $1.20 a piece, there's nothing to complain about 

Update, Nov '22: tried the mushroom egg variant and it's pretty good too, but would stick to my original one as my go to being the boring me 

Update May'23: Prices seemed to have increased, to $1.30 a piece for the plain ones - still affordable though!"
"Tasty prata! Feels like a home cook recipe. But be prepared to queue very long.

If you ask me I think the standard of prata is good but not unmatchable. it's definitely one of the best at the east area. If you can't afford to wait there are also other chain prata restaurants that are as good but not entirely in the East Coast area. If you have time to wait, I will say must come!"
Rustic place to eat prata. Should be top 2 prata in sg. The other at sin ming blk 24
"Prata. One of my favourite breakfast items, and this one is becoming one of my favourite places for prata!
Yes! The queue is long, but that's to be expected when the food's great!
It's lightly crisp on the outside, but moist, and also lightly chewy on the inside. It's the perfect balance of bite and crunch, without too much sweet nor salty in its flavour.

Couple this with a thick, tangy and spicy fish curry gravy, and every bite is a delight, notwithstanding the fact that the prata itself is already good enough to eat on its own!

Haven't tried it yet? Give it a shot! You won't regret it:)"
Damn Shiok! Best prata in the area and the coffee from the local kopi uncle is good too.
"Prepare to wait for close to an hour for your food to be served. You should try their onion egg prata, generous portion of onions! Though food is great,  I won't queue up again for the 2nd time unless I really have cravings for their prata. Worth to try once since it has pretty good ratings."
"Prata and curry is ""OK"" only, definitely not worth the 40m wait.
PS: don't order hot drinks from this coffeeshop unless what u want is hot water "
best crispy prata kosong in Singapore. its 5 *****
Still taste good despite the founder has passed on. Super long waiting time. So be sure you have thr time to wait. This coffee shop has the worst coffee and has been so for years. LOL
"If u like your prata crispy, then you have to try them."
"One of the best pratas in Singapore. All freshly made upon order and served piping hot. Curry is tangy and delicious we drank it all.

There is a bit of a wait but seats are available so it doesn't feel too long. About 10 minutes wait. Stall owner is friendly and you can ask for curry refills "
Our favourite prata shop!! The plain pratas and coin pratas are the best. Highly recommended.. do expect a wait though.
"Waiting time is 1 hr. Prata ok. Prefer springleaf. More variety and short waiting time.
Won't patronize again unless no or short q."
"Went all the way too Joo Chiat with my friend, and wanted to order but the young lady kept telling me to wait even though there was no customer. She was shouting numbers (which was unhygienic and against food handler rules). They were inattentive and had terrible customer service. Honestly not worth it."
"Love the pratas here! Came here on Saturday early morning, the queue is a bit long and kinda difficult to get a table. They'll give you the queue number after ordering, and you need to remember it."
A recommended place for Prata lovers. The curry that goes along with the prata is no nice that you will go back again
"super crispy pratas as per their name,

coin prata is slightly sweet but not overwhelming. plain prata is slightly dense on the inside, making it pleasantly chewy. sardine murtabak was packed fill of fish, which was pleasantly savoury.

fish curry paired well with everything too, worth the trip down on a week day, lesser queues, more available tables as well"
Prata was good. But they got my order wrong.i paid for 3 plain onion and 1 coin prata. End up got 2 plain and 1 egg 
"Excellent prata..very crispy..less oily and delicious curry.

Only alert, check the waiting time before ordering as it could range between 15 to 30 mins when busy.."
"One of the best roti prata in town and so easily accessible now. Love how crispy the exterior is and still retaining that tad of softness on the inside. The fish curry is the perfect complement to this prata. I love their prata so much that I have it every Saturday. Yep, I'm #4 on the recurring list on Saturday morning."
"Very nice prata. It is crispy, tasty and most importantly not salty. There are long queue in the morning."
"Ordered the egg and plain prata, they are burnt. The prata are crispy, however not really tasty. Biten few pieces of egg shell. Overall, average."
Amazing plain prata and mushroom egg prata. Was crispy and tasty as well. Served with a delicious curry
"1 of the BEST Crispy Prata in SG 

   '    
300 Joo Chiat Road
Tin Yeang restaurant
Singapore 427551
Thur-Tue, 6.30am-1.30pm (Tue till 11am)"
"Extremely cute and crispy coin prata, however they don't accept cash, has a pretty long manual queue system and is in corner coffee shop which has limited ventilation of the oily smell. Generally food is great but in my opinion overwhelmed by the environment."
"Long waiting time and alright prata, certainly not the best prata"
Mrs Moghan and her daughter front the stall now. Mrs Moghan is gracious polite and kind. Her daughter takes after her mother. The pratas are (my personal opinion) the best in Singapore. Crispy with even texture. A joy to eat. Many people recommend the smaller coin pratas - though i hv patronised this stall many times i have yet to try. The curries are also delicious and a wonderful complement to the prata. Strongly recommend everyone to try!
"Long line. It's worth the wait. Roti coin. Quite nice. Thicker and more crispy. Otherwise, it's similar to your proti prata."
Nice and soft. The best I have tasted. Not expensive also. 
Prata is crispy and delicious
"Truly the crispiest (almost crunchy!) prata I've ever had! The texture was so enjoyable and I loved having it with sugar. Curry was just alright~ We waited 40mins when we went at 9am.

Avoid the drinks stall - had the worst and blandest teh c ever."
"Still a mightily satisfying prata meal although the quality has dropped since everyone discovered this stall!
It is not as crispy as before the main man left to meet his Maker, the prata is still one of the better ones in town."
"It's healthier now, lighter and less oily (if you compare to the past). I've been following them since their old location.

Crispy and light prata, had a short queue so didn't wait too long"
Very good prata.
"What a great little place, fast service and the prata's are cheap and amazing - so crispy and tasty"
"Delicious, affordable"
"The Roti prata or Roti Chenai that some might called it, taste real good & crispy. You can order your preferred add-on favour if you like...But frankly speaking the plain prata itself is already taste real good that you will want to come back again.....Just a word of caution...there is always a long queue of customers in front of you especially weekend & it's better that you be there early....or you might face disappointment..of sold out!"
"Waited 45 mins for the prata, but was advise an hour. The prata is good but personally I'm sure there are other places that serve the same quality. The owner/staff is kinda hostile. Talk to her at your own risk."
Probably the best crispy prata you can find in Singapore
My husband & I shared a bowl of fish curry and two prata. When we were finished I wanted to order it all over again. I had cheese and onion prata which was DELICIOUS.
Tried the new stall at the new location in Tin Yeang Coffee Shop. Still as good as ever! Number one Prata in Singapore hands down
Cash only and long wait. No outside food allowed while waiting.
"The crispy Prata here is a must. Plain or with egg, it is all good."
The anchovies sambal chilli really stands out !
Best best best
1 of the best prata place in Singapore.
"Yummy roti and murtabak. But the best was the fish curry that came long to dip my rotis in.
Recently the owner Mr Moghan passed away and now it's Mrs Moghan and family tending and holding up to this fort.
It didn't seem like I waited for an hour at all. Finally got my roti cravings here in Joo Chiat."
"Super long Q, lack of space in the coffeeshop (cos patrons are waiting for food). Thankfully the young lady taking the order gave a fair warning that your order could take up to 1.5 hours. Stars for good attitude & service. This is 9am on Sat morning. I think there are comparable prata places without spending hours in a stuffy humid coffeeshop."
"Delicious prata with lots of filling options and a great curry sauce. If you're looking for something more crispy, the plain prata is just perfect. The food was very fairly priced and we ended up getting coffee from one of the stalls nearby."
The egg prata and curry was solid and its cheap and affordable
"Today it took only 15 minutes for the food to be ready and there was no shortage of seats.
It may be the pre CNY period but a few breakfast stalls at Dunman hawker centre are closed and you'd expect a spillover."
Plaster and sambal and fish curry is the option to try here. Put a bit of everything and eat it in a bite. Yum.
The roti was very crispy and tasty. Unfortunately there was no Mutabark and other Rotis as the Kanban shows.
Nice and crispy prata without being too oily. Curry gravy is nicer than most others. Sambal with ikan bilis is a nice touch.
"Plain prata ($1.20 each) - Warm, crispy, slightly thick prata. The curry had an assam flavour. The wait at lunchtime was 15 minutes."
"Egg prata is excellent, while plain prata is slightly dry."
"You haven't had prata until you try this one. The best by far."" In Singapore.  Crisp and made fresh. Order via the lady owner and wait for your number.  The queens was at #93 and we were given #127, around a 45 minute wait.  Well worth it!"
Seriously I don't know what the hype is about.  Not as nice as others.. and prepare to.wait 30 to an hour
Came all the way from the west to try this famous prata. Didn't disappoint me at all! So crispy and nice! One of the best prata I have eaten. Mrs Mohgan is really friendly too.
Best prata I ever had! Crispy and good weather the prata is still hot or gone cold. The curry is also extremely tasty. Mrs Mohgan is very nice and patient as well! Best prata in singapore hands down.
Pratas are already very good on its own..the sourish fish curry somehow dampen the taste
"Prata was ok, crispy. Waiting time is approx. 1 hour."
Go early to avoid queues. We arrived around 9.30am and waited about an hour for our order. Prata is crispy and flaky. Worth trying prata and murtabak
Good taste. However 1 hour waiting time on weekdays is too much.
One of Singapore's best
"Lives up to all the rave! Crispy but not overly done, yet not oily. Pairs well with the curry which is not too thick or watery.

Mr Mohgan's legacy is continued."
Best Parata place in SG... Tried many varieties and good taste soft n crispy with fish gravy... Good to visit again
"Kosong Prata and Plaster. My favourite prata in Singapore except that the long wait now and morning timing makes it challenging to have it on a regular basis.

June 2022

Kosong Prata + Plaster. One half of the namesake of this super crispy prata place has since pass away so this is like a taste test to see if the offerings have change.  Luckily it still lifts up to its mark except for the plaster egg yolk is a little overcooked."
got the kosong and plaster prata! enjoyed the crispy prata and the sambal & curry accompanied with it. there was a slight waiting time but expected given the crowd but the prata was well worth it!
"Well executed food, but their attitude can be a bit curt. Crispy when you eat there, would not recommend as takeaway.

Probably the best in the Joo Chiat area, but they could afford to be patient since the typical bottleneck is not ordering but cooking.

Wait time is 15 mins or more."
"I recently had the pleasure of trying the Roti Prata and Mutton Murtabak from here, and I must say, it was incredibly delicious. The Roti Prata was perfectly crispy and flaky, and the Mutton Murtabak was bursting with flavor. The meat was tender and perfectly seasoned, and the whole dish was incredibly satisfying. I highly recommend giving them a visit and then walking around the neighborhood with a happy belly."
"Not as crispy as it used to be, same rude arrogant lady shouting when no one come pick up after number appeared, mind you the number board is partially blocked by the pillar."
"Wonderful Prata! Plain Prata is crispy yet not too oily. Even the vegetable curry tastes good too.
The coffee and tea from the coffee shop is expensive yet bland though. Such a spoiler for else a perfect breakfast!"
"Their crispy prata (plain) is highly recommended . The blaster prata is not too bad but i feel its very oily so it is abit jialat.  Found a strand of hair on the prata, please help us improve on the cleanliness. Massive orders from the crowd doesn't mean you compromise the cleanliness. They changed the prata for me so at least the service is good, very sweet family. But worth the try so if you come joo chiat area, please come and visit and order their plain prata!"
Food still great
"Have not taken their prata since 6 yrs ago when I become vegetarian.

Used to patronised Mr & Mrs Mohgan when they were at Poh Ho Kopitiam & the atmosphere there was much better w noodle uncle braised chic feet, young man econ bee hoon w crispy fritters and the loud speaking kopi bro shouting yr order in their hockchew dialect.

The secret of Mr & Mrs Mohgan's prata is their sambal chilli, must request from Mrs Mohgan, then she will give. She used to give freely in previous kpt. Rmb to ask from her in yr next visit."
"Came at around 7am on a Saturday, but yet had to wait for a good 30 mins or more. Prata is however nice and thick and crispy. Just the waiting time kills."
Crispy and fresh prata. Not too oily. Curry is good too.
"Well known for being the best prata in Singapore. Place your order with the lady and she will give you your number to look out for on the LED. Ordered 2 plain pratas ($1.20 each) to try and indeed they live up to their reputation. As the pratas are made-to-order, you can feel the freshness and crispy outer layer with every bite. The insides are soft dough texture with a slight taste of sweetness. Curry is thick and flavorful."
"The coin prata was awesome, love the sweetness there and just nice.
The mushroom cheese prata is my favourite, the cheese is everywhere till the corner of the prata that doesn't make me feel like it's a plain prata at the side.
Love their plaster prata, the combination of the egg and the prata is just nice. 
Will definitely come back again "
"best prata that I ever try!
however need to waiting for 30 minutes to get it"
"28 Oct 2022: Here again for the crispy prata...waiting time is about 15 minutes.

05 Jun 2022: Super crispy outside, soft and fluffy inside...one of the best place for prata in Singapore. Fish curry is a little weak but the sambal (with ikan bilis) made a perfect alternative. The queue time can be crazy and make sure to lookout for your order number from the digital number display.

Mr & Mrs Mohgan Prata is now at a coffe shop in Joo Chiat (Tin Yeang Restaurant, 300 Joo Chiat Road}"
Yikes would give it a better rating if I didnt have to wait 1.5hrs for my prata. Definitely the best prata in Singapore. I don't think many come close.
"Kindly note someone has been altering the address quite frequently.

Real Address: 300 Joo Chiat Rd, Singapore 427551

Freshly prepared Prata; very crispy. My usual order comes with egg onion Prata, kosong Prata, fish curry and samba chill. I would mix the samba with curry to make it spicier. Do come early to avoid the crowd. Even if you can't find a seat, do place an order first because it will take quite some time for them to prepare."
can eat but definitely not worth for the long q
Crispy and fresh all the time. All time favourite prata in this neighbourhood
"One of the best prata in the Joo Chiat area and made consistently with a small crew. Be prepared to wait up to 45 mins during peak hours like the weekend mornings.

The fish curry was delicious and compliments the wide selection of pratas. We had the coin, egg & cheese and kosong. The coin was a tad too sweet, the egg and cheese was done perfectly. The melted cheese complimented the prata very well.

The kosong prata was crispy on the edges and fluffy on the inside. All in all great place for your prata cravings.

1 major con was the missing complimentary drinks. The coffee shop serves typical local coffee and tea rather than the spread of teh tariks"
Crispy and Chewy. Everything you want in a Prata. They deserve an award for their roti for sure.
"Great food.
Friendly lady boss."
this is really good! prata + savory curry 
Crispy coin prata.  Yummy curry.  Perfect.
"I am not sure why I have never been here to eat, since its quite near where I live.

Finally get to eat the prata here. It is really cripsy and soft at the same time. Curry is sour and just a tad spicy. Just kick to it. Really popular too. Will come back again soon!"
Small stall selling local prata. Crispy when taken hot. The plain prata taste better then the egg in my visit. Revisited the place. Not as good as before but still the prata are fresh.
"We went for lunch around 1pm on a Friday, no queue. Food was super delicious, service however was not as friendly as expected. The coin prata was the signature and my favourite, quite crispy and flaky and tasty. Any prata order came with a side of gravy, which had a bit of subtly sweet and sour tamarind taste. There were 6 coin prata in a portion, and these were really small in size so I could easily devour 2 portions in a row without being full. The plain prata was also yummy, there was a wide range of prata flavours to choose from."
"Best roti I've had. Such good flavour in the prata itself.
Terrible ordering system though - they wrote down orders but didn't follow up, so several people, us included, had to remind them to do our order."
" Best Prata in Singapore   (located in coffee shop that serves the worst coffee), please go diagonally opposite the junction, Kohi Roastery & Coffee Bar (A Hole In The Wall, 283 Joo Chiat Road) for your beverages/coffee "
So fluffy! I loveeee the pratas here 
"Fluffy and crispy prata. Especially love their coin prata. Location is still the same at joo chiat. Opening hours are still the same, closed on Wednesday."
"I had not searched for this place and did not hear about it. We just happened to stop at the coffeeshop for lunch. This haa got to be the best roti prata I had in a long while.
The plain prata was light and yet crunchy on the outside. The curry was good too. Hubby had the Murtbak, and he was happy with it. We had to wait, but not really too long. Will return for sure."
"Search best prata in Sg. You'll probably see this.
What can I say. There's prata shop at every corner in Sg. To find a good one, not easy. To have your name that keeps popping out is also not easy. Highly recommended."
The plain prata is surprisingly crispy and tasty with the curry. Also enjoyed the onion prata with egg and onion prata with cheese. Bravo!
First time tried this food. 
"Not oily, super fluffy and flaky. Almost like a flat crossiant. Delicious. But be prepared to wait an hour!"
"Excellent, crispy plan prata, with a consistent fish curry gravy to boot. There will be some waiting time, but Mr and Mrs Mohgans has shown to be consistent so far."
"Really extraordinary prata that they have. It is crispy on the outside and easy to cut into small bite sizes. Most importantly, it does not leave a  strong doughy after taste."
Favourite prata! Enough said
Awesome food at affordable price
Very nice and crispy Prata.  Also not oily too.
"Prata is super crispy and tasty, fluffy yet not overly oily. I really loved the fish curry, which complemented with the crispy prata so well it keeps me wanting for more. Ordered the plain prata and coin prata and definitely must order the coin prata! 6 pieces of small crispy prata with sugar inside really perks up the morning!"
The coin and onion+egg pratas were amazing!
It's name has changed by its food remained the same...good and delicious 
Crispy delicious yum. Love the slight tang in their curry too
Curry for prate is very tasty and service is good.
"Prata lover here. And this is one place I would definitely visit again. Queue can be quite long though (but you will be given a number, then when it's called come and collect your food). Ordered plain prata and coin prata. Both were good. Very crispy dough on the outside and soft on the inside. Curry was good as well. We asked for fish curry. Coin prata set comes with mutton curry. And based on the reviews, we tried their sambal as well. Really good and tasty!"
"Attempted to visit this stall at 808 Circuit Rd, Singapore 379496 on 1 Jul 2022. Was utterly shocked that with the recent reviews shown, the stall is actually not located at the specified location."
"Very nice prata, tasty dough, good balance of fluffy and crispy, and goes well with the tangy fish curry. I also tried their sambal and it added an extra kick. Will definitely be back."
"We went at 6:30 am and was given queue number 10. The egg prata is nice and goes well with the fish curry. Surprising that their coin prata has added sugar which we don't like it as much. Overall it's okay but I won't purposely return for prata.

P.s. avoid the brew drinks at that kopitiam, terrible over sweet drain water teh o bing."
Good and cheap food. Now that they have more staff the wait is no longer do long
"Old school good crispy prata. If not for the curry which was a tad watery, would have rated 5 stars. Almost everyone in the coffee shop was eating the prata. Service was okay too."
Incredible
1 of the best prata indeed.. the crispy is just nice.. not too oily. Mutton curry is my preference too. Sambal chili a nice kick.
My favourite prata place here in Singapore. Crispy and yummy as what an awesome prata should be!
Is the location at 80 Circuit Road still valid? Could not find the shop at this food center.
"Very good! Come during weekday morning, shorter queue.

They are still at 300 Joo Chiat road, don't get fooled by the revised location and timings."
Really crispy. Satisfied my prata cravings
"Crispy, reasonable price and friendly auntie. Has been eating the prata for years"
"Mr&Mrs is at 300 Joo Chiat Rd, Singapore 427551. Is open every AM except Tuesday.

Updated yet again - the Prata remains same high quality despite Mr Mohgan passing away.  Only change is the curry is noticeably more ""floury"" and thicker - some may like: I don't.     The tea and coffee served by Tin Yeang is also the WORST in Singapore (a thin dish-water like liquid) so bring own water"
Always a nice place for breakfast
Prata n curry is nice 
"Travelled 30 mins here just to try the prata, and it was well worth the journey. It was incredibly delicious. The prata is crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. And it tastes amazing when paired with the fish curry. I've never tried coin prata before but that was also fantastic. The daughters (I think?) were taking orders and were very polite. Highly recommend visiting here.

I came on a Monday 10:30am and didn't have to wait long for the prata (cooked fresh). There was no queue to order."
"Visited on a Friday morning. It was a short but reasonable wait for the prata. It is not as crispy as anticipated. About $1.20 for a plain prata, about the same price as other prata stalls."
"First visit here after Mr. Mohgan's passing

The prata seems a little different but still good enough for me.

Given time I suppose it will get better."
Had to get up early but soonest we could get there was around 9 maybe 9:30 am to Mr. Mohgan because I read they ran out of coin prata  by 10 am.... they were already out of coin prata. The curry was mediocre. They did not have many choices for prata. The prata were really nice and crunchy. Thankful I got to taste their food.
Best prata in Singapore JB and some say universe.
The prata is still as great and warmth of Mr Mohgan remains.
Hands down the best Prata in Singapore... but sadly... R.I.P Mr Mohgan...
"Finally after 3 attempts to try their prata! Even then, waited for almost 45 mins for the prata. It was certainly one of best prata around. It's crispy and tasty even on its own.

The fish gravy was so so though. What really was the icing on the ""prata"" was the sambal chilli. It's a little spicy and goes well with the crispy prata!

And despite their busyness, Mrs Mohgan was still friendly."
"Having their prata as breakfast always make a great start of my day. Crispy! I always ask for mutton curry (else you will be given fish curry). & their sambal chilli... the combi is sooo good.

They increased their price after these years. But it still very worth.

Usually visit on weekday morning 7am+. Prata will be ready before I finish my drink."
"The auntie is cute and friendly. Thanks for the nice service and good thing they have the ""pager device"" to notify when your order is ready coz it can be a long wait.
The food ? Just so-so. Pratas were crispy but not crispy enough to cause a stir. Curry was ok. Not sure what the hype was about."
Famous prata. Worth ur time if u r in the neighbourhood. Delicious local cuisine which is inexpensive too.
"Popular prata stall near my place, tried it twice just to be sure.
Prata is strong but the curry is weak. Perhaps this is a balance of things. In honesty when you put the 2 together it is still quite harmonious, but somehow you come away feeling that if only the curry is a little better..."
"Monday morning 930am, not much wait (less than 15mins). 2 pax, 3 kosong bawang + 1 kosong, 1 fish curry + 1 mutton curry. Yummy!! Crispy, freshly made, thickness just right, & not too oily. Only S$5.50, going value & quality. Thumbs up!"
"best prata in Singapore! though there's always a queue, it's worth the wait! I'd wake up early just for it!"
"Finally tried this prata on a weekend early morning at 7am. We had to wait for at least 45 min to 1 hour for our order to be ready. Thankfully, we were not famished.

The food arrived and we were pleasantly surprised by the crispy texture of this prata. Spouse had cheese prata and onion prata. I had plain prata. We finished our meal in 10 minutes. 

It was nice experience. However, we would rather go to other prata shop that offers quicker service."
Still crispy but somehow less buttery or savoury than what I used to experience. Overall still ok. Maybe cos I Forgot to ask for fish curry cos their dahl curry is a bit too plain for my liking
"Excellent coin Pratas, crispy and delicious. Unfortunately they don't always have them and if you go mid morning, there's an hour wait before you get your food (although they're good about letting you know if there's a long wait time.) I recommend going early and be prepared to wait a while for a table since you're limited with seating only in twos."
"Since my last review, the stall had moved to this new location at junction of Joo Chiat Road and Dunman Road. Crowd is back again. And I am bumping up the rating.

The prata is always crispy here, even the egg prata which tends to get soggy after a while. That's because of very high turn over rate. No chance for the roti to get soggy.

Love their sambal with ikan bilis for the extra kick. However, the downside is that fish curry is a bit flat. Overall still satisfying.

Prepare for a long wait. Even on a weekday morning, there were 23 orders before mine gets served."
Prata guy on tiktok
"Quite so so prata when compared to other stalls around Singapore. Ordered a mutton murtabak and 2 piece of plain prata. Overall price is around 20% cheaper than most well known prata places, but there is a catch - quality.

The plain prata was not exactly crispy and there are parts that are somewhat ""doughy"" and still a smidge undercooked. The mutton murtabak should be extremely flavourful (because of the meat). However, the meat was an underwhelming and texture-less mess. To complete the prata destruction, the curry was somewhat thin and also lack much taste.

I rarely have a very high carb meal due to dietary planning (but I very much still do enjoy a high carb meal). This unfortunately will never make it to my list of ""cheat meals"" ever."
Crispy prata! One of the best!
Delicious and crispy prata as usual.
"Lesser waiting time, as crispy as before.   "
The most crispy prata I ever eaten. Coin prata is definitely a must try. But the curry is abit blend. Come early to wait as they are extremely popular!
"One of the best pratas around but only if you can wait for 45 minutes or more.  Go for the fish curry.

If you are hungry while you wait there is the wonton or the economic noodle stalls."
"Not the crispest prata I have had. Nice balance of crispy and chewy, without being too oily. Service is good, despite being very busy. Systematic queue system. Very reasonable pricing. In summary, we waited about 20 mins and it is worth it."
Still amongst the best pratas
Very nice. Waited for 65 mins while I reached at 930am. 1050 sold out . Chilli is a must try w prata. I'll come in earlier to beat the q.
Superb prata and their curry sauce is signature. Be prepared to wait if they are short handed.
"Very noce aunty - extremely terrible product. Only crispy - but the curry and the prata dough have literally no taste. Not worth the wait, not worth the money."
"Waited 1.5 hours just to eat 1 kosong and 1 with egg. The curry was watery, and more like potato flavoured soup with curry colouring. Not coming back. It's hype."
"The cute Indian Aunty asked us to be patient for the order. Well we did. And it was worth waiting 1 hour plus on a lazy Sunday morning. Crispy prata and nice curry! But if you are in a rush, place the order and run your errands first! Be back in a hour to enjoy your prata!"
"Wow I was really amazed, not by the prata but by the waiting time!
Arrived and the coffee shop looked so peaceful and no queue in front of the stall. I didn't know almost everyone one sitting in the coffee shop was actually waiting for their pratas! The 1st disappointment I had was they only served plain and egg prata, which they have put a notice saying lack of manpower. And I can't believe it that it took 1 hour and 40 mins to get 2 plain 2 egg pratas served on the table! Ordering time was less than 5 mins and we were thinking ""OK this is going to be pretty fast"" and we were so wrong.
The plain prata was pretty decent, crispy but a little too thick. What I really enjoyed was the egg prata, I could cut open the prata and see the thick egg layer on it. I was wondering if they put more than 1 egg or what? The feeling is almost like the egg in the mac muffin which made the prata really so satisfying.
Quite an experience for the wait, not sure if will go back again on a weekday or find other places to try instead. Was really expecting to try more flavours..."
"Prata is crispy but on the smaller side, could only order egg and plain due to manpower shortage(?) Lady at the counter was also not in the best of moods, but it is what it is.

Might come back again on a weekday~~~"
"No doubt waiting time is definitely long. The pratas are made to order and indeed are very crispy. However, personal preference are for the more chewy type of prata. Auntie is very nice!"
"The place closes at 1PM or when the dough sells out, so I think that explains why even at 10AM, my order was 16th in the queue, and the wait was about half an hour or so. I like that there is a number board system, where you're assigned a queue number once you've ordered, so you can probably gauge the waiting time.

Price is relatively cheap, $7 total for 1 mushroom cheese, 2 egg and 1 kosong prata. But even with this low price, I probably won't patronize this stall again. I probably shouldn't comment too much on the prata itself, cause I ate it late, it was a takeaway order, so if it was crispy, it definitely wasn't by the time I ate.

But the down side for me, reason for the minus 2 stars, was the curry. Sadly, the curry was bland/diluted and not at all spicy. This was definitely a meal I did not enjoy at all.

Edit:
Up another star, cause friend convinced me that the prata is really awesome, just that the curry isn't good. I accept that. So, to be fair, if you're really into the curry for your dough, this really isn't the place for you. But if you're good with sugar or without, then this might just be the place for you."
"Heard so much about this being the #1 prata but honestly it is not worth the wait. Waited for more than 50min for the prata, asked for fish curry. But the curry we got is obviously not fish curry and lady boss keeps telling us it is fish curry. There was only this curry and sambal available at the stall. I don't think anyone should find potato in fish curry right? Because there's potato in the curry she called fish curry. It'd be nice if she just told us upfront there is no fish curry today.
Anyway putting the curry aside, we have definitely tasted better crispier pratas elsewhere too."
"I can say this is the best prata in SG, even better than some JB prata also

A pity I stay in the North, otherwise I could eat it almost daily "
Still one of the best pratas around! Must order the plaster and coin prata (only available on weekdays)
"I live in the neighbourhood so I might be biased, but I genuinely believe this is one of the best places to have thoroughly enjoyable prata that's crispy yet not hard nor overly greasy. Many customers also overlook the fact that the mutton curry is super tasty and tender, and goes extremely well with the prata. You shouldn't just settle for the dhal that's given. Yes, the wait can be horrendously long, and would definitely test even the most patient of people. If you're keen to give it a try, go with the kosong and plaster, with the mutton curry as accompaniment."
"Best Prata in SG.
1 hour waiting time"
"Wow, I'm amazed by how incredibly rude the lady owner was. Plenty of ignoring and resentful shouting to go with your prata. Yums."
Food is excellent. Bad service. Two hour wait. Breakfast became lunch.
"Reached at 11am on Sun, lady at the counter was very rude when she told me the prata was sold out. Most tables also did not have food yet. Don't recommend."
"As a carbs lover, I really love Mr Mrs Mohgan's prata - one of the best prata places I've ever tried!

Been an hour since I ordered my takeaway on a Sat morning at 8am - I recommend to head over earlier to avoid the busy period!"
My favorite place for pratas. Have been eating their pratas the past 6 yrs since they were at Onan Road. So nice of Mrs.Mohgan to ask how my son is doing. Great pratas. Prepare for long wait time on weekends.
"I'm left with slightly mixed feelings after this highly anticipated visit.

It's a Tuesday morning, the wait was approximately 40 minutes. According to my mother who frequents, the waiting time is considered relatively kind. I've no fuss about it because I came mentally prepared for the wait, and the coffee shop's environment was relatively pleasant.

For two persons, I ordered 5 kosong for $5 - a fair price considering how popular this stall is. When I dug in, I immediately understood what made it popular. It was crispy without being hard and retained a slight doughy softness in the middle. In my opinion, it's a rare feat in Singapore.

But here's why I didn't enjoy it as much as I would like to: as I finished my second Prata, I noticed how I was starting to find it suffeiting - a little disappointing considering how the Prata is already made a tad smaller than most. The dhal wasn't quite enjoyable too. As a doughy Prata person, this wasn't convincing enough.

Would I recommend? Yes, but only to those I am certain will enjoy crispy versions of Prata."
Not bad but not to wait for 1 1/2 to 2 hrs for the roti prata
Super delicious prata! Crispy and not oily. Worth the wait.
Long queue
"Love the prata! Ordered plaster prata, egg prata and plain prata. Came here on a Thu morning and the wait wasn't long. There were 14 numbers before me in the queue and it was less than 30 mins wait. Will definitely revisit but probably not during weekend."
Best prata ever!
"My 3rd visit here, the pratas were lovely. Hot and crispy off the grill, every prata is cooked upon order by the owner, so expect waiting times ~20 mins(for context, I came at 10am on a weekday). Had the quintessential order; 2x egg and 1x kosong. Sambal was great and added a savory kick without being overly spicy. Curry was unfortunately diluted and lacked any discernable oomph. Worth a visit if you're in the vicinity, adjust your expectations accordingly!"
"Always good prata
I would be eating here every day if not for the very grumpy uncle and auntie tandem. Always angry. Though understand its part of the charm of the place, just really always yelling. One uncle non stop smokes"
"Fluffy and absolutely crispy, the curry is also fragrant and memorable. But i would prefer Sin Ming Roti prata if it's based on taste.

Still among the best of crispy pratas "
Que is super long and the wait is never ending. Be prepared to wait for at least 45mins.
Two and a half hour queue for a pretty bad prata. Curry is diluted and the prata is so doughy like eating rubber band. Totally unnecessary hype.
"Sunday 745am.  Queue number 19, I ordered and was given 58.  Waited about 1.5 hours, queue at 40.  Cancelled my order and left.  Best avoid on weekends unless you have absolutely nothing better to do"
A must go place whenever you visit Singapore. The best roti prata in my experience. Get there early to beat the queues
"Arrived on a Sunday at around 11.30am (thinking we were avoiding the early morning crowd). Got number 125, current number was 101. Luckily got a table straight away. It was not a terrible wait, as the shop was comfortable and we could quench our thirst and hunger with coffee and vadai (I truly recommend snacking on these!). About an hour later at 12.25, we got our pratas. They were the crispy kind, which I like, but overall quite underwhelming. All things considered - especially the wait time, I'd give it a 3/5."
"Prata kosong is the best and very shiok, plaster prata not memorable, prata coin is a bit sweet for my taste, fish curry is so so (will be better if it is more sour and diluted).

Reach there around 7.30am and got queue no. 45 (while they served up to queue no. 22), waiting time a bit long just for prata, food court is clean and safe distancing during current covid situation is well observed."
The Best roti prata n friendly too.
Still my favourite prata!
Queues are long but overall worth the wait.  Plain prata and coin prata are the most crispy.
Nice crispy plain prata. 1 of few prata shop in singapore give sambal with curry.
Simply nice
"After being hyped by TikTok videos, I went to visit the place, but I was disappointed to hear ""auntie got fish curry, mutton curry only, auntie got no vegetarian curry"" from auntie.

Location: 9/10
Cleanliness: 4/10
Food: no-idea/10"
"One of the best prata places in SG, but is the queue worth it? A resounding yes!
Crispy, flavourful and authentic. You can't go wrong with prata here. The curry is also fantastic, with generous portions of potato.

Expect at least an hours queue even on a weekday morning. Probably the only reason why it's not 5 stars is because:
1. Not so convenient location
2. The kopi at coffeeshop is not good"
Delicious. But waiting time abit long.
must order the prata. Plain was super crispy!
"This is my first time trying the prata and I had the plain and egg prata, with the default curry dahl. Both plain and egg prata were decent but nothing so special that justify the 45min wait. The curry dahl was flat and plain. The worst of all....? The extremely rude and unpleasant Mrs Moghan. I greated her with a cheery ""hello! I like to have..."" and she snapped before I could finish my order... WHAT HELLO? CAN'T YOU SEE I M BUSY RIGHT NOW? This is my first and last time here. There are many other places that serve good prata without the stinking attitude."
"Freshly pressed and tossed, crispy on the outside and fluffy inside, no wonder Mr Mrs Mohgan has been constantly rated as the best prata in Singapore. A DESTINATION in itself, it's a hawker stall at Tin Yeang Coffee Shop in the heart of Joo Chiat Peranakan enclave.

With >30 years of making prata dishes from scratch, definitely it helps cementing Singapore's hawker fare in UNESCO's Intangible Culture List.

However, if you have no patience for waiting for an average of 60 to 90 minutes for your prata, even at 700am in the morning, go elsewhere."
"First try on their Coin Prata.
Absolutely yummy... it's light, crisps, tasty (with a slight sweetness), perfect when dipped into the curry."
Have to wait awhile but its worth it. Surprisingly I enjoyed the curry more than the prata
Love the prata but long que
"Hands down our fav prata place. Crispy AND fluffy at the same time. The curry isn't the best prata curry I've had but the good prata more than makes up for it. You can get chilli too if you ask; was told this is very Malaysian from a fellow prata eater who shared a table with us once.

Get there early especially on weekends if you want have a shorter wait (and because they usually sell out by 11.30 or noon). But the usual is about 1-1.5 hours when we go. I've waited as short as 20 mins before (super pleasantly surprised), to more than 2 hours. It's still worth it to us. We bring books to read or get a bite to eat from the other stalls whole we wait."
"Lucky me, the queue is not long today. I got my prata within 10 min from order. The prata is fresh and goes well with the fish  curry and sugar. The price is very reasonable too."
"In current covid times, no chance to dine in so takeaway was the only choice.
Yes, bringing it home to eat, don't expect it to be crispy, but taste wise, ok.  The curry was well ok too.
It was more affordable compared to the more 'popular, branded pratas'.
Hope to come back and dine in to taste the crispy-ness."
Prepare for a long wait. Order from table in front of stall and watch your number being displayed and called.
"Easily my favourite prata stall in Singapore.

Run by a couple they serve only till their ingredients finish and then pack up and go home.

Crispy on the outside. Soft on the inside.

Always ask for their sambal and if you're a fan of mutton their mutton curry is excellent!

Be prepared to wait - usually about an hour depending the queue!

Must try."
Very friendly owners
Nice prata cooked upon order. Will need to wait 15-30min though as it's very popular.
"First time having prata for lunch here, and turn out to be a great decision. No long wait like during the mornings and the banana, and onion & egg prata we ordered were all nice, light and crispy. :)"
super good prata! Come early
"Guys, get their mutton curry WITH MUTTON. You will never regret it, yo."
Best prata in town currently for me especially the coin prata. The downside is I waited an hour in the queue.
Best prata I've had. I got the coin prata ($5) and it was super crispy with a slight sugary taste. The prata is great by itself or with the small serving of curry to dip.
"Went on a Friday morning around 6.50am, it was pretty empty. Ordered and waited for about 15mins for the prata.

Ordered 3 eggs and 1 plain. PLAIN PRATA IS SUPER GOOD! If you are there for the crispy prata, just order the plain one. Cause it's nicer.

The egg prata wasnt as crispy, well because there's an egg. Nevertheless it was still yummy. Lucky we didn't have to wait too long. Awesome!"
Traditionally and great. Also reasonably priced!
"Not as nice as previous location.
Roti are still crispy but the sauce wasn't right somehow.
Hope it will be improve."
"Consider good, but based on their famous brand, I expected a bit more. But still good."
Best prata in SG
Had the coin prata and plain prata. Coin Prata is still super crispy after 30 mins in package. Mutton Curry is thick and flavourful.
"RUDE. SLOW. INEFFICIENT.
There are places where you can get crispier prata without having to face the lady's bad attitude or having to waste an hour of your time on a couple bucks worth of common prata"
Bloody rude lady Manning the order counter...Bad attitude.....
Prata is quite good although  i still prefer springleaf prata.
"crisp n not light(not oily) ,dip into their fish curry is just perrrfect. Worth the wait."
"Plain and coin prata was so good and crispy. The wait was soo long, around 1 hour wait. Order first then wait for seats."
"Finally tried one of the top 10 prata in Singapore! Waited an hour or so but seems organised. Only thing is getting a table, you'll see lots of tables occupied with people just having drinks but they are actually waiting for prata. This coffee shop is typically eat and go, no point hoarding the tables talking and chatting like fine dining, unless you wanna be given the killer stares or dirty looks. The auntie at prata stall is pleasant, dunno why people said she's rude, but she's busy writing orders and serving, acting as cashier herself. Nope, she's definitely not rude, in fact think she's kind. Attitude begets attitude, if that's what some people are complaining. The prata itself is nice, crispy and freshly made. Ordered the coin, kosong and egg prata. Only thing is the fish and mutton curry can do better. Tastes kinda diluted and the kick is just not there. However, the consolation is they also provide ikan bilis sambal which adds to the taste. By the way, the coin prata is a bit on the sweet side."
"Their prata kosong is really crispy. Curry is good but the best part is they have sambal chillies sauce to go with your prata, just like in Malaysia! Just ask for it."
Friendly store and fresh Prata.
"Excellent prata. Can say easily beat Jalan Kayu one nowadays. Kayu ones are a big disappointment as I've tried recently. Mrs Mohgan's consistently excellent.

But I won't queue for more than an hour. I can understand why other folks do it. It's one of the best in Spore.

Prata kosong is crispy yet not too hard and dry. And not too oily too. Sambal is excellent. Curry is not bad."
"Prata is first class: hot, crispy, not oily. Had the egg, mushroom, cheese and onion prata ($4) while my two friends had Kosong and egg ($3) each. Regretted not buying two cuz of the long wait and felt hungry again after 2 hours (exercised before brunch). Warning: be prepared to wait 1 hour if you're going on weekend for brunch/lunch (Only reason why I didn't give 5 ). Auntie who took our orders was friendly (called my friend sayang.  contrary to some reviews online)."
"<Pros>
Super crispy prata
Rich butter taste
<Cons>
far from MRT station
Long waiting time
Curry is a bit watery

"Forget about this place - went there as a first time customer and got scolded by the Indian auntie for not knowing the system. Asked her how to go about ordering and she said ""WHAT DO YOU WANT? DONT ASK SO MANY QUESTIONS!"", when I literally asked only one question on ""how to order"" as I really had no idea. Waiting time was 1.5 hours. Not coming back here ever."
"Not worth the queue. Will not go again if queuing is required.

Went down at 7:50 in a Saturday morning, was informed the queue was 40 mins. Actually waited 50 mins to get the food.

The pratas were crispy but nothing else. Had tried plain, egg and mushroom. The cheese was good, it was using the real sliced cheese. The accompany curry was so so, very watery and the favours are not rich. Totally not worth queuing such long time. If there is no one queuing I probably will go and eat.

Ordered take away too and it was crispy stills. Of course not as much as dining in. The portion is smaller compre to other Indian stalls.

Not worth queuing. It's just a bit more cripta than the ordinary prata but have to queue almost 1 hour. Totally not worthy. Time should be spent much more wisely."
"Curry taste is nice. But portion is small, not that worth for almost an hour long queue."
"The queue was quite long as only the aunty is doing the taking order and packing the food and gravy. So can start to order while waiting for seat, always ask seated customers are they still waiting for prata so to avoid empty hope.
The plain prata was slight crisp with chewy dough not the oil very crispy kind. Egg prata was nice as well. Gravy I had fish curry was alright nothing out of norm."
Be prepared to wait if you're there for breakfast.
"Heard about this place and wanted to support. Unfortunately it was not the experience I hoped for. Stood in front of the shop to order, waited 5 mins while the lady walked in and out blatantly ignored me. Got shouted at when I approached her to order. Was rudely told to wait for our number. Never got to try the prata, was only served a cold dish of arrogance, hostility, rudeness and bad customer service. Highly NOT recommended!"
"This review should be zero stars.

Having just relocated back to Singapore, heard great reviews about this place so decided to visit today. The lady owner was busy so we waited patiently for about 5 mins as we wanted to get takeaway. When she looked like she was free we tried to order and she shouted at me ""98!"" No idea what she meant so I asked her to repeat herself and she shouted at me again ""take number!"" We took a number and waited for our turn and it was at this point that she started mumbling under her breath ""uneducated people.""

Without a doubt one of the worst customer service experiences ever. We did not know there was a number system, there was no need to be so rude. Just because I am tattooed does not make me an uneducated person. I called her out on it and she denied it of course. If you have the guts to say it, have to guts to own up to it.

Blatantly rude and no courtesy. Will never return."
"Good crispy pratas and well seasoned curry. Add their sambal for that extra spice and deliciousness. Grab a seat, order your food, get a number and your number to be called when your food is ready."
"Probably not worth to travel all the way for this but if you are around the area, not trying this wonderful prata is a crime."
"Lady boss takes her personal frustration out on customer. Knew she was busy, said hi as was being ignored for couple of minutes silently waiting(she was just arranging plastic bags at this point) . After that politely asked if I can order. Got snapped at. Do not owe you a living. Will never patronise again"
The prata is good ! But quite a fair bit of waiting.
Prata was nice! The curry can be better and there needs to be more alternatives. But it was worth the wait!!
Star of the show is the coin prata.
"On weekends and public holidays, come at dawn or prepare to wait 1 hour plus for your order."
The Indian stall beside Me Mrs Mohgan sells great prawn vada. Give it a try!  :D
"For the wait definitely overrated. The prata was crispy and not overly oily and the curry was decent. But to be 30 something in the queue before 7 am, the prata doesn't trump extra sleep.. Would definitely rate higher when productivity improves"
friendly people! prata is really crispy and fragrant.
I like how crispy the prata is!
"To die for. Friendly auntie makes the waiting bearable. Prata-wise, i guess we can conclude based on the long queues"
Great prata! Plain prata is light and crispy! Definitely worth a return.
Try the prata it was good but without the chilli it's was jus a normal Prata.......As I ask them for the chill..there was no i respond until after packing was done den said that plain NVR come with chilli...whats the difference?..where as older sellers provided chilli no Matter the amount is...poor service n food taste going down
"waited almost 2 hours for the prata (not bad but curry very watery and diluted), but saw the staff serving the angmoh first even though there was a lot of people who ordered earlier, very disappointed to see such actions in Singapore. will definitely not come back again, not worth the wait, and they dont value their local customers. alot of elderly waited patiently for their queue number but when angmoh unhappy they quickly serve them first."
"Bad experience, waited 2 hrs for the prata but saw a Caucasian family who came much much later to be served their food first when they went to ""complain"" when everyone else was waiting patiently for the food.
prata was not bad, but the curry very diluted, definitely not worth the wait. The Vadai and the wonton mee at the coffee shop is much better"
Gotta go very early to queue.. if not abt an hr wait
"It will be better if you find your seat first then join the queue for order. The friendly lady boss will tell you the queue then you need to wait in your seat. You can pay and collect the prata after your number is called.
It is quite hard to get the seat so be ready to wait next to the table which looks like going to finish.
The prata is crispy and the curry is delicious. The lady boss is friendly and quite attentive.
You can just order your drinks from the drink stall from the table while waiting. The coffee is average but the tea is below standard."
"This morning was exceptionally packed with customers for their prata! We had waited 70 minutes and finished the prata in 5 minutes! 

Definitely worth the wait! Prata was crispy, plaster egg yolk was ozing and their sambal mixed with curry bring it to next level! Seriously good!"
I am a person who doesn't eat prata. But this place here really makes you craving for more once you have tried their pratas! Really crispy especially their plain. A must try
"6 star quality, 1 star waiting time."
Great place for breakfast!
"We ordered the kosong, plaster and coin prata. The coin and kosong are crispy and full of buttery flavor. My hubby really liked the plaster. Personally, I like prata to have the crisp outer layer, and soft doughy interior. So my gripe is that the prata doesn't have the soft interior that I so like. It's a personal thing for me. Also, curry is okay only, abit watered down imo. You'd have to wait around 30 mins for your prata. While waiting try the vadai shop (2 shops down), they gave me freshly fried vadai, so it was v nice. The fried chicken drumlet was good too. If you like chicken innards, you can try too. It's not a thing for me, but the hubs liked it."
"Good curry, good mutton, good prata. Coin prata just ok. Nice egg chili onion"
"Great prata!
but the Google listing address for Mr and Mrs Mohgan's Prata seems to be wrong... should be 300 Joo Chiat Road"
Best plata in the east
"Basically an indian version of Cong You Bing
Had the original and the egg one
Original is definitely very crispy and did not disappoint
Price point also very reasonable, and the lady was very kind
Loved the kick of the sambal sauce - highly recommend if you can take the heat
Line is long thought - went at 10am on a thursday and still had to wait 15-20 minutes
Definitely worth a visit if you have the time!"
Crispy crispy roti... and great curry.
Expect to queue up to 1 hour for ur prata.. very crispy.
"Is tasty but it would be good to further exercise the prata before hitting the iven plate.
Curry can be further improved too"
Simply delicious. Had a plaster and egg onion with fish curry and sambal.
Crispy crisp as the stall name depicted. . And the mutton curry was flavourful!
The kosong prata is crispy on the edges and light and airy inside. Now imagine that with an egg plaster with some runny yolk. Mix all these with their curry and you get great satisfaction. My only complaint is that the place is crowded and its a very long wait for the prata.
"I find the prata so so and really not worth the queue. If you really want to order, go for the kosong and coin prata. The rest is just meh"
"Nicest Prata couple ever! We tried the egg prata and the coin prata. Egg Prata - crispy  on the outside, soft on the inside. Coin Prata was amazing and unforgettable! It was super crispy and soaked up the fish curry. Thinking of these just makes us drool! We will be coming back for more!!"
Best paratha in Singapore
Crispy and nice curry.
"Deserve the 5 star, Good service. A1."
"Friendly & nice lady serving, the long queue and with Queing/Call system. Mutton Curry better. Be prepared to wait at least half hour. Kopi also good here. Next stall Wantan Mee (order Black Sauce better) their Dumpling (Shui Jiao) better than wanton."
Nice Curry. They sell Coin Prata too. Come early as queue is long and hard to get tables.
Prata is gd n the owner is very polite!
"Prata is crispy and tasty; but wouldn't say it's way better than other prata stores.

Expect a half hour wait at least.

The Mohgans are so friendly!"
"The Roti Prata ($1) is nice and crispy although the size is not big. The Egg Prata ($1.50) is nice too and both pare very well with the fish curry. The lady boss is very friendly and after you ordered the food she will let you know your queue number. Once your number is called, proceed to collect and make payment. Do expect a full house when your come during peak morning hour. Love the atmosphere of the old time traditional coffee shop."
Noti prada good.  Have to wait.
Excellent prata....but gotta be early and patient
Had to wait for 20 min before prata is served on a Saturday morning. Ordered a set of coin prata which came in 5 pieces for $5. Prata was crispy and nice. Take note that it has sugar coating on the prata though. I thought it would be nicer without the sugar. Fish curry was alright. Overall the prata was good.
Very nice to eat
"You won't get more politely served prata in Singapore... oh and it's pretty good too! Go for the 'kosong' (no egg) version for a crispy prata.  Prata is made to order so expect at least a 30min wait, and they shut before lunch so get there early!"
Very crispy prata but the queue very lomg(1hr) make sure you go early
real hot and crispy coin prata accompanied by awesome fish curry. downside is that it's rather pricey @ $5 per portion
"crispy on the outside, soft on the inside"
Best coin prata I have ever had. Awesome
Great food amazing in the early morning
Disappointing. Bland curry that felt like it had too much starch in it. Only saving grace is the fluffy kosong. Egg prata was only so so
"Decently priced in a quieter part of Katong, not too crowded on a weekday morning."
The piece Prata was crispy and the curry accompanying it was flavory. Well balanced.
"Average prata, if you live nearby then worth it."
"Prata is good but really long waiting time. Go when u are just go eat for fun. If not, u might end up eating wanton mee or carrot cake."
Amazing prata! Plain prata was crispy but not dry/tough. Arrive early to avoid long waiting times. We reached at 7.30am and had to wait for 10 pax ahead of us. Efficient ordering and queuing system.
"So far, I found Mr and Mrs Mohgan's to be one of the best places serving the crispiest and crunchiest pratas, located around Joo Chiat.

The Egg Pratas were slightly less crispy, catering more to those who prefer their pratas to be more pillowy and soft.

Their Coin Pratas tasted very much like their plains, with a harder and crunchy shell-like exterior, but extremely easy to wallop. You're almost able to pop one into your mouth and finish it in one bite.

Unlike most normie prata places, they serve their fish curry together with a side of their fiery sambal. Mix both curry and sambal and you'll have a dynamic duo guaranteed to let you sweat buckets. It's definitely a must-try for spice-lovers."
"The coin roti is really crispy, the egg of egg roti is evenly done."
Easily a 45 min or longer wait for your prata but it's worth it
Really difficult to elaborate in words how good I find the Mohgans' prata to be. It's just the right amount of oil and crispiness that you want from a prata. Must come early though!
"Coin Prata, Egg Prata, Plain Prata. Thanks to Jill who went to the outlet early at 730am to queue for us, I finally got to try Mr and Mrs Moghan prata.

It was crispy, but the fish curry we had tasted really odd. Some said their dhal curry was worse, while some said they really liked their dhal.

Regardless, another visit to the shop is necessary, and hope I've better luck at getting them the next time I go :)"
best roti prats in sg
"Great pratas that come piping hot and fresh. Plain is definitely more crispy and the main star - the egg variation is inevitably softer but nonetheless equally as savoury.

You get fish curry by default - it's less tangy than I am familiar with and prefer but doesn't disappoint with its sweetness from chunky daikon and gourd pieces. You can ask for mutton curry as well which I highly recommend (gravy is complimentary, with meat it's $4). The gravy tastes similar but the meat is cooked to perfection (see the picture!). Ask for sambal as well to add a new dimension to your meal. It's not as spicy as I like - it's like typical nasi lemak sweet sambal - but it plays well with the muted flavours of the curry gravies.

Other reviews have covered the waiting time. Come early and order, then take a walk around the quaint neighbourhood. The coffee here is great as well!"
Waiting time is long in the morning but the food is worth the wait
Have to wait for more than 90 mins after placing order at 7.10am on Saturday ..prepare to wait ..
"A great place on the east side for amazing prata. The sauces are wonderful, the prata fresh and tasty. Plain is good, but the banana and cheese were good as well. Long wait at 11am so make sure you plan around crowds."
Best pratas around. Great place to chill.
Good and crispy prata but be prepared to wait
Tried the famous prata since i happened to be around this area. Waited at least 20 mins even though the queue was not that long. The plain prata is a little bit too small compare to other shop. Taste wise - yes it is more crispy on the outer but not really stand out a lot compare to other prata shop. Ordered banana cheese prata too. It is nicer and more fluffy compared to the plain prata. Will only patronize again if i am happened to pass by again but definitely not purposely come to have the prata. The shop owner is friendly though despite their shop is famous amongst the foodies.
"Prata is crispy! (See photos of other reviews)
And cheap. $$1 for plain prata.

They allow ordering of single plain prata (most prata stalls minimum order of plain prata are 2pcs). Their curry are GOOD! Ask for fish curry and Sambal Chili  to elevate your prata taste buds experience:D"
"Wow. The best prata in SG East! (maybe even SG). Its done differently from other pratas I've eaten before.
The kosong even without the curry is already very good. I think it has a bit milky flavor to it. The curry is very fragrant but don't douse the kosong in it as the milky flavor will be fine. Just dip lightly to accent the taste.
The egg prata shines too. See picture. It seems eating egg with prata more than prata with egg.
The prata layer is so thin! Shiok.
Note. Wait is long. But good thing is you get a number and wait at your table, while sipping your coffee n playing your phone."
"Parathas are soft and crisp .Worth the wait !
Go with the basic - plain paratha"
Good food. A little bit ex
"We had the plain and egg pratas. Plain pratas were crispy while the same can't be said of the egg prata. Found the pratas rather oily and small. They weren't to my liking as I prefer my pratas more fluffy. I did like the mutton curry and sambal though. Both went well with the pratas.

There was a long queue when we arrived. But they have a pretty good system in place. After you place your order, they'll assign you an order number. You can go back to your seat thereafter and you just need to wait for your number to be called."
"The lady handling the queueing system somehow has favouritism embedded. The numbering system she gave hardly moved but evidently people right behind me who ordered got their orders prioritised.

While I understand it may be feasible to prepare what's closest to the next order but to be skipped for nearly 6 to 8 other patrons who ordered after myself and when asked about why others were getting it first; she merely answered ""hello, cannot read the number ah?""

Also I would highly recommend people avoiding this stall who are just blatantly rude and have no courtesy for their own ordering system. Left without my order and will never return."
Revisit after 3 years.  Probably the best prata in Singapore
"Wednesdays are their closed day. So we went on Thursday....closed!!
That's the problem with stalls that do well...they freaking do what they like!!
Perhaps another lockdown is needed to wake these businesses up...?"
"This is a really hard one but 3 stars for me.
Waited about 20min for 3 pratas, which isn't that long as compared to the waiting time mentioned in other reviews. Pros were that the crispness was just right, and could tell the ingredients were really fresh e.g. dough, ghee and onions. Cons were that the pratas were pretty small, curry was nothing to shout about, and overall this was not really worth the waiting time. Suppose pratas are generally a simple dish thus instinctively it's either good, average or meh. For me, this hovered around slightly above average."
"Nice prata here, however the queue is a little bit long! Price thou is still kept really affordable!"
Real crispy... $1 for plain n $1.50 for egg... cheaper than most of the shops liao. Keep it up... but wait 1 hour for it. Need to eat other food like $2 carrot cake to wait is the best.
The best prata in Singapore hands down. Come down early! Before 12PM. They close at 1PM
Delightful
Tried the kosong and onion prata. It is as crispy as casuarina curry's and just as nice. However it is not worth the 1hr waiting time on Sunday.
To me this is not good Prata. They overdid on the crispiness by deep frying it. This makes Pratas here crispy but hard on the insides. Good Pratas are supposed to be crisp on the outside and fluffy inside.
"Prata was crispy. But be prepared for a long wait, at least 45mins. They offer Sambal along with the prata but the one I had that day was burnt. Mutton curry was better than the fish curry."
Curry isn't very good. Prata is crispy and good. The wait is typically 30mins on the weekends.
"Fluffy, crispy prata which was lovely but waiting time was about 40 minutes (after 11am on a Saturday)."
"Waited for almost 45mins due to Public Holiday the coffee shop was crowded. Ordered take- away.
The pratas were thick and somewhat crispy but not dry. Fish curry was flavourful."
Best prata but the queue is very long
This is the benchmark I use for prata. Long wait though
"One of the best prata around, only if there isn't a queue or long wait. The opening hours here is more accurate than some blogs.

Can wait up to an hour or so even though there are not many customers in front. It is worth a 20 min wait but not longer. You can trust that the prata is extremely fresh."
"Waited for an hour
Friendly Mrs Mohgan"
Came here on a public holiday.  Only plain and egg were available.  Ordered around 10am and only got to eat my prata more than 1 hour later.  Luckily the wait was worthwhile.  Both versions were crispy.   Do let them know you want the fish curry else they serve mutton by default. You can ask for their chilli to add a dash of spiciness to the curry.
"The pratas stand out from all the ones you can find simply because of the homely feel they mirror. The freshness, minimal oil which negates the unwanted grease add to why these pratas are rated the best on the island. Further, unlike other spots, Mr & Mrs Mohgan focus on their curries as much as they do on the pratas. The fish / mutton / dalcha curry compliment the pratas extremely well and this makes all the difference."
"Above average prata, I'd happily eat here again

Plain:  4 stars
Crispy but in a hard crunchy way (more like spring rolls than you zha kueh), and inside is not as supple and chewy as I'd like.

Plaster:  4.5 stars
The egg is yummy."
"Prata is good and nice, crispy if you eat in.. However, as mentioned here, this coffee shop has limited seats and table due to Covid 19. Usually this prata shop has long queue, especially around 8am to 10am. They have variety of prata, like egg, plain, cheese, plaster, coin, etc... But remember one thing, don't order the coffee and tea or teh ci from this coffee shop. Not nice at all..."
Really very normal. Wait 1h plus. The carrot cake beside is very good. Wanton soup is good too.
"Crispy plain prata. Will come again for this. Not so for onion egg prata, cos it was cold when served like it was pre cooked."
The rotis are crispy and tasty. Surprisingly can find such a nice ones in Singapore.
Prepare to wait at least half an hour to an hour for your prata. But totally worth the wait!
"The prata is really quite crispy and the mutton is alright to go with the prata. Do note that the waiting time can be quite a while.
Do come early if you are dining in. As seats and tables are limited."
One of the best in Singapore.
For the 1st timer.. If u are rushing then no need to go there. There is near by parking lot 200m away. Once reach the shop make sure u order 1st then get place to sit. Make sure you order that enough for you since hard to add upon your stomach not full. The fish curry and mutton curry is yummy.. The parata or roti canai damm nice.. Crispy no words can explain.. Should go and try. Make sure you have 1 to 2 hours to get the parata.. I went on 27 Jun 20 Saturday so its busy day. Upon waiting you can have carrot cake beside also.. Not bad the taste. Anyway thanx to Mohgan parata.. Cheers
"Size is perfect. The prata is suitably fluffy on the inside. The curry is perfect. Queuing system is pretty effective. There's a wait but totally worth it.
Given its size 2 kosong suffices especially to those calorie counters. I can't criticize. It's really that good overall."
Nice crispy prata.
Long queue but crispy prata that survived the journey home
"Quite disappointed, not as good as mention."
Tasty and remain crispy while still hot
Don't expect the prata to be crispy if you takeaway. The fish curry was quite tasteless. Maybe they didn't add too much salt in their curry hence it is not as salty as other prata store. But probably it's healthier with less salt.
"Being an eastern resident n a frequent Dunman food centre person. Whenever I passed by this prata shop I will scratch my head seeing the hype n amount of ppl crowding at the Kopi shop for the prata.. given it 2 chances, once eaten alone another w a Fren jus to make sure the hype of it is justifiable. It jus stay an unsolved mystery in my food list. 

Oh ya , n the coffee sucks to the max .."
Very Nice Egg Paratha here. But the common thing is face daily is to wait for long even sometime hour if U r looking to get parcel. Madam is so moody some time U see her smiling and some time don't even try to speak better to remain silent but surely good quality Paratha. Every Wednesday it remains closed.
Light and crispy! Likely the best I ever had. But be prepared to wait...
"Ordered a prata kosong & prata telur. The pratas are definitely freshly made to order. The pratas are crispy on the outer layer & still retains a bit of fluffiness on the inner layers. They serve sambal in addition to curry, which is not commonly found in prata shops in Singapore. The sambal is more on the sweeter side than spicy.

Orders are taken by the lady & she is friendly & soft spoken. She would write down your order on a notepad & give you a queue number. An electronic display board will lit up the number when the food is ready for collection."
Crispy and Fluffy Kosong prata!!
"Excellent roti prata. It takes a bit of time for your food to arrive, but I'd gladly wait an eternity for some more."
Well worth the wait. . .
Well worth the wait. . .
If only we didn't hv to wait for 1 hour!!
Tried a few different pratas. Officially declare Plaster Prata the winner for crispy dough topped with a runny egg! Tip: Come early... like 7am if you don't want to wait too long in line.
"Awesome one. Very crispy and super
super tasty. It's actually a long walk form Paya Lebar MRT, but worth it!"
But please don't come here and ruin it with long queues. Best left untouched. #brownmanreviws
Nothing comes close. Not even my gf.
Great roti! A bit of a wait but worth it. Lovely people.
"Waited 40 minutes for the roti!!! It was good, sure! Chili was wonderful too. But the only ones available when I was there was egg and plain. Wish there's more variety to try considering the waiting time. Nonetheless, it was yummy and I'd love to eat here again."
Best prata place in Singapore
The best prata I've ever had.
Crispy and not too greasy. Curry could be a bit spicier.
Super friendly. Plain prata is very crispy. May need wait for a while on a Friday morning
"Prata as it should be. Slightly sour dough, fluffy and crisp at the same time. The uncle puts his heart into every flip which comes through. A plus and for me well worth the hour long wait."
"I love this place. Cheap, cheerful and delicious. The rotti is crispy and the dips are lovely; the mutton is brilliant. There is also a great tea and beverage stand there too.

Quick edit: The people watching here is fantastic. Especially when the rotti runs out and Mrs Mohgan start waving away the late rotti obsessed."
Great food.
"Prata is super crispy
Curry is vegetable-based and salty"
The coin prata taste really nice..
"Very nice roti prata and reasonably priced with plain roti at $1. Crispy as the name says. Three condiments are L to R; mutton curry with plenty of mutton, fish curry and a spicy gravy. The curries were quite mild to my taste and all three were excellent on the roti."
Excellent prata. Crisp and doesn't taste too doughy. Wait times can be long during mealtimes.
Price has gone up quite a bit since their move from Haig. Go find Geylang east hawker for alternative.
"Tasted good, but have to be patient"
Who doesn't love a traditional prata stall in a coffee shop where the Chef flips prata and does it at his own pace to make sure every prata is done well despite the queue?
"The Mohgans are great value for money but in terms of the pratas, they are decent but not great. Had a murtabak, egg prata and cheese prata. The cheese prata was probably the best. Although I'm hindsight should have just Had the plain prata to appreciate the crispiness. The mutton Curry was good but the fish and dal while spiced well wanted salt. Perhaps I'm being a bit harsh because it's been described as the best in Singapore"
"Claimed to be the best prata in Singapore, and I have high hopes on this restaurant! Very crispy indeed. Very long queue but we managed to get our seats and food. It's fine, as long as the restuarant is popular because of its food, the long wait is worth it."
Best ever prata I ever tasted around Singapore. No joke this kosong prata delivers a aftertaste so good that you'll want more than 1 kosong.
One of the best (if not the best) prata in Singapore. Go early or be prepared to wait.
Very nice light and crispy pratas. However waiting time is very long especially weekends morning.
"The fish curry was flavorful and thick, the prata is almost perfect. And Mr Mohgan managed to get my Roti Bawang Plaster (aka Tampal for is the Malaysians) right, even with a runny egg yolk! 10 points for that. Only improvement that could have been made was the last whack to make the dough inside fluffier. It's a long queue but it's totally worth it!"
"Super nice old school crispy roti prata!

The plain roti prata was extremely crispy and done just right. Great for those who loves crispy roti prata.

The egg prata was just as nice, less crispy, more of soft and fluffy with the egg.

Great place to spend a lazy morning chilling away and enjoying a local breakfast. Store is situated in a coffee shop. On days where the queue is long, one can always order a drink at the coffee shop while waiting!

Store is run by two really nice elderlies and all the pratas are made from scratch. Hence some patience required, but nice stuffs are worth the wait!!"
Its an ok ok prata stall but to wait to get the prata i needed to wait 30 minutes
Best Prata to come to have..... non oily ... Super crispy
First time to try the banana prata. The way the flavor of the banana mixed with the prata and the curry sauce was just superb!! Dining experience was enhanced by the view of the quiet neighborhood. Truly a breakfast experience to remember!
One of the best Prata in singapore. Crispy n nice. Good food comes with long wait.
Great authentic fresh crispy prata. Long waiting time during peak hours. Well worth the visit.
"Delicious, fresh, worthy of another visit."
"Love prata, u may need to wait up to 30 mins"
"being an Indian, I couldn't return From Singapore without trying the roti prata, I searched a lot about the one of the top and famous restaurants from the same, when I came across Mr. and Mrs. Moghan's, I tried the egg prota, it was served with a chicken curry in the side, which was a adding a beautiful taste to the prota. Would definitely recommend."
"It took a looooong time to serve 2 plain pratas, more than 30 minutes.
Pratas are the same wherever in Singapore, nothing special btw."
Classically good. It is as close to the old days roti prata. Unfortunately the curry is lack luster
Nice and reasonably priced prata
Tasty & worth visiting
"If we have to wait because the demand is overwhelming and the food is hard to prepare, that's understandable. But NO, we have to wait because these staffs are too inefficient and artificially inflate the waiting time. The pratas are made by large batches and already started cooling before the orders could be fulfilled. The lady taking orders is rude and too flustered to do anything.
She's spending more time with herself than with the orders. Pathetic. And the food - you can get better pratas easily elsewhere. Don't believe the typical Singaporean hype"
Absolutely loved it! Can't say how good this place makes you feel if you are from a South Asian country. You would start feeling nostalgic & remember all the good times you spent in such small places back home with friends. Mr Mrs Mohgan is that gem which should be visited by everyone traveling to Singapore.
So so not worth the wait at all
The waiting time is terrible. 1.5hr for prata. Prolly 1st and last experience in life.
"Good prata, but long wait times during peak hours"
Kosong prata is crispy and egg prata is soft and good!
"Our go to place for prata fix.. the texture and crisp of the prata is perfect for us.. fish curry dip cpuld do better though.. a basic mom & pop stall... in a nice clean and bright local coffee shop..  Be prepared to wait... if you are not, then go early before 0730hrs..

PS: the carrot cake stall in the same coffee shop is pretty good too!"
"Crispy Prata 
On a busy day the waiting time may be too long. Lack of car park around the shop and public transport is not very convenient to this place."
OK..Nothing much to shout about
Heavenly Delicious.
MUST GET THE CHILLI.
"Prata is not bad but the waiting time is horrible. Taste normal, not chewy enough for me. Prata needs good kopi/tea to enjoy the morning and unfortunately the drink stall offering is really not up to standard fare. The rating is not for the drinks though, it really is for the prata and the wait time. As for the curry, i think the fish curry is better than the other offering."
"Not your average Prata. Crispy outside and chewy inside. While I like it a lot, I just dont think it's worth the wait."
"TLDR: don't bother!! curry bland. overhyped.

prata was decently crispy but on the thick and heavy side, expected it to be more fluffy and light but some people may prefer this style with a little more chew, so i understand.

what i don't understand is how it can be so highly rated when the curry is not good. it's bland, lacks body and basically very very light. maybe it's again a different style of curry and some people like it... but thankfully we did not queue for this (went early on a weekday).

many would still want to try it to believe it.. but just manage your expectations :)"
Good prata
"Excellent. Plain/Egg prata was crispy on the outside, chewy and fluffy on the inside. Mr Mohgan was a busy man making the pratas, producing them with such consistency that comments around the table were that the pratas were deemed good even before it reaches the mouth. Mrs Mohgan was busy taking orders, dishing out pratas and curries with a calm sense of professionalism despite the crowd forming around her every once in awhile. There's a queue number display at the stall, making collection orderly. The curries that accompanied the prata were a choice of fish, mutton and I believe chicken. We personally like the mutton curry while fish curry came in second. I drove about 20 mins for this meal that cost me 3 bucks, would I do it again? Definitely.."
One of the better Roti prata hawker in Singapore. The wait can be very long as the Roti is made to order. Trick is to go after 9am to avoid the pre-work breakfast crowd.
"Top notch prata! Very crisp and also nice and ""unoily"". The curry was smooth and balanced. I  coming back! Went on a Monday morning and had no queue."
Waited for about 30 min on a Thursday late morning. Prata was undoubtedly crisp on the outside and yet fluffy inside. I still prefer Sin Ming Prata for that unmistakable buttery aroma.
Great Prata as ever..
Extremely rude owner.  And the prata was rubbery as well.  Won't ever return.
Prata is good and crispy. The mutton curry is better than the fish curry but a bit bland
"Crispy prata, very oily to the max but nice"
Awesome prata...but opening times are unpredictable
"Super crispy, good dough. The curry were also excellent esp the fish curry and dhal.
The wait seems a bit excessive given I don't think their queue was that long but its really only Mr and Mrs moghan working, so be patient.
Nibble on the decent Chai tow kway next door while you wait."
"No wait on a Tuesday morning, I went up and ordered coin prata and egg/cheese prata. There is also a guy walking around when you sit down asking if you want a coffee, I got a milk tea for $1.20. The coin prata was fresh and delicious, $5 for 6 pieces. The egg/cheese was fresh but not especially to my taste which is fine (personal preference). The fish curry and hot sauce were part of the deal and especially good for dipping when fresh ($7.50) total"
Decent food. Crispy and not so. Ordered an egg and a plain one. Plain not so crispy. Long long wait time. But the aunty is super nice and usually accomodate your demand.
"Roti, especially kosong and bawang was crunchy yums."
Best prata
Get the egg and cheese pratas!
Best prata but gotta get there early or be prepared to wait.
One of the best prata I've eaten. No regrets on waste of calories.
"Should be zero stars. Waited close to 1hr before we gave up. The store has an order numbering system, but it's not followed. Number 87 was on the board for 20 minutes even though orders were being delivered. Eventually the store lady didn't know which numbers to serve anymore making the system useless. Seemed to serve those who complained rather than stick to the order list. Kept taking orders even when many previous orders were waiting. Absolute disaster. Many people gave up just like us. Avoid at all costs."
"Easily the best prata in Singapore. The prata is made to perfection, chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside, and pairs perfectly with the fish curry.

Waiting time is less than 15mins on a casual Monday morning 10am, but expect a long wait on a weekend morning, easily an hour.

The wife is very friendly and motherly too."
Waited 40 minutes and the number queue system only move by 10. Cancelled my order and left. Highly not recommended. Menu is so limited too
Waited 45min for 20 the queue before us for it to only have moved 10.  Gave up. Ha
Crispy n delicious...at $1 a piece....heaven on earth...
Loved the prata. However 20min wait was quite long.
"Prata is crispy and good. But the waiting time is too long and you may not be able to get a seat during the busy hours. Won't recommend making a special trip down for this, but good if you're in the area and it's not overcrowded."
"Prata was normal, curry was bland and non spicy. Nothing impressive, not worth it."
Good food court good prices safe cash.
It is really crispy as its stall name suggests! Worth a visit and you should avoid the peak hours as the waiting time can be well around an hour.
Superb. My mum loved it too 
"Really crispy prata that didn't disappoint despite a long wait of over an hour due to weekends. Ordered plain, egg, cheese and cheese onion. All done very well. I would gladly give it a 5 star had it not been the perfect prata experience to have good Teh terik or other hot drinks to go along. The drink stall in this coffee shop is really way below par. And also curry sauce isnt spicy or tasty enough."
Another great breakfast @ Morgan.  Was given No 4 at 645am.
Service is terrible. The wait for food is more than one hour. When I asked the lady on how long (very politely) she rudely said.. dont know.. don't know.. not sure about the food yet. I am still waiting.
"Got there at 10am on a Saturday, and the wait was about 25-30mins after ordering. Pratas were all super crispy! Love the contrast between the crispy outside and the slightly doughy inside (with the egg and cheese prata I got) We got both dhal and fish curry, and we hands down preferred the fish curry (which is slightly tangy), though our friends from the US liked the dhal curry better."
Great crispy plain prata and awesome prata plaster with gooey yolk :) curry and sambal to accompany your prata is also very yummy! Worth the wait :)
"Expensive, screwed up my order and made us waited longer, smelly oil taste, finger in my curry. Forget the hype, not worth it at all."
nothing special. even the cab driver who took me there said roti canai is basically the same everywhere. now I know that is not true since I've had to die for roti canai in KL but he might be right the SG roti canai is not all that. Of course the roti canai quality is super important but the curry choice is also important and this place just had average fish curry...
Crispy prata. Prepare for long wait though
The best prata makes the wait worth while
Crispy prata that goes so well with the fish curry and added sambal! Satisfaction guaranteed!
Good crispy plain prata at $1 each. Waiting time about 15 mins
"4 star for crisp. Taste wise, room for improvement"
"Wonderful crispy pratas that come with a selection of ingredients. I ordered the plain, cheese and egg pratas and I think the egg and the plain ones were the best. The chicken curry that comes with pratas taste much better than the regular chicken curries at most prata shops. Firstly, it taste fresh (yet simple) and I think they do not include any thickening agents to the curry. Another thing to note is that the pratas are not oily at all and are somewhat light and crispy. Also, the Indian lady that served me was very sweet and friendly towards all her customers. Do check the opening hours before making your way here as the shop closes at 1pm."
"Ordered Plaster , Plain , Egg as well as Mushroom Prata today to try out. Most of them (except the egg which was understandable)  turned out to be really crispy all around with every bite. Curry 's nothing to shout about but the crispiness of the prata is enough for one to make repeated visits to this stall."
Nice prata
"Due to manpower shortage, only 4 types of prata are available - egg, onion, cheese & banana. We had 2 egg & onion and 1 cheese prata with fish and mutton curry for $6

The prata are crispy and nice but not out of the world. The crispy-ness is also not consistent - 1 egg prata is slight soggy. Fish curry is slightly watered down hence mutton curry taste better.

Comfort local food with a decent price point. But unlikely to be back cos my neighbourhood prata taste better..."
"Its alright, the prata is crispy as the name suggests, but i wouldn't wait 45 mins for it."
Great prata and curry
Very crispy and tasty prata. Very long wait.
"The prata here is really soft & crispy!  Fish, mutton curry dips are great, so far this is the 2nd best prata I've tried in a long time . . .But I still haven't found the best as yet "
"Plain prata was very crispy and good!  Other than that, its curry, taste & standard were quite similar to other popular prata shops locally.  The queue took us about 20 min on Sunday."
Best to eat them at the coffee shop. Bought some home and could not regain crisp even with oven toasting.
Very nice. Crispy. Waited for about 10 numbers in front of me. About 20 mins. Came at about 7am. Ample seating and have a cuppa 1st before the main course comes along!!
Crispy prata was ok but the curry was a let down. Egg prata was too soft .
"The prata is really crispy & tasty.
The curry though.. is blehh.."
"Crispy, delicious and not too sweet. Just as good as before when they were along Onan rd. Only difference is that you have to ask Aunty for the sambal chili if you want it."
The wait can be quite long during weekends. But Prata is great. The fish curry is better than the vege/mutton one. But still abit lacking.
"One of the best pratas in Singapore, nice fragrant crispy not oily with tasty curry accompaniment"
World best prata
I wasn't too impressed by this even though the queue can be exceptionally long on weekends. Prata was somewhat crispy only. Gravy was a tad weak and not that flavourful. I'll give this a miss next time.
Prata is fine. But the fish gravy is cold and tasteless. Not worth the queue.
"This prata hit all the right spots, the dough is tasty and has a nice stretch and crisp. Preferred the egg prata over the plain one. Went there early around 7am and while there were people in the queue, the wait was only 5 mins. (On a side note, I would advise to avoid ordering hot drinks from the drink stall, the teh c and milo we ordered were both diluted and disappointing)"
"This place is very popular amongst the locals in Singapore for roti prata. SoeciSpec egg prata and coin pratas. Prices are very low but the waiting could be very long. For almost an hour. Since this place is closer to my house I wanted to give it a try. Honestly speaking I was not disappointed. It was worth the wait. I ordered one egg prata and one egg cheese prata. The egg prata had become soggy and was not crispy so I gave one star less. But the egg cheese prata was super crispy and yummy. I would say order their popular items like murtabak, egg cheese, coin prata etc. as its freshly made and crispy. For a weekend brich better to carry a book for killing your waiting time or you can club it with your grocery shopping from the giant opposite or walk a few minutes to the geylang serai wet market."
"Super raved roti prata by friend , finally have my chance to try it on weekday.(wkend q is by the hours,no joke)To much disappointment the fish curry is tasteless n watery  if u don't fancy curry and eat yours with sugar , then it's fine. Love the crispiness of the prata though"
Good prata and friendly staff
"Best prata in Singapore. If you are an early bird, get there by 6 plus in the morning and avoid the queue."
I travelled all the way from Queenstown but it is not as what it claimed to be. The plain prata is not that crispy and the egg prata is soft on the inside & outside. The curry is not fantastic too. It is slightly above average.
Standard drop after moving to this new place. Mutton tasteless. The sweet chili still good. Prata loses the fragrance. 3.5 stars
Not bad but too pricey for coin prata
Great place for Prata in the morning. Close on Wednesdays.
"Gonna give this shop a 5 /5 stars!
Crispy prata yet it's soft and delicious! It's not easy to get a prata in Singapore that will somehow melts in your mouth.
I feel the Plain prata taste better than the Egg ones probably its crispier.

Tried the Mutton and Fish Curry. Both taste above average. If can improve in the dipping will be even better! But still if you focus just on the prata it's a 5/5 stars no doubt!

Ps. Que system with a number given to you. Therefore you can go to your seat and wait for your number to appear on the screen."
The sambal chilli is the important ingredient to this dish here. But be prepared for a long wait.
One of the best in town. Come early to avoid long queue. It starts at 6.30am
Would give them a higher rating if not for the frequent unscheduled closure.
"Possible the best prata in town. Moved here from Onan Road. We have eaten prata at so many places. This one still beats the rest. Dough is handmade fresh, not factory made. Curry is sooooo nice and fragrant."
Best prata in Singapore. The name doesn't lie - crispy to perfection. Nice blend of slightly sweet and savoury. The sambal is perfect as a compliment. Tried the coin and banana and will be back for more. Do note they can close 11/12 so get there early.
Yummy. Probably best prata in the neighbourhood
The perfect prata fix!
Tasty and crispy prata. So glad to have found them after they relocated. Will be back for more.
My favorite roti as always ...
"One of the best prata in town.  Same good taste after shifting frm Crane Rd.  The new location is more spacious for seatings n more parking slots nearby.  Better be early especially during wkends,  their pratas sold out fast."
"My favourite Prata restaurant in Singapore. While food is great, make sure you go with lots of time as average wait is somewhere around 40-50 minutes. Nice spot to hang out on a Sunday morning and watch the world go by :-)"
"Probably the best pratas in Singapore. Very desires, mostly long queues, but it worth it!
Vermutlich die besten Pratas in Singapore. Sehr begehrt, meist lange Warteschlangen,aber es lohnt sich!"
Get there early and be prepared to wait quite a while for your Rotis. But very good!
"Located in a rustic part of city with classic buildings and night crawlers hangouts our early morning 0730 visit to this Mr & Mrs Mohgan's Crispy Prata was a pleasant experience. Tables at the kopi tiam in which the Stall is located already begining to fill steadily and by 0800 all the tables taken and table sharing has begun.

Our food order was 10 away from that displayed (last served) and our wait was less than 15 mins ( guess time also depending size of each order # ahead of us). Tried their Coin Prata, Egg & Onion as well as Plain. Verdict? Jolly Crispy that was kinda delightful to chew and when bathed with the curry provided, it was confirmation why folks come from far corners of the island to queue and savour this Prata stall.  We will return."
Best prata in SG. Long wait though. Mutton curry worth trying too.
"Great place to kickstart your day! Prata with omlette (egg) fusion with generous amount of cheese accompanied by tasty sambar is my favorite.
Coin prata is a great dish to share.
Beware of the wait time, but it's definitely worth it!
The key is to order your pratas, take a quick stroll along the heritage buildings, get your instagram-worthy shots and be back for prata delight!"
"I like it, crispy prata and its not charred! is not too oily as well. wait time about 10-15mins, there is a organise number queue system. carpark is hard to find generally speaking. everyone seems like is here for the prata. the rest of the store seems like only operate at night."
Crispy prata
Crispy and good. But expected to wait for 1 hour on a weekend.
"Went on a weekday early morning 8am, there are 3 orders in front of us. One of the best prata in Singapore, their prata are superb, feel like I am at their home having this 'homemade' prata. The crispiness is just right, they do not 'mass produce' their plain prata, every pcs of prata is made upon ordering, they are not oily. The curry is very slightly diluted which I think this is good, unlike those curry out there have strong pungent smell or taste. Can feel that Mr n Mrs Mohgan are pleasant ppl which probably attract a large pool of regular customer."
"One of the best prata in Singapore, recommended for tourist but have to wait for quite some time. Worth the wait"
Heard a lot about this prata stall and decided to give it a try after it had shifted to joo chiat..It definitely did not disappoint..The prata was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside..Will surely go back again for more!Be prepared for long waiting time if you go during peak hours..The other stalls in the coffee shop are very good as well! The carrot cake is not bad too..Did not get to try the wanton mee this round but will be back next time.
Exact location is junction of Crane road and Oman road ( Poh Ho Restaurant)
Was not open today. Will be closed till wednesday
"came all the way here for three different days, but never ever open????? that's how good it is....wonder when will be the next show time?
22,oct.2018, wife suggestwe try again, maybe this time the stall open....good enough, they did with a long Q with number system. waited for a reasonable amount of time, and our are ready. no daubt about it, the pranta and curry are good .
coffee shop that serve the milk tea are really no can do. really lousy.."
Prata was indeed super crispy however we waited an hour for this!!!!! Not worth the wait.
"Not worth queuing ...Prata isn't as crispy as before at their new location (300 joo Chiat road). The prata is so cha when they rush to make it. Curry is too watery. Mr Mohgan is not making the prata like before, something seems to be bothering him these days."
"Popped by Mr & Mrs Mohgan's new spot in Tin Yeang Restaurant coffeeshop along Joo Chiat Road, and we only waited 15 minutes for our order (Sunday, 11am)!

We ordered a spread of plain, egg, mushroom & cheese, and egg, onion & mushroom pratas - I still like the plain prata most with the fish curry and a dab of sambal. Make a pit stop before it gets crowded again!"
one of the best prata places in SG. the waiting time is really long. had to wait 1.5 hours for our pratas to be ready. food is very very good must I say.
"I'll just add to the list of prata photos then shall I?
Food is fresh and tasty, worth eating. They make it really well. I tried the egg roti prata and I enjoyed it. I think the wait is quite long as it was about 15+ wait in the morning. But a good way to enjoy a drink in the morning and relax while you wait."
Quite a lay back location around Joo Chiat area. Parking can be a problem. Prepare to walk and remember to place a parking coupon as warden comes unexpectedly. Prepare to wait for table and prata on a good day. Ask for fish curry which is more appetizing. Coffee and tea at the coffee shop are just ordinary. If only they are good to go along with the prata.
Best parata I have ever had
Nice prata
"3 Stars only
I consider myself something of a Roti aficionados and I will say they did look fabulous. Everything about them suggested our 30 minute trip to try them would be worth it.

Until I got to the front of the line...'finished - no more...' it was 1045!!

So, clearly my advise is get there early.

(Fortunately the Geylang Serai Market is not far away and we managed to find nice alternatives there.)

Update to 5 Stars
Update: Went back several days later.  Worth the wait - they were the best Roti I've ever had!!"
"This place is like a step back in time. Pratas were ordered from the stall and they will shout your number when orders are ready.

Prata prices are cheap and whilst we ordered both egg and plain pratas, the plain pratas were the standouts. Curry had two types, mutton and fish, both were ok. They also have sugar available if that's how you like to eat yours."
Usually crispy but not so last week. Mrs Mohgan is a delightful lady - so cherry and pleasant all the time.
"SALTY SOGGY PRATA AFTER 1HR WAIT

Every Sunday morning I would drive out to any highly recommended haunts throughout the island and anticipate a great discovery. I was so excited when I was given a queue number of 61 when the current number was 41! Busy means good right?! 1 hour later I collected my food and I knew I made a mistake. I ordered 4 plain and 2 eggs and ended up eating only 1 each. The curry lamb i ordered was extremely salty and the pratas though freshly fried were soggy and salty. I have eaten many many times better."
Only open in the morning from 6 to 1130am ish. I arrived at 730 and by 8 there was a massive line.
Very good local fare but experience marred by a long wait time.  Be prepared for prata to be sold out by 9.30am
One of the genuinely better prata places around
"Awesome place for prata. Got the mushroom with cheese and mushroom with egg prata with mutton curry was sublime and all for less than $7! They also have a couple of mixed veg and noodle stalls next door, great way to start the day exploring East Coast. Can get busy and full but the turnover on tables is quick enough"
"Great prata, lovely quiet corner but really long wait"
Serving awesome prata! Must prepare to wait but worth it!
Cheap and best and as in the name so in the pratha loads of crispiness. Tucked in a corner of crane road with a hand-written name plate as a part of a small eating joint for first time visitors don't be surprised by the small corner stall selling hot prathas's. Very economical and make sure you order your lot in one shot ( don't just order one for each) and be ready for 30-45 mins wait time on weekends
"Nice crispy prata, superd service by Mrs Mohgan! Love it here."
40 minutes wait. Cramped up coffee shop. Prata at a $1 but I don't see whats the hype about it.
"Waiting time on a weekend morning was about 45 minutes. Plain and egg pratas are not that freshly made, there's a ready stack at the side. However, when other pratas are in your order, the plain and egg ones aren't served until your queue number is reached.

Prata was very salty, which was not to our liking. Sauces are good but the salty prata was overpowering.

Perhaps this was an anomaly since there are so many positive reviews. Might try again, but definitely not waiting 45 minutes for this again."
"Whenever I feel like eating roti prata, will think of them. Long queue, be prepared to wait."
Super crispy prata that's worth the long wait! The plain prata is the best in my opinion and it goes really well with their savoury curry 
Very crispy prata as it's name suggests. Come early as they tend to sell out around 11am and be prepared to wait for your food.
The olden days coffee shop setting elevates the atmosphere as you tear the soft and chewy prata before dipping it into the delicious sambal and curry!
Decent prata. Wait time is too long
Very delicious prata. Best I've had in Singapore so far. Highly recommended and cooked perfectly. Only downside is location as not easy to get to by public transit in my opinion.
"best prata in the neighbourhood
But be prepared to wait"
Roti here is delicious and great value
Please be aware that the English name is not written anywhere on the facility. The Prata was freshly made (you can watch them). But it seems you cannot choose your gravy. They just give you one. A bit rude to foreigners but within normal Singapore levels. The drinks guy also serves some baos. Two Prata for $3 and a coffee plus bao for $2.
Excellent roti made by a lovely couple. There's usually a queue but it moves along at a decent pace. Definitely worth the wait.
"Definitely a recommended place to get a Roti Prata. There's quite a queue, but still not a long wait. Plenty of choice for the topping as well, including chili dipping instead of curry. Recommended to come a bit earlier in the morning since they might sold out after 10 AM"
Definitely the best roti prata in Singapore. Much less oily compared to other crispy prata.
"Finally tried this.  Old school mom and pop hawker stall in an old school kopitiam.  Expect queues but the wait is not excessive.

The prata is tasty and crispy, especially the kosong which has a pleasant chewy texture.  Would have given it 5 stars if the curries were a little more robust.

Worth a try if you're in the neighbourhood!"
Amazing! The roti really is super crispy! You even get to watch the roti being made. First place your order then take a set and pay upon collection of order. Each roti is served with a small bowl of curry which had a great flavour not very spicy. You can also take advantage of the other three stalls serving drinks and Singaporean dishes.
"Excellent crispy prata, well worth the wait (and the heat)"
great prata
One of the best crispy roti prata in Singapore. Be prepared for a wait (45min) on weekends though! Ask for sambal to go along with the prata!!
Visited again. Just as good as before.
Old school crispy prata!
awesome food.. love the prata!
Mrs Mohgan is very friendly despite a busy day. Prata is crispy however rather thick. Personal pref... Think prata. Curry is nice. Might go back to try others.
"The Curry so,so only lah! Prata is not bad though..."
"Egg prata is excellent, although it could be less oily. Serving size is a tad small, so order up -- you'll want to especially because the wait is 45 minutes on Sunday at 9.30am."
"Good prata, just that if you go on a fuming hot day its gonna burn...."
"Olden times coffeeshop with super friendly staff, prata was a bit too oily but very crispy. Both mutton n fish curry were just right, not too salty."
Best best best prata in the east
Crowded. take a number n wait long long. But friendly service. Will come again. Crispy prata w nice gravy  #CrispyRendang
"Excellent freshly made pratas but the wait is getting too long on weekends. Crispy on the edges and fluffy inside, a must to have it with curry and sambal. I love their mutton curry with bone & marrow."
"The prata is crazy good. Aunty and uncle are always super busy but still maintaining their motto ""keep calm and curry on"""
Delicious and super crispy roti prata
"Sorry to say, it tasted like frozen prata although it's made to order, and they were burnt after almost an hour wait "
Prata is good but sells out early. Be sure to be there in the morning!
Excellent Indian fare esp their prata roti. Soft and crispy. Delicious spicy curry too. Clean and friendly
"Been here a couple of times. I love the handmade prata ,made fresh here"
"Waited forever for the food. At least it was fresh, but nothing out of this world"
Really awesome prata! Be prepared to wait up to 1.5hrs on weekend mornings.. but your stomach will thank you for it ;)
"When arrived there at 11:00am, Pratas just sold out. Wasted trip."
"Maybe the food is good if they serve you, but they discriminate (at least against expats). They served the person in front of me then told me they were sold out, while I watched them cook more prata in front of me. As I rode away in my taxi I saw them serving more people in line."
"This is a must eat in Singapore. There is a queue to order and they call your number when you can pick up. Worth trying a couple options, we had the plain, onion, egg, and the mutton murtabak. They open at 6:30am so is a great option when you are still jet lagged. The coffee and tea at the other stall in this ""restaurant"" is good as well."
"My son, an avid prata eater, says this ia the best prata in singapore! Will come back again!"
"One of the most crispy and well made prata to be found. Location is not too easy to find but it is well worth it. Curry is not diluted like other stalls that can be found out there. Be warned that there is a queue to have the popular prata. Those that come with a car, would have a field day looking for lots to park nearby."
So small... But delicious. Easily eat 4 plain ones and still not full. No waiting at all late morning on a weekday. Just make bigger ones please.
Nice prata...
Old school crispy prata
"Crisy prata with curry and sambal chilli , Great"
"Good prata!! Crispy, not overly thick yet non oily! Above average curry sauce and 'sambal' sauce"
"I do like the style of prata they served (the soft and chewy and not the crispy type) and the difference in the dough but the effort taken to go there that early versus the satisfaction of the food we had, it was a meh.

Good. Not that great of prata and curries.

Why the hype?"
More crispy than other stalls. Good.
Waited for 20mins or so (on a Sat morning) but it was worth it! Really fluffy prata and yummy dhal. And mrs Mohgan is so cute :>
Best Prata in the East. Come before 8 on weekends or prepare to wait. I'd give the Neighbour food stalls a miss.
Prata has great texture and tastes delicious:) loved the mutton murtabak!
Excellent prata but be prepared to wait.
GOOD PRATA
Great tasting prata
"Crispyyyyyy!!! But sadly, no aircon"
"The three stars is not a reflection on this place 's food. It is just that though I asked for directions to this place, I was never able to go there. From what I heard, this is one of the best places to have Roti Canai. Theirs is said to be very tasty and there are very long lines in front of this place."
Go eat there. Do it. And get the mutton curry or a side of sugar if you need a little sweetness in your life. You won't regret it!
Superb Roti Prata......yummy
Excellent prata
It was ok.. Bland sauces. No vegetarian sauce either so you can just have the roti. Very long wait that wasn't honestly worth it.
Roti prata is crispy but the mutton curry cannot make it taste abit sweet and diluted the sambal not spicy also have little sweetness in it. Wasted the prata. Overrated dun worth queing if the q is super long .
"Everything we had was really good, but the banana roti was super delicious!"
"Great prata ... waiting time on weekends can be very long :) there was even a queue at 9am on a Monday morning.
The fried beehoon staff beside is good too. Al dente and not too oily. Chicken wings and fillets are delicious"
"One of my favorite stops while in Singapore. Prepare to wait a bit for the roti, order a coffee or milk tea while you partake the people watching and the two other businesses that serve food. For roti, order first and get a number, then she will call you (by number), then pay. Crunchy and airy but not oily IMO. I enjoyed it very much, as a snack."
"Heard so much about this place and finally decided to check it out. Tried the plain o' prata and egg prata -- the best litmus test for pratas. While queueing I saw the pratas being cooked were really charred, so I requested for them to be fried lightly instead.  They were tasty, but nothing out of the ordinary to warrant a trip here just for this. Curry served was chicken and mutton curry - very average too."
"Can't believe I only know of this place now... I've been missing out! Previously I will settle my cravings at Sin Ming, Serangoon North, or Casuarina, but I'm glad I have another option now. The wait around 11am was crazy tho. I waited exactly 40 mins for my order from the then order 28 to my order 42."
"This prata shop operates out of a traditional coffee shop, nestled in a low-rise neighbourhood. Crowd builds up rapidly in the morning and there may be a considerable wait during peak hour.

Curry is thick and delicious. Pratas are well made. Had the egg prata with onion. Fluffy texture. The kosong (plain) prata has a flaky texture like a croissant."
Best prata in Singapore by far. Crispy yet fluffy.
One of the best roti prata stores in Singapore. Must try the mutton curry too. The stall is inside an old kopitiam so it invokes a nostalgic feeling while eating prata too.
Love it! Certainly lives up to its name. If you're health conscious please do yourself a favour and look for something else.
Prata kosong was thick and crispy. Auntie was a joy to chat with
"Ladies & Gentlemen, best prata & murtabak in Singapore. You are welcome.

Must order: Mutton curry"
for the crispy prata in a quaint coffee shop. The plain prata goes fantastically well with the mutton curry. Be prepared to wait for 30mins or longer especially during the weekends. Go before 10am cos It runs out fast...
Crispy roti prata offered in a 80's setting coffee shop ... go early esp on weekends as it is crowded with people.
their prata is good! crispy! and the gravy is yummy too!
Delicious crispy prata with tasty curry to go with it
Nice prata
Really awesome crispy pratas
Very delicious fried prata. Jus be prepared to wait 20-30mins for the yummy food.
One of the best roti pratas you can ever find in Singapore. Best to come early.
"Crispy Prata, extremely popular be prepared for 20-30 min wait"
"Long wait on weekends, but yummy pratas!"
"Old school! If you want crispy plain prata, this is the place. They do some prata varieties here but I wanted the basics so ordered a plain prata and an egg prata. Both good! Tourists should come here for a real Singapore corner coffee shop experience. Other nice food like wantan noodles here. They also provide a rare condiment nowadays: sambal ikan bilis. So good with the prata"
Closed on a monday
Great food for eating. Don't watch calories!!
"Texture wise it was awesome. Taste wise left something to be desired... it felt like they were going for low salt in everything. Matter of preference for the individual.

Price for quality can't be beat.... we went really early though and it was still quite the wait. Don't regret trying it... but will probably get my prata fix elsewhere all things considered."
Crispy and fluffy prata ever eaten :)
Crispy and chewy at the same time. Gravy is power. Cheap and so be prepared to wait.
Excellent roti prata
"Trybthe mushroon,cheese, onion and egg prata"
"Went on a Sunday morning around 1020, food finally arrived around 1145.  The wait is too long.  The roti is too oily but curry was good. Taste is average and not worth the long wait."
Don't miss out on trying an original and authentic crispy roti prata
"waiting time is about an hour at 1000H on a Sunday... however the Prata is crispy on the out side, fluffy on the inside"
Friendly and the pratas taste so good!
Go for this if you like crispy prata. Tried the curry fish which is quite diluted.
If you like chewy fluffy Prata this would be your thing
Fresh hot crispy tasty roti prata. Gravy need to be more tasty!
I must say the wait is worthwhile as the prata is crispy if eaten on the spot. The curry choices are great as well. Just be sure to eat it in the old style coffee shop to really enjoy the prata.
"As usual, awesome food..the shop owner shld at least provide some comfort by installing fans outside. Just wishful thinking."
Awesome old school fluffy prata. 
It is one of the best coin Prata in the east side of singapore near Joo Chiat. Must try. Please note they operate until 1pm only.
"Good food
Friendly madam"
Crispy Prata! What else?!
Super awesome prata.
"Very crispy prata, the daal curry is great!"
corner coffee shop. can be crowded during meal times. famous prata. wanton mee and economic beehoon/rice also available. has a Muslim stall too.
Mr and Mrs Mohgan are the experts in making awesome plain and crispy prata!
"Ordered a plain and egg prata, loved the plain one more as its crispier. Really good curries as well. Go for the dhal curry if u don't eat spicy!"
Delicious and traditionally made prata
"The best Prata in town. Totally worth the wait. Crispy and flaky on the outside, soft and chewy in the inside. The combination of the cheese and onion prata is highly recommended."
Nice prata but as usual must wait.
Crispy. Curry not too hot.
"Forget Jalan Kayu. Mr and Mrs Mohgan's probably serves the best roti prata in Singapore. The texture of the croissant-like pancakes is fluffy and crispy. I have been their patron for years and never had I got a burnt or overcooked roti prata once. Unlike some of the other prata places I have tried. Their pratas are always hot. Their curry is just nice. Not too spicy with the right consistency (not too thick or watery). If you go on weekends or public holidays, expect to wait at least 15-20 minutes. It is a family business with both husband and wife (sometimes their son will help) working hard to please their most demanding customers. Do cut them some slacks and be patient. Tables and seats are limited, so table sharing is expected. The place is a bit inaccessible if take public transport. The kopitiam where the stall is situated in the middle of a housing estate. This is why I give 4-stars instead of 5."
Best prata in Singapore and that is saying a lot! My go to spot each weekend morning and the Koppi sold in same hawker area is very nice as well.
"Arguably one of if not the best prata I've tried in Singapore. The curry is fragrant but not too spicy. It has mellow taste and light feel to it. The prata on the other hand is one of the best I've had in my life, the dough is fluffy and chewy, while slightly charred and crispy at the outside. The smoky smell is just mouthwatering and is a great addition to the texture and the taste of the prata. Would definitely come back for more."
Amazing Prata! Eat while hot! Affordable prices 2 of us shared 1 egg 1 cheese n 2 plain.. cost about $5
"Perhaps the best prata around - nice balance of crispiness and bite. There is usually quite a wait and parking can be an issue, though all of that is worth it for me. One less star because of the occasional, though disturbingly so, dirty cutlery with dried up curry."
"Rustic but gold, simple and very reasonably priced."
"Best prata in Singapore, but make sure to bring some time, or come towards the end of service (around 12.30pm)"
Crispy prata. Friendly auntie
"One of the best well-kept secrets in the area. Extremely crispy prata that's perfect for breakfast and lunch. The dough is tasty and the portions are good. My only gripe was that my murtabak was stuffed with too much chicken, although that shouldn't really be a complaint. The queue on weekend mornings is crazy but if you're brave you'll be rewarded with some really good prata."
They kneed their owe prata dough. Then they cook your prata to order. A longer wait but worth the wait
Really crispy and inexpensive prata! Wait is a bit long but worth it!
"One of the top Prata in Singapore. The only downside is too oily, but that's what make it crispy I guess..."
"Great prata! The best so far I've ever had and the service is not to be frowned upon.  A long wait at peak hour, but it's worth it!"
"It has clearly many layer like croissant but too oily, not fresh enough..
Slow service. It's been 1 hour waiting for these 3 prata."
Good and crispy roti prata.
Great prata
Fluffy yet crispy prata - be prepared for a slight wait but worth it for the original!
Best Prata
closed on wednesdays
Simply good food
Very crispy prata.
Crispy fluffy prata!
Simple yet excellent crispy prata in the East. Opens early morning.
One of the best Prata around
Great prata!
Good prata. Long wait.
Nice crispy prata!
One of the best roti prata in Singapore
Awesome old school crispy prata.  I went here a couple of times last year and could eat it every day.
Best Roti Prata in singapore.
"I have never had crispy prata before.
It was very nice.

The best one for me was egg + cheese prata.

you can add egg, mushroom, onion, and cheese to your prata."
One of the best crispy pratas I've had. The staff was also very friendly despite the long queues.
Excellent parathas.
The prata were delicious and will come back again
"My favourite prata place in the Katong neighbourhood. The plain prata is crispy and soft, always freshly made. However this place has become very popular lately, after many food bloggers' recommendations and reviews. Now it's a long wait during weekends."
"Prata had a long queue, when I had a chnace to eat it. Theres nothing special."
"Didn't make me go ""wow"" but it was good prata all the same! Worth trying, but probably not worth waiting for 30 mins for it so go early."
You can't find any better prata else where.
"The Pratas are really nice. You see them come to life right in front of your eyes. You get one piece of prata for every order so make sure you order enough. The method to take the orders is literally scribbling on a pad next to the oil pan. The curries with the Pratas are what makes the difference. You have a choice of Dalcha, fish and mutton curry. All amazing. This place is not for a quick Sunday breakfast bit rather a lazy Sunday brunch. Typically would take you 15 mins to order in queue and 20 mins for the order to be delivered. Overall lovely Pratas but the wait is the killer."
"Great crispy traditional prata that's fluffy and nice, but not worth the wait of 45 minutes on a Sunday morning. The lady who serves mixes up the orders and doesn't know whose is whose when there's too many people in the list."
Sold out by 11:15AM on Saturday. Come early.
"Since I had Roti for the first time I have been looking all-round for other Roti places. So I decided to go to this place after my return to Singapore! It is a quite small place, not touristic at all!! The staff is really friendly and the food is served fastly! It tastes really good and is really cheap! I can really recommend this place!!"
"The best prata ever. Crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside."
Best crispy prata ever.  Closes randomly.
Crispy and tasty prata which is fresh off the griddle. Be prepared for a long wait
Crispy delicious prata
"Unfortunately, I did not find their prata super crispy as the name suggests."
Prata very crispy and ikan bilis sambal nicely done
Local classic for prata
Just normal crispy prata taste so so
Super crispy for the prata.
"prata is very crispy (read: oily), but the sardine sambal is fantastic and goes really well with the prata"
Too sublime. Prepare to wait.
"One of the more chewy prata around.  While most prata focus on just being crispy, this focus on the proper stretching and layering of the dough to give it the chewiness on top of being crispy."
"Wait is quite alright, tad bit overrated but, it's cheap and they make it differently and with heart."
Nice delicious crispy prata
Had the cheese and kosong (plain) and they were seriously crispy on the outside and chewy delicious inside. The curry could be thicker as it was a little watery but the sambal chili gave it that spicy kick.
"Tried 1 egg and 1 plain prata with the mutton curry on a weekday morni h. Other than the prata being somewhat crispy(due to the amount of oil being used to fry them), flavour wise seemed pretty ordinary. Mutton curry was pretty normal too. Overall nothing to shout about."
"For sure one of the best, if not the best, pratas in Singapore. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, the pratas are so tasty you can even eat them on their own without curry. Hand made fresh daily from their special dough."
Best prata in Singapore . But they have limited seating  and it's hot here.
True to description crispy pratas :)
"Bit of a wait as it's pretty damn busy. But it's delicious! Worth the stroll, worth the wait.
Don't expect fine dining conditions. It's as basic as it gets.
Super cheap, tastes amazing!"
"I loved both the plain roti prata ($0.90) with sugar, as well as the egg roti prata ($1.40) with mutton curry ($3).

The addition of the egg actually results in a pretty different texture, much softer and less crisp, both great in their own way."
Delicious prata and nice people. Will definitely come back
"1st time. Had 2 plain and 1 egg share with wife and 3 yr old.  Plain prata crispy. Very nice. Egg prata so so.  The curry is average and a bit too watery.  No real queue to order so you have to ask but they keep track of the orders so there is no hijacking. Waited about 15 mins.  Ate a bowl of wanton form neighbouring stall at $2.50 while waiting.

Will try again though."
"Normally, I will go very early for breakfast and he will make fresh ones for me when I was staying at Koon Seng Rd.  Since I 've shifted out hardly make my way there.   Really missed the prata.  Must make a trip there again."
"Terrible, ordered from the grab app, 3 pcs of fishcake, received fish fillet instead."
"Feel like a scam, the price that they listed is not what they are charging!! I used their listed price and I calculated my rojak cost, it is ABT a dollar more. When I questioned them, they claimed those are old prices and their printer does not have time to update their pricing. What cock and bulls story"
"Extremely rude staff, bad quality food and threatening staff."
"this place takes forever, got 3 people inside the kitchen all doing absoluty doing nothing. i only order 3 cheese prata but takes almost 20 minutes?? how is that possible???"
In this restaurant tasty and service is good and so many varieties of the options available in food
Tried Nasi goreng very tasty and yummy 
"Ordered mutton nasi goreng, paid for it but got plain nasi goreng without any meat. Disappointing."
"The worst indian rojak ever. Do not buy from this stall. The rojak gravy is so runny.The mee goreng also tastes below standard. When asked about the menu, the seller is also very rude to customers. Will never buy from this stall again. The worst Indian rojak stall ever."
Tried Mee goreng and Maggi goreng taste was so yummy and the price was reasonable
I ve bought the ikan bilis fried rice twice. And its not fresh.
Greetings. I ordered via grab food . 2 dishes. Mee goreng and a mutton soup instead I receive mee goreng and mutton terrible chop. Talked to the staff or owner of the stall over the phone. Even he is terrible. No sense of responsibility. Was rude.
"Tried the Indian Rojak. That was the worse we ever tasted. Sauce no taste and runny, everything is just fried with 1 thin slice of cucumber cut into 4. Never again"
A good place to get your Indian Rojak and Goreng dishes. I ordered the Mutton Steak combo beehoon. Taste is nice and a hint of spiciness. Love the cucumber with the ketchup. Their mutton steak is cooked well and meat is not hard.
"delicious food order, specially Indian Rojak and mee goreng must try one."
Chicken chop & mutton chop in this quality? Try it if your dare! Poor standard! Never try this!
"Ordered a chicken chop. The taste is ok but the portion is patheticly small. Not worth the the $5.5 , just like snack and don't fell like u just had a main dish at all. "
"Food is dilicious, tulang merah is recommended and good service too."
"Really good, here's something eals you could say instead of delicious.......yummy, flavorful..."
Super yummy food specially Mee goreng and indian rojak and good service...
Potato in the mee georang was spoilt. And they don't wear their mask properly and attitude is bad.
Good service thanks!
"Worse place to eat!!.Firstly i ordered white mee hoon goreng.I was given a spicy mee hoon goreng. The person who served me claimed i ordered for e spicy one.Never mind i proceeded eat the food they gave me.When i was eating mee hoon goreng, it was too plain with some veg n bits of fried egg.I was questioned how come it was too plain.He claimed that i must tell him then he will put in the mutton or ikan bilis.Really disappointing!!!Normally i order mee hoon goreng spicy , it comes with mutton.At least he could hav asked me
."
"Food is delicious, dinner crowd can get long but it is definitely worth the wait! Nasi goreng pattaya is recommended, as well as the rest of what they offer as well."
"with the wide range on their menu, to go along with their Indian rojak .. we did not have high expectations. but was pleasantly surprised by how good the taste quality really was. but the quantity for the dishes on menu though, could do with a little more i reckon."
Had early dinner today Brought the chicken cutlet with lemon sauce. Taste is so so. Only think i like is that it cost only $4.
"Chicken horfun is mediocre at best. Honestly, it tastes so typical that there's nothing much to comment."
"Not knowing what to eat. Accidentally I saw Laksa chicken noodle on their menu. Sounds great. So, I ordered Laksa ""roast chicken"" bee hoon. It was nice. The laksa was thick and creamy. The taste opened my appetite. Yummy."
"Wo Shi seletar mall De Chang Ke,Mei Ci Du Mai Ban Zhi Yi Shang Lai Chi,Mu Qian Jue De Fu Wu Shui Ping Yue Lai Yue Chai,Dui Bi Yi Qian,Xian Zai Ji Gu Tou Xie Hong Huan Zai Dao Jiu Na Chu Lai Mai,Yi Qian De Tou Shou Hui""Qu Gu"",Zuo Tian Mai De Mei Qu Gu,Rou Zhi Chai Yi Wai,Huan Qie De Te Da Kuai,Chi De Zhen Bu Shuang.

No chilli for half portion chicken? I hope your stall survives.
I ate this in Kallang Wave actually. This is an ok for me.
"Chicken rice somehow standard dropping .. I ask for chicken back meat, but still get breast meat."
"Prices went up for their food across the board. Usually, I go for their steam or roasted chicken rice with extra meat. Which is $5. Sometimes they dont give cucumber. This time ordered the chicken cutlet, portion of chicken was disappointing for $4, probably enough for a primary school student. I Understand, margins are razor thin but the portion doesnt justify the price. Taste wise the food is so-so."
Female staff at the counter is rude
"We order Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang with a whole chicken thigh together with the drumstick but gave me piece of chicken patties some vege & a fried egg, it's a scam."
"Decent portion for its price.
The uncle may or may not be cheap, but he did not skate. So not a cheap skate.

Don't ask for extra chilli if you can't handle it, I couldn't handle it"
Typical Chicken Rice stall serving good chicken Rice mainly roasted chicken. Also serving noodles with chicken and chicken char siew. Reasonable price and it is Halal.
"Terrible service from the Chinese man managing the stall. Rude attitude, needs to pay attention to his tone and mannerism when serving customers. Food is otherwise quite alright. Makes me think twice about buying when I see him again."
"I have been a regular with this stall for 5 years. My experience was good but today I was served by the boss. He's loud and rude. I did ask for 1 packet of chicken rice chilli (the tiny packet) though I've  ordered chicken noodle which I think will just cost him 3 cents the most. He replied to me loudly ""cannot""
Goodbye uncle you have lost 1 regular just for the sake of 3 cents chilli..Will never buy there again."
"Very bad service from the staff at kapnung chicken rice store nothing is free in this singapore.
Ask for extra chilli cannot ask for extra soup cannot. The staff so unfriendly, and always ask to call the boss if not happy.Terrible service."
"The chicken rice was good but their service is bad, very rude,ask extra chily the guy give me black face everything I buy,still if still like that I won't  come back to buy"
One of the worst place to buy chicken rice. Ask for more chicken char siew sauce the don't even give. I ask again why the staff say thet won't give. So eating rice without char siew sauce. Today I buy again ask for sauce not say more sauce just ask for sauce not even a drop of sauce I get.  Pease do not ever buy from this shop. There are many bad reviews not only here but on other platforms. No stars for his this stall
Very rude and disrespectful staff....
the portion? cheapskate sellers. very dissapointing.
the portion is so cheapskate! if i could attach photo i would! i bought the chicken rice for ur info
"Not too sure what's with the other reviews below on their service. Staff has always been friendly and even offered more soup when he saw that I finished mine. Honestly one of my favourite chicken rice stalls and is decently priced. Rice is fragrant, chilli is ""garlicy"" and tasty, chicken is great. 10/10"
"Chicken rice is tasty. Portion was alright, just nice. Service was good and fast."
Portion not worth the price.
"Every time ordered via Foodpanda, there is always some items missing. Wake up your idea!!"
"The portion given is miserable, the promotion for NTUC member is cheating,  they give super small portion. Staff unfriendly and unhappy when we want to claim the offer. If this offer is not profitable just remove it and not to show customers the attitude."
Nice and sedap Nasi Ayam.
"My experience visiting My Kampung Chicken rice was not a pleasant one. The chicken rice itself was nice and tasty but the service behind the bar was not friendly at all especially the young Chinese guy who was preparing the chicken. He was unfriendly, unaccommodating and quite rude. The other, a Malay lady was pleasant. It was Friday evening and surprisingly it was not busy hence I didn't understand the attitude. I hope My Kampung Chicken managent can see my honest review because even though your chicken rice was good but when your service lacks, its difficult for us to come back as a paying customer. Please attend to this immediately. Thank you."
super expensive for a NTUC social enterprise. 1 common pc of fried fish $4(the cross section of fish fried that kind) and veg with just couple of pieces of meat is considered meat dish price. can't help but feel scammed. end up just 3 items cost almost $7 without any special items. i compare these prices vs other cai fan in woodlands(excl food court) and this stall has got to be one of the most exp.
Gold standard for chicken rice
Have always patronised this stall. Its duck is oily but legendary. Don't be deceived by the roast chicken. One of the most succulent I ever had. They don't make very good chicken rice though (you fan). And on a sunday I visited the white rice is out of supply. The attitude is more or less the same over the years but I find the pricing more and more un-transparent. 3 packets of whatever easily range $12-15 and when I drive past the back of the coffeeshop and seeing how they hang out the chickens I do have doubts hygiene wise. The white chicken rice I bought recently is also full of bones. Not good.
Honestly the best char siew and worth the wait. The char siew is really CHAR and so delicious! We also had the chicken rice and was very delighted!
"Lunch with colleagues here, $34 for 4pax ( 3 rice), mixture of roasted chicken, roasted pork, char siew & duck..

Roasted duck is nice, quite soft and the sauce is yummy...

Roasted chicken is nice too..

Char siew- I asked for fat ones and it's yummy too..

The only not nice one is roasted pork, quite lean and meat is quite hard

Their rice is a bit yellow in color, it was not too bad..

Soup is also ok ok.. Chili is ok ok too..

Overall nice as I was hungry, and didn't have to queue, just had to look for table to sit..

Gave a 5* as the uncle who cuts the meat is friendly, patience and nice..,

Will come again if I pass by the area..."
"Have patronised this stall in this coffee shop for ages. Recently prices shot thru the roof and meat portions got so measly small to be insulting.
No wonder today on a Sunday there is no queue. Should vote with our money by not patronising."
"Was in the vicinity and craved for chicken rice. Saw many good reviews about nan xiang but was left utterly disappointed.

Roast chicken looked good but the minute I took the first bite, I felt so cheated.

The roast chicken was really dry and tough. Roast pork although had nice crisp for the skin, but again the meat itself was a little too dry and bottom part was hard.
Rice was salty. 'Nuff said.

I don't understand the hype here? My regular neighbourhood kopitiam serves better chicken rice than nan xiang.

Would not be coming back for this."
Best Char Siew And Roast Pork !
"Succulent poached chicken, fluffy fragrant rice, good chilli sauce. But no cucumber or greens available for order. Always good to have some sides. Nice but this stall is not for us."
"Affordable and large portion. We ordered char siew, chicken and roasted pork and an egg. Total $17. The meats were great and fatty, but got quite a few bones in the chicken. Rice was abit too salty for my preference... but overall was great. Gotta queue for this. Atmosphere wise got a lot of birds so if u don't like it, u shld just dabao home to try."
"Dec 2024 update:
No longer good. The 7 layers of sio Bak are no longer there. Meat is much leaner now. This is not HappierChoice. Cha siew is also not marinated long enough for the flavours to get in. Beyond the crust, Cha siew meat is Plain and tasteless.

We used to like this place a lot and I'll leave my earlier review from 10+ yrs ago below so that you can see how far it has fallen from grace. I have removed this from my HappierChoice list. Sigh.

---Earlier review below---

Still our favourite place for Cha Siew and Sio Bak. This is the traditional, Unabridged taste and texture which we like. Cha siew is sweet, fat and burnt enough. Sio Bak is roasted till the skin is lightly burnt and crispy. It has that hint of smoky aroma and the resultant skin is crispy and brittle (as opposed to some others which might notionally be deemed ""crispy"" but are outright HARD!)

The roast duck has good flavour and is nicely tender (instead of being rubbery or dry as seen in so many other places). The herbal mix comes through nicely too without being overpowering (as is the case in some chain outlets with central kitchen prep)

That said, HealthierChoice proponents wouldn't like it here. Stay away. Leave this to HappierChoice connoisseurs!"
"The white chicken was so succulent and soft. One of the best I had for quite awhile, like better than the one at Tiong Bahru market. However, the  roast pork i had was a little dry but the skin is crispy and light. The BBQ pork is syiok too, only a light coating of the glaze on the meat and I got the burnt ends portion."
First time trying this stall after seeing some good reviews on TT. The roast duck tasted good but definitely lack the herbal taste that it was reviewed for. The char siew is more to the fatty side and tasted quite tough. The rice that came along tasted the best for the meal.
Roast pork good. Lightly seasoned and crispy.
The OG of chicken and roast pork rice. Gold old school coffee shop vibes. The roast pork and char side is the star and family fav for me
Ordered roast chicken & roast pork rice many times.  Always just 4 pieces of roast meat.. although the roast meat always bid not disappoint.  Very crispy skin...
"Visited on 16 November 2024.

Paid $11 for chicken, roasted pork and Char Siew plus rice.

The most outstanding item was the Char Siew. It was nicely charred and flavorful. One downside for me was that 1/5 of the given portion was fats. I would recommend this option.

The roasted pork was pretty salty for my taste. Not recommended.

Chicken was all right. Can try.

Will not purposely travel to eat this."
"Great plate of roasted chicken , roasted pork and char siew .  Roasted pork is cracking crispy 

Good value!"
"Food is good most of the time but at times they will give you roast pork that are all fats. Happened quite a few times. The guy that chops the chicken and duck as well can be quite a character, at times he would throw the cucumber onto your rice. Good food but poor service especially when the boss is not around."
Good plate of white chicken ric! Very moist and tender! Reasonably priced too!
"very bad, less pork and Blurred. can not eat. will not come again. not worth for you to come."
"We saw good Google reviews, and the stall has  a long queue, so we assumed it must be a standout stall. It was our first time there, and we decided to try the roast chicken, roast duck, roast pork, and char siew. Including three plates of rice, the total cost was $32. We couldn't find the char siew at first, and the stall assistant had to point it out to us--it looked and tasted different from any char siew we've had before. The best items were the roast duck and the fragrant rice. Overall, while it was above average, we've had better options elsewhere, and it wasn't worth the long wait."
"Simply one of the best chicken rice in Singapore. Their roast meat and Char Siew also got standard! Damn shiok...

5years update:

Still shiok. Rice is soso but the chicken, be it roasted or white, I still don't know which to choose ! Both are good! The siobak also shiok!"
Favorite for many years...... Generous portions.
"Recommended by my brother in law to this chicken rice store. Went on 5-10-24 afternoon. Their roast chicken are tender and juicy, slightly salted. The cost is $6."
I ate roasted chicken rice. Very delicious.
"Duck, Roast Pork and Char Siu are the better choices there"
Classic good stuff . Uncles very polite and friendly .  Says they close at 8 but may be earlier cos they sell out pretty fast.  Love the char on the roast pork . Duck is bussin' too.
"Used to be great but lately quality has been down slightly.
I order standard roasted chicken rice which is good"
"Food wise the roast chicken thigh is amazing. Juicy, tender and well marinated. The charsiew is good too. Don't miss this old school gem!"
"This shop cha Siew and pork belly super nice. Is Hong Kong style cha Siew. With the chicken rice, wow, damn nice man."
"Still very good. What's left of my chicken rice and roast pork. !!
Revisited my fav chicken rice stall. Happy to return"
"Crispy roast pork, fragrant rice "
The rice and chilli are exceptional
"This place is more popular for its roasted chicken, but I decided to try the steamed white today. Indeed the chicken is smooth and tender with bits of visible collagen. The rice is fluffy and more yellowish than others and I feel it's not as oily compared to others. The chilli sauce is also more watery than I liked and soup also rather bland. Healthier perhaps??

I ordered the lower part chicken drumstick + thigh and it cost me $15 
In other places $15 probably gets you half a chicken.
Really pricey for a coffeeshop. Do note that they do not have innards like liver and gizzard here."
Steamed chicken is super tender and smooth. Not a fan of the roasted duck. The char Siew and roasted pork is quite good.
One of the best roast meat / duck  / chicken rice in my book.
"Chanced upon this place after dental. Ordered 2 plates of chicken rice with these add ons.

Steamed chicken breast with char siew and egg.

Steamed chicken drumstick with roast pork.

Like it that the meats were cut in thick portions. Both char siew and roast pork were good, had that old school feel to it.

Chicken breast and drumstick was tender and juicy, totally unexpected for the chicken breast.

Will come back here again if ever in this area."
"Had roast chicken and charsiew rice. Everything about this meal was just about average. On the positive end, the roasted chicken was tender and properly seasoned -- the fragrance of the herbs used for marination went well with the rice. The rice was quite flavorful and fluffy, but not oily enough for my taste. Moreover, the charsiew actually wasn't too bad (it had a balanced ratio of meat to fat, there was a decent amount of caramelization etc). However, it still lacked a good pork flavor and was far too sweet. As for negatives, the chili sauce seemed to have been diluted down with water and the soup was almost totally tasteless. For the $7 price tag, I would say there are far better options in Singapore. Nevertheless, this place is still decent for a quick meal."
"Tried their Roast Duck, Roast Pork, Roast Chicken and White Chicken.

The Roast Duck was kinda dry ans doesnt come with any sauce. Roast Pork was very lean.

The Roast Chicken and Steam Chicken were not bad. Soft and tender.

But the Chicken Rice was not fragrant. So can't give them high marks for the Chicken Rice.

All in all, the food was acceptable, but I don't think worth lining up for.

Place was also messy , dirty and really not that appetizing.

Typical old coffeeshop, that has seen much better days.

Probably would'nt come back unless I ran out of Chicken Rice options."
The uncle who cuts the chicken has the most attitude I've ever seen. Chicken rice was mediocre not sure what's the hype about. Can get better chicken rice somewhere else. Not worth visiting. Price was ridiculous. 7 dollars for a plate of chicken rice with char Siew. Char Siew was not marinated well.
Need eating here since child. The roast chicken is my all times favorite
"Chicken rice is not as fragrance as before. Will go for steamed chicken and roast duck.

Nice chicken rice with fragrance that you can smell it a distant away. Roast duck , steamed chicken and roast pork are my favourite.  Their char siew are too fatty and it's not to my liking. Been here for a few years during the weekends. Worth the queue. Highly recommended "
"Been buying from this stall for few years. The char siew is fat and nice, but can have too much burnt (totally black) parts. Roast pork is quite good also. The price has since last year or so risen by quite  a fair bit. Its no longer worthwhile considering the poor service attitude you might get depending on mood of day."
"Used to be fabulous. But the last few times, they got my orders wrong. Today I ordered white chicken leg and roasted duck leg. The latter turned out to be just duck meat, and it didn't seem roasted, more like stewed. No crunch at all. Disappointing. Only white chicken is passable."
"Long time patron. Every visit to Nanxiang is pure delight! Special shout to their roasted chicken that is always tender, juicy, PERFECTLY cooked. We order at least half a chicken every time. Even their chicken breast is scrumptious! Highly recommend  Two persons half a chicken w char siew and rice $27.60. Very nice."
"Ordered a roasted chicken rice with additional roasted pork. The rice and roasted pork are very nice. Together with the chili is fabulous. The eating house is small with limited seatings. Also, parking isn't easy. The queue may be long as many people came to packet. The price for my order is $7.00, slightly above average."
"One of the best chicken rice in town. Chicken is fresh n tender. Roast pork is crispy, char siew is nice n not too dry... and omg the roast duck with sauce... best!!"
The boss is really friendly and the chicken rice and soup are delicious. Had multiple servings of the soup 
"A must try roasted delight stall located in an airy coffee shop that serve up very delicious Char Siew, Roasted Pork, Roasted Duck and Roasted Chicken (all that we tried)

-Char Siew is charred which gives off a very nice BBQ taste
-Roasted Pork is crispy and tender
-Roasted Duck is very juicy and flavorful
-Roasted Chicken is tender and delicious

Rice is taste is not overpowering, so complement the variety of meat nicely.

Do drop by if you are around this area"
"Saw the que but undeterred the siew bak fatty area provide the crunch and 6,00 for duck and roast pork true value for money  ."
"Excellent food, long queue but moved very fast.

Exceptional roast"
"I went there after seeing good reviews in Google reviews.  But there's nothing special,  just chicken and stick rice ball. Portion is not much filling.  Atmosphere also bit low. Food also not mush tasty. It's not a nearby place for me. I went there specifically for chicken rice and I regret it"
"Ordered roasted chicken, roasted pork, char siew and roasted duck.
Very worth its value, $24 only.

Had long but quite a fast moving queue. Meat was packed with flavor and it was a compliment with its fragrant chicken rice."
"Only average chicken rice. Meat is a bit tough n normal taste. The only good thing is they give quite a decent amount of meat for the price. Revisited this again. The meat is simply messy and tough, and bland if not for the sauce."
"Is this the best value chicken rice in Singapore? You can have chicken rice, char siew chicken rice or roast pork chicken rice. Each plate is $5. For me, char siew chicken rice is best. Second generation chicken rice with 50 years history, I was told. Try it, you will not regret."
Taste so-so. Expensive for what it is worth.
"One of the best chicken rice in Eastern Singapore! The roasted chicken is extremely juicy, rice isn't too oily and the char siew is not bad. The portion of chicken serving is generous too. Only downside is the char siew serving portion is quite small for $7."
"this shop is no longer used to be.
the price has increased, quantity also has become smaller, which i can understand.

but the service attitude from the young boss is very bad.

good quality chicken rice is not hard to find in singapore. will not visit again."
"Kinda liked the place and especially the char siew / siew Yok but just today - the price has like risen ridiculously!
One char siew one roast pork and one egg - $11!!
And the char siew cuts were so huge chunks!? Huh?
And siew Yok was oily, and chicken rice was very hard.

Quite a huge difference from last time we came to eat, just earlier this year.
Crazy ! No more!"
A bit pricey but very flavorful juicy meat with crispy skin.
"Nan Xiang Chicken Rice has been around for more than 50 years, with the younger Mr Moh taking over from this father. The highlight is the tender and juicy char siew!!! The roast duck and roast pork are good too. Also love the old corner shophouse coffee shop ambience."
"Ordered chicken rice + roast meat + char siew.. Uncle charge me $10.00.. U can see picture for yourself the portion...the price is absurd for a coffeeshop in this area... This is not raffles place... Food is good but overpriced... Used to buy often here, will probably not come back again."
"Bought a trio of Shao Ya roast duck, Bai Ji steamed chicken and Cha Shao char siew. Char siew has great fat-to-char ratio, and the roast duck was firm and meaty. Without a doubt though, the steamed chicken was the star of the meal. Comes with a hearty bowl of soup which is the PURE essence of chicken. Be prepared for a queue if you come on the weekend. It's worth the wait!"
My go-to place for roast pork and charsiu served with chicken rice. Pretty unique style of charsiu not found elsewhere.
best chicken rice
"Been around for about 40+ years. Favorite roast pork, char siew and roast chicken since childhood."
One of my favourite char siew and roasted pork stall. Choice of fatty char siew and not so fatty char siew. Tender with nice fats in the char siew. Roast pork that is crispy on the skin and tender in the meat. Pair with their chicken rice and hot chill and soup. Lovely combination. The stall has been there for many years. Atmosphere is typical coffee shop.
One of the top 10 chicken rice locations in Singapore. A definite must-try.
"Good roast chicken rice, char siew and roast meat. Roast duck is so so."
"Good meats, however stall could have gone lighter on the salt .. for healthier eat"
"Had chicken rice + sio bak ($5.50) for lunch on 24/12/22, was good."
"Used to be cheap and good, especially the roast pork, but once handed over to next generation, son fully took over and increase roast pork rice for 50% more. From $3 to $4.50. On top of that, the food std dropped 50%. Over time, business dropped, lesser queue but still sustainable, I guess."
"Got the roasted chicken rice and may I add that it is super delicious and highly recommended, it was so good that I added an extra bowl of white rice to savour slowly the taste of the chicken that was well seasoned in sauce."
"10/10 must try! My family has been coming here for years.

$11 even after topping up for a roasted  chicken leg, egg and roasted pork.

Rice is so flavourful and the meat portion is so generous with thick juicy cuts."
"Ordered two persons share of char siew, roasted pork, roasted chicken and boiled chicken and it was truly amazing. One of the best chicken rice in Singapore hands down.

Rice fragrant and fluffy.
White chicken was tender and succulent.
Roasted chicken was tender and juicy.
Roasted pork had a nice crispy skin but the meat was leaning towards tough than tender. Maybe due to being prepared hours ago.
Char siew had parts there were lean alongside the fats. It was also not tough at all and very tender.
Prepared sauces - chilli, ginger sesame oil, dark soy sauce were pretty generic. Chilli isn't spicy but kinda like it that way."
Bought the whole roasted duck for dinner.  The duck is big and taste nice.
"Best traditional singapore style roast duck n Chai siew n roast pork.

1 of the remaining tasty roast duck
Worth to visit often"
"I admit their roast chicken and chasiu  is yummy but their service sucks, their face was damm so black and was like I own them.momey lor."
Specially drove here fo this stall but sadly the char siew is not as nice as what i remember
Great taste. Super tasty! Great value!
"The roast pork, roast duck and char siew is the best. The quality and taste well maintained and controlled. Been patronising here almost twice a week."
"Wow.  The roasted chicken, char siew, and the roast pork here taste fantastic, and is full of the old school taste.  The fat was so flavourful and the cuts of meat was rich, but it is served so simply.  Best Charsiew I had in SG.  Would come again."
Omg. Ordered roast duck with roast pork. Given very generous portion and fulfilling. Both staff placing orders with smile always even long Q. Set good example towards attitude with customers. Definitely must eat stall.
"Not the most high profile, but the best taste chicken rice you can get in SG. The portion was very generous. Rice is fragranced with slight ginger smell and enhanced the flavor of chicken. The steam chicken has the best seasoning and tenderness. Half jellylike gravy goes so well with the rest. Their homemade chili sauce is rly hot, but so shiok! Though the roasted pork is slightly salty, the overall performance is still impressive enough for a full score.
If you settled your fav chicken rice before trying this stall, you are missing a whole new level of chicken rice.
Update: not the best hygiene for dining area, but still as tasty as before."
One of best roast meat stall in the east
Food is nice n the boss is nice.
Crispy Roasted Pork 
4 x chicken rice picked up today and this was the amount of bone and skin left. Ridiculous....
New find for me. Surprisingly good! Happy to find some nice food around the area.
"Old school Roast Meat and Chicken Rice.
Nostalgic little corner!"
Good roasted stuffs. Tried roast chicken n char siew.. Good quality.
"Very good, fragrant chicken rice and big portion. But price increased quite a bit recently."
Really enjoy the good here always!
"Roast meat paradise
Will frequent the stall more if I were staying nearer
Been eating their food for years now.

Can eat for sure

Must order their roast meat!!!

***If you like what I commented and wrote...

"Definitely one of the better chicken rices I've had. My favourite in this area for sure. Chicken is tender and not dry, and the rice is fragrant and flavourful. Can't ask for more."
Chicken rice is economically priced and yummy. Stall closed early around 7pm us.
"So-so roast meat/chicken rice stall. Ordered a small platter of roast chicken breast, siu yok and char Siew, and :

* Siu yok fared the best: fragrant, right amount of saltiness, crispy skin and fatty.
* Chicken breast was tender and fragrant.
* Char Siew's marinade was weird.
* Rice was not fragrant.
* Chilli was very vinegary and tasted somewhat strange. Minced ginger was good."
"Chicken is tender, Sio yok is fatty and flavorful. Just that the char siew have a weird glaze to it."
Xi Huan Zhe Dian De Fei Cha Shao ~ Yummy!!
"The Best So Far for me. !!! Succulent!!! Fatty!!! and Juicy !!! Love it. . 07 Oct 2021 , just drop by for lunch again. Really still delicious and tasty especially the char siew , fattylious. "
"One of the better go-to stalls around the area. Meats are cooked just nice without it going dry especially the char siew. Chicken is always soft and juicy and the siew yoke is nice and subtle with just about the right amount of crisp.

Expect long queues especially during meal hours."
"Great char siew rice, might be best in sg. Steamed chicken was nice too"
The chicken rice is so delicious. The chicken is not dry and the chili is so spicyy
"One of the better chicken rice stall. Not oily and for the price, they do give alot of chicken meat. Friendly seller. Open till 8pm"
Good foods
The Char Siew was really good. Affordable price with quality food.
"This place had amazing roast meat. Succulent, flavourful and they have char siew, duck, hainanese chicken, roasted chicken and roaster pork.

For the rice, u can opt for either white rice or chicken rice. I always go for chicken rice. The chicken rice can be pretty inconsistent but overall I still like it.

So far I ate this stall 4x and out of the 4x, once the rice was not as great. Order 2 meat to go with the rice, it is really good!"
"Hao Chi,Zhi De. "
Best roast chicken and char siew
"Nice & friendly stall owners with good char siew, siew yoke and roasted chicken."

$4.50 1 packet char siew / char shao rice
Above average quality - 4 stars
Above average quantity - 4 stars
Above average price - 1 star
Above average queue / wait time - 2 stars"
"A popular stall that you will see long queue during lunch time. Their Roast chicken is tasty and tender. Their roast pork skin is crispy and char shew is a mix of fatty and lean meat. Served with tasty soup. Their chilli sauce and ginger sauce is nice. Best to go with friends, so you can get abit of every items they have. Recommend to try it. Best go before 12pm."
nice and cheap
Nice chicken rice
Food look good.
Pretty crowded at times but totally worth it.
Solid chicken rice. One of best char siews so far.
This stall has been around for more than 10 years+ and is well known among those who live in the area. The roast chicken is probably the most tender I've tried and sio bak/pork belly is good too. Very nostalgic old school style. They accept cash and PayNow. P.S. try the teh peng from drinks stall
Good roasted pork and char siu 
Fantastic roasted food at affordable price
Very affordable and legit chicken rice. A bit of queue during lunch time but it moves fast. Actually the fatty char siew...is very good at this price point
"Beware the long lunch queues. And if you go by the length of the queues as an indicator of the food, this place definitely need to queue during lunch time!"
"Small hidden gem. Rice was well seasoned, chicken was tender. Love it love it!"
What can I say. It's simply delicious and fragrant. The meat and rice really compliments. I'm saying from a packet of it after 3 hours I tapao home. All the crispy sio bak skin already soggy inside but still it is yummy! Can u imagine eating it at the coffee shop itself?
There are lots of roast specialists here but usually they are only good at one or two of the 'roast meats'. This stall is one of the very rare few where they did well in all.
"Very reasonable, great quality & fantastic soup as well"
"Still one of the best chicken rice, queue started to form after 5.30pm. Roasted chicken just fried, therefore come with crispy skins. The char siew is fantastic, always go for the fatty one. Katong is the only outlet, if you bought from elsewhere, it fake lah."
"Overall was a very average standard, I would said its overrated "
"I'm not even sure if I want to review this place as it has been such a gem! Folks who live in Katong would know this as the best chicken rice in Marine Parade. Humble place, not many seats during lunch time and no aircon. But if you aren't fussy about the environment, this is one good singaporean meal you will not forget. 5 stars. No doubt."
"Really good meat, and affordable too"
Cheap and very good
"22 Nov, bought 1 packet to try from Novena SQ.
Tried, rice full of salt, added eggs, also salty. Rice not fragrant. Terrible. Worse than chicken rice in Clementi Hawker center. Not worth the price. Very disappointing.."
"I fail to understand the hype on google reviews. Chicken was so dry and hard, and the char siew was plain mediocre."
"Juicy roasted and steamed chicken, roast and barbecue pork. Yummy. Been here many times. Will come back too."
"That's a lot of meat for only $6! A queue is always seen here, with people ordering half/whole chicken for takeaway.

This is my ranking of the three meat I ordered:
1 - Roast pork for its crispy skin
2 - Roast chicken with tender juicy flesh and a thin chewy skin
3 - Char siew which weren't as charred as I hoped. Can skip this.

I'll choose this stall for my roasts whenever I'm in this area. It felt like an old school and honest stall, at a very affordable price. Missing the roast chicken thigh already.."
"According to the staff, the stall is so popular that the Queue will start to form after 10.30am everyday!

The char siew is probably the best (but provided you get the part with fats, not totally lean meat).  Next will be the Roasted Chicken the meat is so soft.  The skin of the sio-bak is crispy and the fat meat is soft as  most of the oil has been removed during the roasting process."
"Char Siew was the best among the 4 - Roast chicken, duck and Siew Yoke. Queue can be long at lunch but moves pretty quickly"
"Definitely Worth the calories!
We ordered too much for 3 though.
Charsiew was really good."
The Roast Pork is SO GOOD melts in your mouth with crispy skin .. *cry
Good roast chicken rice and cha sui! Is really tender and flavour is all there! Usually have a queue during peak periods.
"This place serves old school no-frills char siew (seasoned barbecued pork), roast chicken, roast duck and sio bak (roast pork). The charred fatty cuts of meat are pretty much amazing, and I'm partial to the roast pork and roast chicken. It's also reasonably priced, at around S$4-6 for a packet of chicken rice. Ask for the dark meat (chicken thigh) instead of the leaner cuts. Trust me, it's worth the calories.

The stall is located within the coffeeshop named ""Keng Bee Restaurant"" at the corner of the building facing the Caltex gas station. Seating within the coffeeshop is limited and there's parking at the back. The line is out the door pretty much at lunchtime, so do come early before they sell out.

Depending on how long the line is, the guy at the stall might get a little grouchy or impatient with you. I also have to knock them for a less than stellar chilli sauce which is practically watered down beyond recognition.

The stall is closed on Tuesdays, and a different hawker helms the evening shift at the same stall, so be aware that the food served might be different at dinner.

TLDR; Old school roast chicken and roast pork with charred fatty cuts, reasonably priced but a bad attitude with a long wait. Good, cheap, fast, well you can only pick two!"
"Xian Xiang Pi Cui De Shao Rou,Rang Wo Ting Bu Liao Kou. "
Good place for chicken rice. Must order the barbeque pork also
Come here for the Duck rice
"This has to be Katong's favourite chicken rice store. I've been going there for more than 40 years and it's just as good then and now. Char Siew, chicken, rice and soup all very nice. Not expensive also. Expect to queue when you go."
Cheap and good.  Have been eating here since I was 13. I'm now 46.
"Usually not a fan of fatty meat, but this has got to be one of the best charred char siew I've eaten! Unknowingly ate half the plate by myself!  #buzzfeast #dailyfoodfeed #delicious #eeeeeats #feedfeed #foodbeast #foodgasm #foodiegram #foodielife #foodiesofinstagram #foodlover #foodography #foodpic #foodpics #onthetable #heresmyfood #instayum #smartfoodchoices #tastemade #foodphotography #foodblogger #fooddiary #foodforfoodies #hungrygowhere #tripadvisor #chope #burpple #letsguide"
Not just another chicken rice stall but one whose roasted pork is also exceptional. This is probably the best chicken rice in the east!
"Nan xiang chicken rice taste great , best Char Siew & Chicken ($4.50 per packet ) I Eaten , another stall sells breakfast Fried Noodles"
Ordered char siew and roast chicken. Both was marinated and cooked well. The portion was generous as well. Only minor gripe was rice was a bit too soft. Nevertheless still a satisfying meal. Worth a try!
The chicken rice is very nice and price is reasonable. Very hard to find one in Singapore now.
Very good. Mixed roast.meats that very tasty and moist. The roast pork was really good. Nicely done chicken rice too. Queue was big and very slow which didn't make sense but it was worth the wait
Love the roast pork. Duck is gd but a little pricey
"A very popular place for Roast Duck, Roast Chicken, Char Siew, Roast Meats and stream white chickens. A wide variety to choose from. There is always a queue during lunch time. A good place for lunch."
Regular place
Good food chicken duck char siew and roast pork. Long queue. A lot of takeaway customers. I have been eating there since my teenage days. Started by selling cheap chicken rice sets to students from neighbourhood schools. CNY I use to order duck and roast pork. The stall has done very well and now employees do the portioning.
"Just went for Sunday lunch and queue is Long. We ordered roasted pork, char siew with a roast duck drumstick for two paxs, very authentic Hong Kong style but that day the roast pork a little too salty. The service is fantastic, the workers all are very polite. It is worth queuing and the price is very reasonable. Will definitely patronise again."
"Something that should not be missed is their char siew! The rice, duck and chicken is alright but the char siew is in a league of its own."
Best chicken and char Siew.
"Very good stuff! Their char siew is juicy and fatty with burned ends.
Chicken is succulent and the rice fragrant.

Definitely better than Kay Lee Roast Meat. In my opinion, it is one of the most underrated Char Siew Siew Yoke place in this country."
"Very accessible and easy to locate, food taste great and affordable. This stall doesn't need much introduction as it has already made a name for itself around the neighborhood. For first timer, order their fatty char siew (honey roasted pork) as well as roast chicken, 10/10 you won't be disappointed. Will always recommend my friends whenever they are around the area. Premise is non-air conditioned, but I doubt anyone will mind after they tasted the food."
No frills chicken and rice. Choose from 2 types of chicken or char siew/roast pork. Rice was fragrant and flavorful.
Great chicken rice. The portions of meat were generous. Chilli was great to go with the rice. Rice wasn't as aromatic as expected. But the chicken and char Siew made up for it. Worth going again!
"Good standard for roast pork, char siew and chicken.  I usually asked for the lean portion of meat but today, the roast pork was with more fat than meat."
Best roasted pork and char Siew rice in town! You will never regret that!
Best in the world Shao La
Thumbs up Char Siew from this stall. Try it to believe.
"The best damn roast pork, char Siew, roast duck and chicken rice ever! All the meat is juicy and tasty. Melts in your mouth!!! It has never disappointed and the best part? It's inexpensive"
Minum air je..kena review jgk ke
The former standard was better.
The roasted items here are really good and prices are cheap.
Superb chicken rice by Tanjong Katong Road. Google mentioned it was closed but it was open when I went at 2pm on a Saturday. Char Siew also very nice.
High marks for the chicken rice and roasted pork
"Chicken N sio bak = SGD 4, FOOD delicious, big portion N cheap"
Nostalgic. Always good.
Not so nice
Love chicken rice! Best in Singapore. The sauces were awesome
"This popular chicken rice always commands a long queue during lunch and dinner and always sold out fast. Decide to come try on a weekend and most of the meats were sold out. Highly recommend the roast chicken and Charsiew here. for $4, the portion was really generous."
I walked passed this coffeeshop along Tanjong Katong Road and found a small queue at this chicken rice stall even before lunch time. So I ordered a plate of roasted children rice with roasted pork belly. The chicken rice was very fragrant and the portioned served is quite good. The chicken was not so tender maybe because it was roasted. The roasted pork belly was a bit saltish. But overall it was priced reasonably at $4.00.
Very tasty chicken rice! Rice is fluffy. Chicken is juicy and roast pork is nicely charred and crispy! Will be back to try the duck n charsiew.
Best chicken rice in Singapore I say! Well roasted meats and the homemade sauces is the bomb!
Been eating here for quite awhile. Everything is made in house even the chili! Must try but be prepared for a queue. Oh at $3 a pack the serving size is ridiculously good!
World class food
"I happened to pass by when I was going to eng's for wanton mee and I saw a long queue. Even tho this place is called nan xiang chicken rice, it's actually better for charsiew and sioba.

The charsiew is kind of a hit or miss, you should try to ask for a fatty cut or you'll end up with tough meat. The sioba is pretty decent. I would eat this if I stayed nearby, but I wouldn't travel to eat this."
"Waited for 30 minutes for lunch, but the char siu was worth it.  It was charred and a little fatty, which added to the taste.  Also had the roasted pork and roast chicken, but the char siu was the standout.

Price was really reasonable - $7.50.

Long queues as many were also packing the food, in addition to eating there."
"excellent quality, very tasty and reasonable price. long queue but service is very fast."
My all time favorite Chicken Rice stall along Tanjong Katong Road.  This stall has being around for over 50 years and I have been patronizing this stall since my early childhood in the 70s!
price getting expensive as compare to previous
Long queues especially during lunchtime and weekends. Roast pork is mouth watering. Don't despair if there are no tables as most diners takeaway so it's a short wait. Veges can be ordered from the zi char. Kopi is nice.
"The char siu here is awesome. The chicken rice here is also nicely made, but definitely not the star. Their chilli sauce is nice. The also have other varieties of roast meats here like pork and duck. Very affordable and parking is plentiful so easy to get to."
Best Chicken ever for me. Highly recommended
It is a popular stall in the area judging by the queues. The quality and value of the chicken rice are acceptable. The condition of the coffee shop is rather rundown.
"Very good roasted pork! Generous, big cuts and crispy skin. Love it!"
Nice food. Will return when near by
Excellent charsiew & roasted pork!  Long queues always during peak hours
"Old school type, very nice and notice it is very crowded during lunchtime. Do note they are closed on Tuesday"
"Popular chicken rice in Tanjong katong.
Good amount of meat for $3.50 if u on diet ..dont eat..too fatty ..and oily..
Q too long.. as it is cheap..
Good parking available."
"Bad roast duck n bad service, overrated! Won't go again!! Waste my stomach!!!"
"One of tve best chicken rice in that area. Many tables. The queue  can be long but is good because  meanwhile you que 1 table will be available. There are also 2 more stalls, baos, nudles soups, vegetables and drinks. If you like chicken  one of the best. Quite affordable"
My grandfather's shop leh. How can i rate it less than 5stars.
Delicious chicken rice at affordable price
Always long queue outside the stall. Rice is nice and fluffy but chicken taste average to me. worth a try but not worth the queue
"Ordered white chicken with char Siew for two. The chicken is tender and the char Siew, as everyone says has nice proportion of fats and charred meats that is soft and tasty. But the ginger sauce and chilli sauce is a letdown, so watery and mild. Rice is quite good also."
"Roast Duck with crispy skin,  BBQ Cha Siew POrk! suggest to try fat Chasiew where the fats melts in your mouth!!"
michelin 1 star in my heart
Good place for dinner and meet up
Best Chicken Rice hands down
Used to frequent this stall for the past 10 years but on my recent visit i was charged $12 for ordering chicken drumsticks and thigh without rice. i was taken abacked so i double checked it with the lady and she said $12 so i just paid and left. I think there is a change in the cook/owner as the regular uncle that chops the chicken has changed and the chicken does taste a little tougher and harder even though it was the drumstick.!
Old school taste and good value
Cheap and good
Delicious duck and chicken and char siew and shao rou
The charsiew and siew yuk is very delicious and juicy.
"There's no shortage of chicken rice hawkers, but this is one of my favourites: delicious, unpretentious and a bargain at $3. Be prepared to queue though, as it can be over 30 mins wait at peak hours."
There are 2 operators for lunch and dinner. Prefer the evening boss
Juicy and thick meat. Value for it's price. Place is quite stuffy during the afternoon.
"Roast chicken is tender and juicy. Chicken rice smell and taste good. The char siew is a little fatty and more chewy than the regular lean one. The roast pork is very crispy. It can be very crowded during the lunchtime period. My friends and I had all of the above food, and cost per pax is about $8. Overall nice food with decent proce."
Decent Roasted Chicken Rice. Their Char Siew & Roast Pork is not bad as well.  Can get rather crowded during meal time.
The chicken rice has no chicken rice taste. I was quite disappointed with the rice.
"Nice roast pork,  tender roast chicken, for charshiu shd ask for half fatty meat as the lean one is a bit dry tough.   Chicken rice is good & not too oily, must try with their fragrant black soya sauce. Helpful & friendly staff. After 1130 q starts building up & lot of dabao which take sometimes."
"Delicious chicken, roasted char siew rice (pork), etc. Great service from the owner & staffs."
"Expect to queue during lunch. Pretty good meal, worth the wait."
"Most delicious roasted duck, char siew and roasted pork."
Be here before 1130am to avoid long waits.  Roast duck and char siew are the best and cheap
"Now they improve their Business a lot!. Theirs ingredients not bad, price can accept!Yi Qian Jiu Hen Nan Chi,(Fan Cai Du Hen Ying)!Xian Zai De Tai Du Hen Qin Qie!"
Freaking expensive 1 meat and 1 vegetable with small rice at SGD5.2. Feel like being robed
I tink generally the women server at nighy is grumpy and rude. Rice is prepackage in the container to save time... if i was the owner o would fire her.
"Food is nice and big portion, but price is higher than average. Service could be better for the cashier."
"Bardzo fajne miejsce, gdzie mozna zjesc pierozki dim sum i porozmawiac z ludzmi."

"Hot food center.dim sum is of standard. Prawn dumplings, rice with chicken and fried prawn dumplings. though normal,my favourite dim sum place"
Siew Mai is very nice. Chicken feet and Hai Gao slightly above average. Prawn in beancurb skin is quite nice tho it looks a little pale 
Very good dim sum esp the smooth porridge w reasonable price n friendly service. Close on Wednesday.
"It's ok, decent food at a decent price. Can skip the Xiao Long Bao."
"First time had the Cheung fun and Siu Mai

pretty legit nice flavours and seasoning."

"Porridge is very nice.  The rest are good too. They were there the longest time.  Didn't ask them but definitely more than 32 years, the age of my son."
Must try if you are in the vicinity!
"Popular dim sum spot for a reason! Har gao's skin thickness is just right, the prawn filling is not coated with flour and good. Can be quite a wait but aunty by the cashier tries her best to make it as seamless as possible"
"Taste test:
I ordered from both Neptune dim sum and it's ""next door"" competitor which I don't wanna mentioned its name. Turns out both siew mai and the chee cheong fun are far superior than its competitor. The siew mai actually has real prawn in it and I can't really find chunky prawn meat in the competitor one."
"If you're looking for DIM SUM THAT DELIVERS on taste and quality, Neptune Hong Kong Dim Sum is the place to go!

I ordered Har Gow, Char Siew Chee Cheong Fun and Century Egg Porridge.

Har Gow: WOW, the har gow here is NEXT LEVEL!  The shrimp was so plump and fresh, you can TASTE the quality with every bite. The dumpling skin? Perfectly thin and translucent but somehow doesn't break, even when you pick it up with chopsticks (and I'm not gentle with these things ). They serve it steaming hot, and you can tell it's made fresh, not sitting around. Paired perfectly with their chili sauce--spicy but not overwhelming. If you're a dim sum lover like me, you KNOW a good har gow is the ultimate test, and this one PASSES with flying colors.

Char Siew Chee Cheong Fun: I wasn't expecting to love this as much as I did, but WOW. The rice rolls were silky smooth, literally glided into my mouth. The char siew inside was so flavorful--sweet, a little smoky, with that caramelized edge that makes it irresistible. The soy sauce was light but SO FRAGRANT, not too salty, just the right balance. It's one of those dishes that looks simple, but when done right, it's MAGIC. Portion size is pretty generous too. I kept telling myself I'd stop after one piece...then two...and suddenly it was gone. 

Century Egg Porridge: OMGGG this is COMFORT IN A BOWL.  The porridge was velvety smooth, not watery at all, and had that rich, slow-cooked flavor you only get from hours on the stove. The century egg was creamy, no weird aftertaste, and paired perfectly with the tender pork slices. The best part? The crispy fried dough sticks they give on the side--dipping those into the porridge is a GAME CHANGER. The portion was enough for 2 people if you're sharing, but honestly, I wanted it all for myself. This is a MUST-ORDER, especially if you want something warm and filling.

Overall, Neptune Dim Sum just hit ALL the right notes for me. The food was fresh, flavors were on point, and the portions were good for the price. Plus, the service was quick, even though it was SUPER crowded. HIGHLY RECOMMEND for dim sum lovers!! I will be back for sure to try the other dishes."
Love their steamed chicken rice Sauce so yummy
"Already 3/4 full after a hearty meal. However, there's still 1/4 space left. Decided to walk around in the food center to see what's 'little but tasty enough' to fill up the space. Saw this Neptune HK dim sum. Ordered har gow, char siew bao and fried prawn bean curd skin roll $13.50 in total. Lady boss politely asked me to return in 10mins time. After a while, I went to collect my dim sum. Each serving came with 3 pieces. The serving was generous. I simply assume a normal fare in food center for such dim sum. I was so wrong, I took the fried prawn bean curd skill roll, the skin roll filled with generous portion of prawn, sotong paste and freshly fried. Seriously, I am a dim sum regular. This is by far the best tasting bean curd skin roll and with that raised my expectation for har gow and char siew bao. Both did not disappoint me, I was overwhelmed by the freshness, taste and serving. Har gow and char siew bao taste equally good. Too bad now I am 100% full. I will come again to try the other dim sum! I will never judge food center dim dum as not comparable to restaurant ever again. Food centers dim sum can have HK master class sifu."
"Ate this stall since young when I had tuition at Parkway centre till today working adult! Aunty timsum no doubt quality is still there and most important affordable! Must try their glutinous rice, I would say it's one of the best in Singapore!"
Deep fried shrimp dumpling is nicely fried and delicious.
"The food served was honestly superb. However, the foul attitude of the owners can totally ruined my appetite. Could be kinder to people in responses. Treat people how you would like to be treated!"
"One of my favourite Hong Kong Style Dim Sum.
For the price and the fact its in a Hawker Center, the quality is really good.

I love their Ha Cheong (Prawn Rice Rolls)"
"Lived in Hong Kong and Macau for 12 years, I understand what is a good dim sum. Pleasantly surprised, a decent restaurant standard at Hawker price. Today's cheong fun was thin and soft, perhaps a better chef today? Wish the filling was heartier. Har Kaw were very good and Lo Mai Gai decent."
Very good old-school dim sum.  Try the steam carrot cake!
"Chang Fen De Diao Wei Jiang You Hao Chi,Fen Chi Qi Lai Ye You Xiang Wei. Xia Jiao He Shao Mai Wu Gong Wu Guo,Ke Jia Niang Dou Fu Man Xin Qi De Wei Dao Ye Bu Cuo. Peng You Xi Huan Fu Pi Juan,Mei You You Chou Wei,Huan Man Hao Chi De. Shi Cai Xin Xian De Gan Jue. "
All these 3 dishes for $11/-.  Cheapest alternative dim sum quick fix that saves you the 10% service charge and 9% GST.  Quality wise can-do but forgo the Chang Fen.  Tasted like factory made skin too thick.  Will try the Phoenix stall next time
Love to visit them for Hong Kong Dim Sum. The items were adequate. Remember to try their Fried Tofu Hakka Style. Nice black bean sauce. The lady Owner very friendly.  Price was reasonable. Located within Marine Parade Hawker Centre. Many seats available and the place is airy and ventilation is good.
"Tasty and not-too-expensive dim-sum in hawker centre. The har kow skin and crystal dumplings skin were thin and porridge was smooth and nice without being salty.  Pork ribs were soft and tender. Hawker centre was airy and despite being a weekend morning, had sufficient seats. Waiting time for food was decent too."
"Recommended siew mai and hat gow, har gow skin is thin and tasty. Chee Cheong fun also a must try. Definitely will visit again."
Very honest in doing business which focus on the old folks in the area
"Still the good old taste. food is nice and price is decent. try the hakka tofu, and char siew bao."
"Overall, it is tasty and reasonable. Recommend Hakka Yong Tou Fu, surprisingly impressive. The Shimp rolls are so good.
Xiao Long Bao is so so.
Sauce for Chee Cheong Fun is good."
"Date of visit: 01 Sep 23
Time of visit: 0950am
Nearest mrt: not ready yet
Items ordered: 1x prawn chee cheong fun, 1x har gau, 1x prawn fu pi juan
Total damage: SG$12.50
How: You find your own seat you queue, you order, you pay, they ask you come back 8min later, they make, you collect, you take pic, you eat, you clear, you go.
Pros: none
Cons: Hawker center, quite stuffy inside. Dont believe the 8 minutes, she don't remember your order, whoever stayed there and bug her more will get the food 1st.
Will eat again: no"
"#1 Fresh Shrimp Chee Cheong Fun $4 (6/10)
Whilst I was excited to see the dim sum steaming baskets, I was disappointed by the quality of their chee cheong fun.

While the rice rolls had a smooth texture, the thickness of the rolls, and small prawns enveloped within left more to be desired.

There were no queues at 1130am."
Shrimp Chee Cheong Fun has a nice smooth texture. Hakka Yong Tau Fu is worth the 10-minute wait when served piping hot deep fried.
"Aunty is very hard working.  A old customers asked how long she is here.  Boss replied 28 years lo.  wow..!! older then me.

I had Steam pork ribs rice and Chicken feet.

will try others item next round."
"Ordered Har gao, siew Mai & char siew cheong fun. @ $4 each. Siew Mai came in 4. Nothing amazing.

The 3 Har gao was decent, skin is acceptable for hawker standard, slightly dry which made it tore easily.

Cheong fun was surprisingly good. I would like to try more next time. Service was quick."
walked past and decided to sit down for a snack. ordered the hakka ytf and century egg porridge and both were delicious!! very flavorful and the ytf sauce was so yummy. also shoutout to the soy sauce mix they gave us when we asked for some soy sauce haha uncle says it's their own recipe and it's so tasty :-)
I am a regular customer for breakfast. I like the porridge and chicken feet. So these were what i got for breakfast this morning. It is not crowded early in the morning. Reasonable price. Total $6.60.
Ok quality but expensive.
Love the Tim Sum from this stall. Good quality at reasonable price.
"Siu mai is nice, far from the typical peperry type usually sold at hawker centers. Pork ribs are very tender, with just the right hint of spiciness.  Char siew pao was alright."
Good Dim Sum at affordable price in a hawker centre. Tried half of their items and mostly better than other Dim Sum stalls. Also got my favourite steam carrot cake which is hard to find elsewhere. Seems to be taken off the menu in most other Dim Sum stalls.
CAN TRY place .. among the better
Last known HK Dim Sum. Eating here for the last 30 years. From the famed Neptune.
"Restaurant quality dim sum in Marine Parade Food Centre. We recommend the Black Fungus Chicken Rice, Steamed Glutinous Rice, Century Egg Congee, Steamed Carrot Cake and Har Gaw. Come early because some dishes get sold out sometimes."
"Chee Cheong Fun, Har Gao, Siew Mai

Starting the morning right with some good dim sum. Quite decent but nothing special. The lovely aunty at the stall was really friendly especially when she found out we can speak Hakka.

The only comment I had was the chee cheong fun seems to be thicker than my liking. But the taste itself is okay.

Overall, it's acceptable. Would definitely be back for more."
"Jun 2022
Still the same people. The fried prawn dumpling is how I rem it. The steam prawn dumpling is crunchy and big. Can skip the Char Siew bun, too little filling.

4 years ago
Good dim sum at affordable prices. Chef came fr Hongkong which explains the good taste."
Various types of products and cheap.
Love their dim sum and porridge
"Tasty dim sum served in hawker place. Average price about 4 dollars per plate. Be prepared to wait on the weekend mornings. Suggest you remember the few persons in front of you to keep track of your turn to get your food. My faves are siew mai, pork ribs, fried prawn beancurd roll and lotus leaf rice. 4 instead of 5 because the portion size seemed to have become smaller."
"Be selective eating here.  As a former resident of  dim sum heaven, i lowered my expectations because this is a hawker stall. Yet, the siew mai and har kow (my gauge for a good dim sum place) are totally Cannot Make It.

Some saving grace here: The char siew bun here is good. So is the steamed chicken rice. I will only come back for these."
"Address according to Google Map shows #01-176.
Address according to photo from shop shows #01-26."
"Another day, another frustrating food explore with the seemingly hardly accurate Google map info nowadays."
Disappointed. Siumai was a disappointment - dry and lacks flavour. Charsiu pau barely have any filling. $19.50 for these. Will not return.
"Price:
A Little on the high side for Hawker Center.
Payment via Cash only.

Food:
Liu Sha Bao and Durian Sha Bao (Custard Buns) are probably factory packed and not handmade. It's not worth the money

I also had a Steamed Carrot Cake was very fragile and fell apart quite easily, the ingredients were delicious but it felt very watery.

Xiao Long Bao was very underwhelming, there was two out of three which I ate that did not have any juices inside - which was the main ingredient for Xiao Long Bao.

Overall:
If you are craving for some Dim Sum, this store can satisfy your cravings."
Nice dim sum traditional style
"3-3.5 stars.

Food quality:
+ Chee Cheong Fun, steamed carrot cake, Chee Cheong fun, fried tofu are above average.
- Their buns (durian, Liu Sha Bao) aren't great :(

Food portion / Price:

Crowd: Expect some delay due to need to heat up your order, and some propels who have ordered before you - but nothing ridiculous. Buzzer will sound to pick up your order.

Payment: Cash only.

Will update more as try more."
A nice breakfast dim sum gem in the east :) Was looking for a place for early breakfast at 730am. It is nice that it opens early. The cheong fun were freshly made upon request as I did not want any fillings. The texture of this cheong fun is thicker than another hawker outlet we frequent.  Century egg porridge was a tad salty to my liking. The dumpling that I ordered was well seasoned but I did not like the fake crab meat filling in it. I guess this is a reasonably priced hawker dim sum place since we can't travel overseas to Canton for now.
The auntie was very nice and spoke with a strong Cantonese accent. The dim sum was only so-so. The fried durian pastry was very nice tho!
Found the dim sum to be about average.
"Original HK style dim sum. Have been patronising this stall since I was young and standards have not dropped. Lady boss is from HK and dim sum is authentic. If you have only stomach for 1 item, just go for the Hakka ytf. Never disappoint. Go early for the century egg and mince pork congee.. it's superb!"
"Horrible service!

I was here on the 6 March for breakfast

1) no proper queue. ppl were standing everywhere and if u managed to get your voice heard then you are first. The boss does not care

2) the owner show no interest at all in confirming my order even after i managed to get her attention.

They are not cheap, and the dim sum is not the most fabulous in singapore. For such sub-standard attitude and service towards customer I would stay away and enjoy the other better dim sum in Singapore."
"the owner ordered me to return the tray to her, then told me to put the crockery to the washing conveyor belt without the tray. Well, she wanted to save her deposit for the tray. Horrible attitude"
"Really like their dim sum, it was as good as I first had it 20+ years ago."
"Great way to start your day - I recommend siew mai, crystal dumpling, steamed pork with black bean & red chili, prawn stuffed tofu, deep fried prawn roll plus excellent porridge or Chee Chong fun"
"black durian puff (probably puree type and not so fresh)
Steam carrot cake (too much soya sauce)
xiao long bao.
Aunty was rather impatient and rude. (attitude was like what u want!)"
"Sadly they do not serve the ""dragon ball"" anymore. The rest are still pretty good though!"
"Chee Cheong fun is normal, even though I understand they make it from scratch here"
"Pleasant and affordable. One of the highlight is the hakka tofu, and I was pleasantly surprised! Their siew mai is so-so. Ha-Gao is okay, prawn size is generous. The steam carrot cake is plain and pleasant. I also like it. The Chee Cheong fun and char siew buns are nice."
"Okay dim sum, not terrible and not great for the price. Portions are a little small. Siu mai was quite chewy/rubbery."
Nice dim sum stall in hawker center.
"Generally nice. Not expensive. However i find the Bun (pao) items not nice, skin is too thick for my liking. Good choice a breakfast with friends or family."
"Nice dim sum place located at marine parade hawker centre. Can get quite crowded during the weekend, waiting time for XLB to cook takes about 6mins. Typically takes around 15-20min from queuing to getting all of your food during peak period. Food quality is good for the price"
"Standard drop drastically.

The worst Har Kao I ever eaten.
Chee Cheong Fun also terrible with unfresh prawn.
Siew Mai was basic.
Lotus Rice portion was a little small.
Prawn Dumpling was not too bad."
"Good food good price, freshly make"
"Located at the back row of Marine Parade hawker centre is this old school dim sum stall. With the chef and owner from Hong Kong, the dim sum is definitely authentic and made from scratch.

Nothing is frozen and they steam dishes only upon ordering so you are guaranteed freshness.

Har gow skin is thin and translucent with shrimps having a nice crunchy bite. Charsiew Bao is fluffy and the sweet-savoury filling generous and chunky."
"Satisfying old school traditional dim sum in a hawker centre. Order 9 dishes and only $30. Very traditional good quality dim sum with no frills, but no trendy things like custard bun. Try their Xiao long bao, Siew Mai, Malay cake, char siew bao."
"They have been in business for ac long time. Good nasi lemak. The Chilli is the star, not too spicy n more sweet. The chicken, fish ,etc ingredients are not bad. They close quite early though, so best buy in the morning. Usually just get their Set C n ask for more Chilli"
Freshly cooked comfort food. Fried chicken wings are so crispy and juicy with fragrance nasi. Washed down with a cup of teh-C. Very satisfied lunch.
Nasi Lemak is really old school and yummy. The sambal is on point classic. Wings damn good. Ikan bilis crispy and so were the fishes.
"Had nasi lemak ($4.50) for breakfast on 26/5/24, was good! Love the sambal chilli. Fresh and yummy."
"Uncle Aziz sells the best nasi lemak ! try his speciality chili, so sedap :)"
"As it was the Chinese new year period, there was limited food choice available. We happen to be around Marine Terrace and chance upon this stall selling malay food. Apart from Nasi Lemak, they also sell other stuff like curry puffs and kuehs. They offers 3 different sets from SGD$4.50 onwards.

I ordered the set A which consist of a slice of fried egg, cucumber and ikan bilis, sambal chili and the fried chicken wing. The rice was fragrant but mushy. chicken wing wasnt cleaned properly, there are still feather attached to the wings. The cucumber that was served to us already turned sour. The chicken wing was crispy but bland, no seasoning.

Overall, a pretty bad plate of nasi lemak if you asked me. They still have the cheek to impose festive period surcharge for such bad food. Avoid at all cost."
Used to be my go to Nasi Lemak when I move to Katong area . Lately the standard has drop drastically just wonder why.
"One of the best Malay style nasi lemak in Singapore. All the components like coconut rice, anchovies and fried chicken wings are made so well. Even the way they properly fold the takeaways is impressive!"
Very excited that I've found a good tasting Mee Rebus ($4 only) with gravy that is thick and rich in spices! The Nasi Lemak chili is also quite good. Will try the Lontong next!
"Tasty nasi lemak. Chicken wings are tender and fresh, the chilli is abit sweet and sour and it goes well together with the rice."
I have been coming here for nasi lemak for the longest time. Great traditional Malay nasi lemak with very tasty add ons. Sotong and Rendang a must try. Best chilli.
Decent for a neighborhood nasi lemak. Went during lunchtime so the chicken wings and fish were fresh and hot. Chilli is ok too.
"Sincere Feedback. I have been having this Nasi Lemak for years. I moved out from Marine Parade recently but went back for the same dish and it's disappointing to say the least. Rice is dry and not fragrant. Chicken is totally tasteless. 1 bite and I am asking myself, how can I finish this dish."
"This old-school style Nasi Lemak from Muslim-owned ""Hot & Spicy Nasi Lemak"" stall has always drawn a crowd. I have had it a few times myself - usually when the queue at my favourite #132traditionalteochewnoodle (they are in the same coffeeshop) has too long a queue and I don't have the time to wait. These days, it is manned by the younger folks, so I guess the next generation has taken over the business.
Besides the hearty portions of ready-planned Nasi Lemak Sets A, B and C which come with the basics and either fried ikan kuning or chicken wings, you can add on other items as well because they also offer a decent spread of dishes which include sambal goreng, begedil, fried tempeh, taukwa, sayur lodeh etc."
Chilli very diluted and not concentrated and sometimes got sour smell it's seem like the chilli is going to turn bad. Overall not good to eat.
Nice and tasty nasi lemak that worth eating. The chilli and rice goes well together. Chicken wings are tender and juicy. Worth eating!
"If you order ala carte without realizing there is a set meal, you'll find yourself being charged the same amount for lesser ingredients. Storekeeper not honest to tell you that. Oh well they get to save 1 fried egg but they lose a returning customer."
This small bag costs $4
"I tend to fall into my own trap all the time. The 'mee pok' stall was once again disappointing, so I tried to make up with this, hoping that it'll up the satisfaction of the lunch. But it's not done anything other than adding on the calories already 'wasted'. Maybe expectations were wrong, this is a decent neighborhood nasi lemak stall, and that's all it is - not a famed institution that one would travel across the island for. Averagely average."
"Over priced. Cold rice and chicken wings
Don't even have peanuts. Lousy service"
"Reasonable price, big portion, very generous with the ingredients. A great bowl of porridge. Must try for porridge lovers."
Pork porridge  - 1 January 2025
"Standard has dropped drastically & you don't get what u paid for. Even after feedback about missing ingredients, chef doesn't even offer slight discount back, simply look away & just brushed off as next round then.

Same issues today as my last round of dining. Thought I'll give it another chance again today as it may be a one off but it's not. Won't be back again.

Thank you for the meal despite being shortchanged. I hope chef finds his passion back again & reverts to preparing quality congee like how he 1st started."
"Ordered century egg & pork ball porridge, added pork ball & egg and paid a total of $6.50. However the price doesn't justify the amount of ingredients I had. On top of that, one of the very few pork ball I had, had a strand of HAIR in it and I had to discard it........ so disappointed with this stall. Looked great but not filling enough and perhaps no proper sanitary guidelines too."
"Quality: Poor
The congee was rather diluted, doesn't give me the 'thick and filling'  texture that I was expecting. It's a little too salty and also gave me the weird aftertaste that lingered for a while

Service: Poor
The pork congee that I took has 3 price range ($4/5/7). The hawker didn't bother to ask my preference and asked for $4 when the congee was served.""Is there a $5 serving?  I asked.""  ""It's already done"",  a rude and impatient reply.

Value for money : No
While can't asked for much on a $4 meal, the congee is diluted, approx 5-6 razor thin pork slices and some miserable bits of fried dough(you tiao).

Come back again? : Definitely NO."
Came on 3.30pm Tuesday 22/10 and shutters are down/closed. Please update
"Fish congee ... Miserable..
Maybe it was a bad day..."
"Very bad experience purchase here
Take away box charged and plastic also another charge ?! Do you expect customer to take away without carrier ? I think it's stupid . All other market standard stall they don't charge but only this stall . And the boss attitude also bad . Will not come back again

Portion for the ingredient is little"
"Came at 6pm on a Wed evening, the shutters are already half closed. Dont understand hawker who don't even bother to update their operation hours."
"The fish bits and thinly sliced. Serving portion could have been more generous and I'm sure your business will flourish along as well!

Taste of the porridge and texture is . Pork is fresh, fish bits taste abit fishy and spring onions could have been more to make it a heartier meal. Thanks for giving a good size of Youtiao. Overall still able to enjoy but not filling for a proper meal that's for sure!"
"Restaurant quality, fresh ingredients, friendly and super efficient. $6.50 for my special mix."
4th generation congee. They have the recipe down pat!  I got the large bowel with chicken and added an extra egg. Made fresh. Cheap meal at $5.  This stall is the winner of the hidden gems hawker award.  Closed Fridays.  Is this guy married?..cuz I'm in love...
A decent and enjoyable bowl of porridge. It's very smooth with the consistency of a thick soup. The meatballs and the lean meat were well seasoned. This will be perfect with a whole piece of youtiao!
"very comforting porridge! thick, flavourful, fresh ingredients and overall very tasty. in the words of my bf, ""Hen Kou Wei, Hen Xin Xian,best porridge i've ever eaten in my life"" "
"I had:
1. Century egg and lean meat porridge, with add on pork liver
2. Macaroni

Both are nice. The porridge is thick type."
Restaurant quality porridge at hawker centre prices.
Really best place for early morning breakfast.
"Very Delicious & Smooth of the congee
Freshly cooked with handmade meatballs and is very well.
Highly recommend of New world congee."
"I'd bought macaroni soup a couple of times from New World because my 4 yo loves it but today she asked for porridge and boy did you not disappoint. It was thick yet tasty with right amounts of everything (chicken, youtiao, shallots and even sesame oil). I would definitely try the other varieties and eat there with the additional egg, as so many reviewers have raved about it. Food aside, the people working there are very friendly and always smiling. Definitely a gem at the hawker centre."
"Ordered the century egg & lean meat porridge. Replace the lean meat with minced pork balls as i prefer pork balls to lean meat. Added an egg for extra shiokness. Love the cantonese congee. Saw alot of pple and kids eating the congee in food centre and their customers also included other races as well. Do try it if you are in the marine parade area. Comfort food on a rainy day. Will prefer more youtiao.. lol but i guess everything are expensive nowadays and the stall still manage to keep the price of the porridge at a reasonable price of $4/$5.

Edit: include photo of Jia Liao congee with more fried shallots in skater vacuum container."
Flavourful and tasty cantonese style porridge. A wide variety of choices available here too
"Really smooth, savoury and sweet congee. Porridge is tasty even when I felt so sick that day."
Yummy. Packet house and sick aunty. She loved it. Order $6. Really good. Warm up still good. He can try to blast freeze. I be first one to stock up.
Porridge is amazing! Noodles are delicious too:) always eat here and nvr get sick of the food here. Totally would recommend it
"Zhe Jian Dian Shi Wu Wei Dao Zhen Xin Hao Chi ,Se Wei Ju Jia,Lao Ban De Fu Wu Tai Du Zhen Hao,Qiang Lie Tui Jian "
"Delicious congee cooked by friendly chap. Understand from him, he will only source for the freshest ingredients to be used for his items.."
"This is the only place I think of when I am craving porridge. Great taste, generous ingredients, reasonable pricing and efficient one-man show!"
Super silky porridge of every mouthful bursting with flavor.
"Absolutely delicious! My family loves eating the congee, it is our comfort food. Do get the additional egg, it makes the porridge so much better. Very affordable for the amount of porridge you get. Nice and savoury, not too salty but not flavourless like some other congee. It is really filled with flavour. The fish porridge is a must.The owner is very nice as well, friendly young chap.

Do try it if you are around the marine parade hawker center!!!"
"Yummy, super tasty.. always craving for congee on rainy days! Perfect end to a busy evening :)"
"From a Cantonese background, we love our congee. This is the best congee I have had in Singapore and it's so close to our apt! My son loves the chicken and I like the sliced fish (there are no bones). It's very comparable to.our favorite place in NYC, enoodle in queens, so this is Def our home away from.home place. Ps my husband doesn't like congee but he will.share a bowl with my.son if it's from here."
"Honestly the best, not to be take away, you just savour the deliciousness in person! Always had the scallop with extra scallop and an raw egg on top! Once you mix this arrangement, it's definitely going to bring your tastebuds on amazing roller coaster ride! I've never tried the other generation's but I know that Apple doesn't fall off too far the tree!"
Smooth aromatic porridge in the east.worth the time travel to taste good class porridge.
"Good old comfort food with nolgastic taste. Friendly boss too.

Edit: Small intenstine also washed cleanly with no smell.. "
Like it! Good porridge for good price!
"Good food.
Reasonable price.
Tasty"
"Great Variety of porridge to choose from , ingredients are freshly prepared and also taste very delicious , definitely worth the trip"
"Quality have dropped dramatically within a month!!! The porridge now is extremely watery and the pieces of fried dough is utterly dry and still quite hard even after soaking inside the porridge after a period of time.

This 4th generation owner have utterly brought shame to the once famous hidden gem of the east porridge.

I will never come back again! Extremely disappointing experience..."
05/10 - I tried today and it didn't meet my expectations! First and last!!!
This place serves quite yummy porridge. I ordered the lean pork century egg porridge with an extra egg at $4.50...very nice!
"There's all kinds of Mee Siam out there, and you really won't know what you're getting till you order. When mine came, first thing I thought was--it's super red, probably the sour kind I don't like. But luckily, it wasn't. Turned out to be the sweet kind... though honestly, a bit too sweet. Only came with an egg and not much else. Not great, but okay lah--can eat."
"Had nasi campur ($6.50) for breakfast, was good especially the sambal sotong. I'll be back for more."
Nice lontong.
"Have been a regular patron ever since we moved to Woodlands in 1994.  Their food used to be authentic and good with complete generous portion.  But all went downhill when the original owners handover the stall to the current one.  From Mee Soto, Mee Rebus to Nasi Lemak, all taste very bland and they really stinge on basic ingredients.    Never have I been served Nasi Lemak without peanuts and ikan bilis.  And they cannot even make the Nasi right!  All mushy and uncooked (Malay say biji limau) nasi lemak for $4.  Really missed the good food from the previous owners."
"Ordered  mee soto via grab on 2nd april and it looks so bland. No spring onions and what not for garnish. It tasted bland.
Feels like the person who prepared this has no form of knowledge of what a mee soto is.
You just ruined my brekfast"
The male seller is very friendly and nice. Bought mee soto from the stall two times. The mee soto is very nice and have a lot of shredded chicken inside. $4 is very cheap and they even separate the noodle and soup for takeaways . The mee soto doesn't have any msg seasoning and doesn't make people feel thirsty after taking it.
"The food was very nice and yummy...especially the Nasi Goreng Ayam , Rendang Danging & Nasi Goreng Kampung"
"If there is zero star i will put zero star. Sadly i purchased 2 nasi lemak this morning 6 FEBRUARY 2025 at 7.30AM! 2 PACKETS COST ME $9. I PAID CASH! I DID NOT BEG THEM FOR FOOD! Very much DISAPPOINTED and ANGRY, the SAMBAL WAS SOUR AND SPOILT!!! THE RICE WAS STICKY!!! THE SMALL OMELETTE WAS STICKY ALSO!!! TRIED TO CALL THE NUMBER STATED AT GOOGLE BUT CANNOT GET THROUGH. PLEASE BECAREFUL PEOPLE!!! HOW CAN MALAYS DO THEIR BUSINESS LIKE THIS. ALLAAHU........"
"Edit for 2025:
Recently went and gave the fried rice another chance. There's a significant improvement to the quality. Have not tried the other dishes.

I'm glad the owners took the feedback and improved upon it!

OLD REVIEW BELOW:
Used to be a loyal patron of the shop since the early 2010s.

Previous stall owners were amazing cooks but sadly the new ones that took over have caused standards to drop significantly.

Used to be able to buy any dish from them and you'd be satisfied but now I can't say the same.

I've tried the Fried Rice, Mee Goreng and they weren't all that great compared to last time.

The final straw to me was their chicken rice which was disappointing.

I really want to support the stall. I guess I'll have to look elsewhere now"
"Used to be a regular and get their mee Soto, meesiam and nasi lemak with my parents but the food now is really bad.

Took away a mee Soto this morning and it was so salty, to the point I had to rinse my mouth because the saltiness lingered."
Take down the posting if no more selling asammm pedas
"Order take away Soto Ayam, only to discovered there's no chicken inside. Wonder if it a special treatment to non Muslim or all the while their Soto Ayam does not have chicken in it."
Had a very satisfying dinner with family.in sha allah will come backvery good customer service as well.
"sure will comeback, wont be the last time.!!"
"Alhamdullilah. The Asam Pedas taste so nice, ingredients blend perfectly well. Sure a come back and highly recommend to try."
The Asam Pedas is very delicious and we will come again.
"The Asam Pedas gravy itself was super nice. At first taste, you're gonna get hit with that sour flavour that gets your appetite going..It's not super spicy to be honest because that would just kill the flavour of the fish and this dish overall...Highly recommend!!!

Staff very friendly and humble.."
go to place for when i crave for kueh lopes or mee soto! usually order via Grab. packaging is neat & well packed. and instructions were always adhered to. thumbs up!

Great food & Great service
"Food is nice, Asam pedas stingray clay pot 
Friendly staff too. Affordable price"
Excellent malay food at a very reasonable price. Their nasi goreng ayam is a must try and my fav! Cooked fresh and on the spot! my go to place for my nasi goreng fix!
" For the previous owner/food
 For the new owner/food

Their previous menu like nasi lemak, nasi goreng, nasi ayam was so damn good. After passing down ownership isn't that good. But i thought its okay, things will improve in time. Who knows they changed they menu. Everything don't have, basically changed it to a nasi padang menu, even nasi ayam they no longer have it. Really disappointing. Wish the old owner comes back selling those delicious food."
"Staffs busy talking inside and not working. Dine in , takeaway or delivery service are SUPER SLOW.
4 staff standing inside kitchen chit chat and rude .""manager""also rude"
"Must try the Asam Pedas....Taste superb
Friendly staff.."
"Overall experience is from bad to worse. Use to be one of my favourite Malay store but after changing of new ownership, standard has drop a lot and yet prices also increase even more.

I order my food but the lady who was preparing my food  was using her phone, she can use until forgot to cook my food untill I went back to ask.

Order a Nasi Goreng Kampong, it came looking dark in colour for the rice as if the wok was not wash properly from previous cooking. The oil they use could be also very black/dark and never change.

Dish overall was oily and tasteless. No photos to share as I forgot to take it."
Nasi Goreng was super oily and black. The portion for $5 is way too little. Food for sale on the racks looks very unappetising. And they also forgot our order even though there were only 2 customers in line. The 2 ladies are always on their phone. Then standard has really dropped since new ownership.
Nasi lemak is the best . Tauhu goreng power . Mee goreng n nasi ayam sedappp . Nasi kerabu ayam berempah pon ada kt sini  . Air tangan orang kelantan original . Terbaik... tiap hari makan pun tak jelak / tak bosan . Highly recommended  . Uols Must come and try all menu there .
"Food here is delicious, been coming back here over and over again for the Nasi Lemak. Must try! "
Best food ever
Nice chicken rice. Not so dry. Good food
If at North area can come here. Not bad. Indian guy cook malay food quite good.
The best Nasi goreng by Chef Wan
Why delivery no chicken rice??
"Tasty, Quality and affordable food!
Love their chicken rice, signature nasi goring and ayam penyet set! Do try out their keropok also! Shiok!"
"Good decent food and I can't say more as I chance upon this shop around this area.
I tried the Nasi Sambal Goreng at first and it tasted good so I proceeded to order Nasi Goreng Ayam and Mee Goreng Seafood. It was good. So I had a good breakfast for the day.
What I heard is a new cook I believe the owner itself doing the dishes and I say it was great and hopefully this will be maintained as well.
My Nasi Sambal Goreng is with Rendang Daging, Sambal Paru and Begedil.
Oh yah, the Kakak serves me with smiles and entertain my request without making any fuss "
Nur restaurant serves the best Nasi Goreng I've ever had! Highly recommended!
"Very disappointed with food. Mee rebus was just the taucho taste nowhere close to a mee rebus taste. lontong was meh. epok2 potato which cost 80cents were spoiled, epok sardine was meh no onion what not. this is my first and last visit even though the service was fast."
Mid food but nice stall owners. $5 for fried rice and egg
Amazing Malay chicken rice! Mee soto was awesome too
Awesome nasi lemak that you eat in your childhood days.
Cb so expensive.
Becareful when using delivery for their food. They give u last year's rendang. Rubber wheels rendang
Love their delicious Lontong
Order mee rebus w/o beansprouts. The gravy no taste at all. No sambal added also. The colour of the gravy is totally different. Wont order from this place again. Regret. Please have a taste on your dishes before you serve to your customer.
"When I was there, there were 2 ladies running the stall. I ordered mee rebus and find it almost tasteless and bland even after I asked for extra sambal. Took them quite a while to get my new rebus even though there was no customer."
Recently we order 4 hum laksa. It's very nice and laksa grave amazing.
Variety of chicken rice & noodles for choices
"$5 for roasted chicken rice, additional $0.30 for takeaway box. Rice and chicken portion probably is suitable for under 12-years old, taste wise nothing to shout about. Buy only when you have to have halal-certified food, otherwise there are plenty of stalls around which offer better tasting food at bigger portions. Avoid."
good portion. very yummyy
"i was craving for chicken rice when i came across this stall. their food really made my day and I had no words, not because its bad. but because its SO SO delectable. i guess that it was fate that i stumbled across this lovely store "
"ok chicken rice made me question its name, i think that it should be renamed as delicious chicken rice instead."
"Have a mixed feeling to write this review. Chicken and rice are good. Price is on the higher side, whole chicken for $40, comparable with Boon Tong Kee (BTK) whole white boiled chicken at $38 (before GST). Paid $20 for half chicken. Packagings are good too.

Tried to ask for 2-3 packs more chilli, but staff said need to pay 10 cent per pack. Not much money indeed, but bit annoyed as BTK doesn't charge for extra chilli. Staff said boss instructed to charge for chilli.

After reaching office, surprised to find out that plastic spoons not given, I didn't notice plastic spoons too near the utensils there when I took few chilli sauce small plastic plate. Fortunately I still have some disposable plastic spoons in office."
Very amazing mayo cutlet chicken rice
First time trying this stall and was not disappointed. Colleague and I loved the chicken rice as you can tell from our plates haha  please do come and try for yourselves
"My all-time favourite chicken rice stall. Have recommended it to my friends & family and have only gotten good feedback. Chicken is tender and rice is fragrant, pls come and try for yourself."
"had chicken rice here a few days ago and was shocked at how good it was. contrary to its name, it's not just an ""ok"" chicken rice but an amazing one at that! go and try "
"amazing food, staff were friendly and helpful"
food was fabulous and staff were very nice
food was nice and served fast
Good service and great food
Love their chicken rice!!! Always order esp when I am chicken rice lover!
One of the best go to chicken rice. Frequently patronising this place!
Laksa was serve with no gravy I've not eaten this type of laksa in my life..very disappointed with the service..and I was also a membership and this is what I get..please do something about it..we are paying for the food and expect the food to be satisfied..the one who prepare the laksa is the Malay Aunty she was really blurr..
"The best Lakse I'ved ever eat, die punye rase memang best"
the food here is very nice and the staff here is very friendly !
"staff here are very nice,the chicken is tender and the quality of the food is 10/10 would come here everyday worth every cent"
Seeing menu porridge $2 ordered become $5.
Friendly staff and nicely packed food!
Recently visited this chicken rice stall and the chicken rice was one of the best I had eaten.
Best chicken rice I ever have. Love the rice and the chilli
"Good service, very friendly love the food especially the chicken rice!
Thumbs up! Guys"
If you want to enjoy good food then I think OK Chicken Rice HumFull LAKSA is  best 
Food portion is good. Staff is friendly and efficient.
Food is amazing here.
"I ordered their Prawn Laksa at 9pm through Foodpanda and the food was ready for pickup at 09.19pm , but fault is 100% on Foodpanda rider as rider was not collecting the food and remained uncontactable, even foodpanda customer service couldnt do much about it other than keep asking me to wait, being very frustrated i tried to contact the shop straight to inquire about my order and the person responded was extremely helpful and informed me that my order was already ready for quite some time but the rider was nowhere for pickup. I really love their laksa especially when its hot and i even ordered the friend wanton but unfortunately due to Foodpanda rider mistake, my food came cold and wanton was soggy. Hope next time i can enjoy the food from this shop properly. KUDOS to the responds from this stall."
1st time here. Food is good especially the prawn laksa..wow just amazing
The taste of the ingredients in the Laksa soup surpass my expectations. Not a drop of the soup was left in the bowl ....Amazing!! Will definitely come again
I come at 3.30am on a sunday morning and still open. Even recommend me dont take white chicken because put very long already. Recommend take roasted. Very good guy the person working night shift. I don't know his name but nice guy.
"Ordered from grab at 10.30 am on 4 Feb. Ordered curry chicken cutlet noodles with extra noodles, extra chicken, extra scoop of curry. The curry given in the extra bowl is not a scoop, barely 2 spoonfuls. Chicken given was roasted chicken breast? It's supposed to be chicken cutlet but I was not informed and was changed without knowing. Asked for cutlery but only gave plastic spoon, no chopsticks.

Ive ordered from this outlet number of times but today, made me question if its an oversight or staff thing because there was never really a problem previously."
Nice Food 
Spicy wantan char siew chicken noodle taste not really good cause noodles not blanch enough and Abit chewy and hard
love the white chicken amazing
Come to try humfull laksa. The taste is super awesome. My daughter eat till last gravvy. Super sedap. Need try guys.
So far it's one of the best chicken rice store that I've tried
"Recently visited this chicken rice stall and the chicken rice was one of the best I had eaten. Goes well with its hot nice soup and the chilli  is amazingly nice. Recommended 100%

5/5 "
"Delicious Chicken Rice!

5/5 stars

I recently visited OK Chicken Rice and ordered their signature chicken rice. The dish exceeded my expectations!

The chicken was cooked to perfection - tender, juicy, and flavorful. The rice was fragrant and fluffy, with just the right amount of oil and seasoning. The chili sauce added a nice kick without overpowering the other flavors.

The portion was generous, and the price was very reasonable. The service was also friendly and attentive.

Overall, I highly recommend this for their mouth-watering chicken rice. I'll definitely be back for more!

*Tips:*

- Try the chili sauce - it's a game-changer!
- Order the combination plate for a sampling of their other dishes."
"Food were damn nice, good portion and always buy..."
"It's an experience, very good food and friendly staffs"
roast chicken rice delicious.
"Ordered prawn laksa
Delicious yum yum"
"The Humfull laksa was perfect compared to another outlet, a little salty to my taste. Went many times to this Marsiling outlet and served with consistent servings of laksa, wanton noodles and chicken rice.
4* for service and atmosphere due to the lack of enough manpower. Give the guys sufficient time and you'll get a good serving of food."
"Order chicken laksa , wow hot n nice"
Chicken was red (slightly undercooked). Chilli is not bad . Paid 30c for soup takeaway but didn't give me the soup (missed it out). One staff at 5am with so many orders . Only halal chicken rice in the estate but needs a lot of improvement .
chicken was aromatic and tasty
i waited 18 minutes for my food and also they enter the wrong order and end up i had to pay extra. All this while i eat here has no problem only today is the first encounter of such problems.
Appreciate the owner
"Just Edible
Rice no taste
Roast Chicken Normal
Chilli very bad

Ratings does not match the Quality"
Its delicious and worth it
The food is amazing. Willing to eat Ok Chicken Rice most of the time. Totally worth it.
Amazing food
Excellent experience
"I love the fact that they serve laksa and chicken in the same stall.... a surprisingly rare combo as most laksa places only give prawns and most chicken rice places only have curry chicken noodles.

The chicken has probably got to be the highlight of the meal. The rice and laksa were both ok and served as adequate compliments to the chicken. Would definitely indulge in this mini craving of mine if I ever happen to be in the area."
Good offer and nice food
"My go to order is always roasted chicken breast. It is served quick by the stuff, the breast meat sometimes they give more, sometimes they give lesser, sometimes larger, sometimes smaller. Hope the amount of meat given can be more consistent. The best part to me is their chilli. Also I love their cucumber. It is not just a regular cucumber from a chicken rice stall but it comes with a pinch of marinated sourness which makes the meal more appetizing!"
"Chicken rice taste average, and somewhat feels shortchanged. Falls short of expectations and charges more for selecting chicken thighs. Will try others, as there's much better chicken rice store, a short walk away."
Solid Chicken Rice 
"everybody please don't want order food delivery here, just order chicken rice 1 packet, waiting 1 hour more "
Tried their laksa very yummy
"Nice food and reasonable price, worth the portion and service given."
so far i suggest at here..so good and want to repeat again next time...better combine with chicken rice
"chicken laksa xtra,just want to eat untill finish..superb nice plus fresh hum"
"try the roasted chicken rice, it was perfect! totally recommended!"
Beautiful and tasty bubur. I ask for roast drumstick add steam chiken bubur! So nice!!
Nice stall with super fragrance chicken rice. The chicken is so tender and definitely will come back for more.... Great service too!!!!
"Zhe Xi Fan Hen Hao Chi, Bu Hui Xian, You Zha De Cong Tou He Cong Pei "
nice food.. delicious.. can try laksa and the chicken porridge .. chicken also nice..
"Today i come jurong oulet i request roast wing debond you all see unspected portion like this ,.It was really delicious.Its full of flavours ,the spices , the juicy from chicken ,"
The sado chicken chopper is very friendly..including the other staff too..and they are very patient.
"Chicken rice and all the food here is really delicious, crazy power. The price is ok, the food is powerful. I often buy here because it tastes so good. Highly recommended, you can't lose eating here....Well done!!"
So far all the food we tried taste gd and value for $
Power Food
The chicken rice is just average and extra payment is required for extra chili.
"Around 40 minutes need to wait to get my chicken meatball noodles..... understood if there is a lot of customer queuing, but this particular hour, I don't see a crowded queue.... Until I ask for how long I need to wait for my food..... I had also a argument with the worker also as they are rushing to complete my meal however they forgot to serve the chicken slices inside my meal and told me that there is no chicken included in the menu... until a guy came and told me that they mistake forgot to put the chicken slice in my meal...

I am not angry because of the food, just time being wasted for me.

I had attached some photo with Time for reference"
Tasty and plus points for being open 24/7!
"Back then we like to order from this stall for chicken rice and their porridge, sadly lately been 3 times now, theor porridge are getting lesser and lesser. From almost to tip full now is 1/3 of full of the bowl. Won't be purchasing with them any further. You want to reduce the porridge, next time reduce the price too ."
Had tried almost all the items in their menu. All agreeable to my taste and delicious. Love the Laksa
Poor service. Delay my order twice. Wait 1 hr plus for chicken rice ? Dissapointing.
"Why overall i am giving only 3 stars....Chicken is soft and nice, rice i only can rate medium cos not fragrant enough and best is the chilli, damn shiok.... Now the price is on high side as this is coffee shop not restaurants.. Order chicken thigh with rice at a price of $8.50....Normally in any chicken rice stall even famous chicken rice stall is $6.50...."
"Title: Outrageous Pricing and Disappointing Service at Ok chicken Rice Marsiling Outlet

This afternoon, my wife visited the Marsiling outlet and ordered one Hum Laksa and a Drumstick Chicken Rice. The total came to a staggering $14.10! She was absolutely shocked by the price--especially when we saw that the description of the item was just ""XXL Thigh.""

How on earth did they come up with such an absurd price for something from a coffee shop stall? $8.50 for a simple drumstick chicken rice, and that doesn't even include the soup--yes, there's an additional charge for that too! Are you kidding me? This is outright daylight robbery!

To say we're disappointed is an understatement. Charging these kinds of prices for basic coffee shop food is outrageous and frankly insulting to customers. What a rip-off!"
"Good food, good service. I've been eating here for 4 months already "
nice to eat
the food very nice
One of the best places to taste singapore meals
Roasted chicken rice was good and well-priced. Free soup you dispense on your own.
"I bought the laksa based on its good reviews on Google, but when I got home, there was a thick layer of oil floating on top of the gravy. I ended up discarding the oil, and to my disappointment, there were no cockles included and the taste was just so-so. On the bright side, the stall staff were polite."
Laksa and chicken rice taste ok. Not fantastic
The Lemon Chicken Cutlet Rice is perfect for that fried chicken crunch and savoury lemon zest taste that enhances the fragrance level of the typical chicken rice that most people would recognise. Other items as great as this can be found in their menu of both chicken rice and laksa.
Very friendly staffs!
"Always love their chicken rice.
Delicious and reasonable price."
"I can't express how grateful I am for the boneless chicken curry noodle from this place. After suffering a full week of flu and losing my taste buds, I was desperate for something that could fill me up and provide some comfort.

And their Boneless Chicken Curry Noodle dish was an absolute lifesaver! The texture and warmth of the curry noodles were incredibly soothing. The boneless chicken was easy to eat even when I wasn't feeling my best.

Thank you for providing such a comforting and delicious meal during a tough time. Highly recommend to anyone in need of a hearty and satisfying dish!"
"We felt that the laksa was nicer than chicken rice - but to each their own. Overall, chicken  was juicy, even in the chicken meatball form. Would recommend to patronise this stall if you're in the vicinity for decent chicken rice :) Oh!! There's free flow soup too!"
"24hours stall !! Feeling hungry in the midnight and went to eat their cutlet noodle. The noodle is very good n the cutlet is crispy enough.

Heard their laksa is not bad , will try it next time"
"If you're craving laksa or chicken rice and in the area, worth dropping by. A lot of sides to choose from as well"
Nice laksa soup but low value as $5 gets you quite a small bowl with around 3 cockles. Not filling.
Staff are friendly. Fast in handling orders .
"do not be mislead by the reviews, as they give benefit for 5 star review given. dont feel the taste and service deserve the 4+ review"
Laksa was nice and quantity is alot
The Best Chicken Rice In Town...5 
"If you're looking for generous portions and affordable local meals, this place is a must-try! They offer authentic, award-winning Chinese food that's halal certified.

The chicken rice has a big portion of tightly packed rice and lots of chicken. Don't be shy to get some soup for the side.

The laksa noodles are rich and flavorful, not diluted with real coconut milk. You can customize your bowl by choosing from the menu, picking your noodles and adding toppings.

The chicken cutlet noodles come in a huge portion with mildly spicy, crispy cutlet.

The fried wantons are crispy without any unpleasant smell or tendons, great with mayonnaise but would be even better with chili sauce."
"Taste the same as their hougang outlet which is good. Service also good, I was buying drink and the tall malay brother was setting up the plate and added chilli and soup without asking me.

Good service for that. Really appreciate him doing it."
The food is awesome...laksa very marvelous ..must try...
"Savor the delights of this halal-certified chicken rice chain, where the rice boasts a fluffy texture that's just right. The chili packs a spicy punch, perfectly complementing the savory dishes. Offering rice, porridge, laksa, and curry, this establishment delivers an authentic culinary journey for all to enjoy."
"It was a great meal with friends and family. I really liked the food there especially the bowl of humfull laksa. The laksa was creamy and not too spicy for those who can't take spice. The ingredients were generous and overall, it was a scrumptious meal. The chicken rice was decent and aromatic. The chicken was very tender and juicy and i really liked it. I would totally come back again if i'm around that area."
"We ordered the half chicken ($20) & the humfull laksa ($5). I would highly recommend the humfull laksa as the hum was bigger than I expected and it was a decent and yummy bowl of laksa. I also ordered the fried wanton skin ($3 for 6) it was pretty good however it was quite flat and didn't have much filling inside of it. The chicken rice was decent and it was worth a try if you live nearby. Overall, it was a great meal with family and i would go for it again if i'm around that area!!"
Recommended. The food is good and the sauce have a very special taste different from usual.
"This OK Chicken,  really let customers disappointed ?  Since you'll open until now, only take order ! Yesterday we have ordered you'll things,  but my daughter want Chicken Porridge,, you'll give us her Chicken Rice,?. Got a few times,, I. asking Got ( Curry Mee,Laksa)? Since you put the pictures, Why's no laksa & Curry Mee!. No wonder when I pass-by,   you'll very  free
(Zhe Yang De Tai Du Hen Hao,Hen Kong Xian!Zhe Jiao Zuo Guan Men Da Ji!).. This type of service you'll want. Customers to give this stall (5 stars)
.Understand what I'm Writing about.."
"Grossly overpriced
Laksa with steam chicken thigh = $9 (a roast duck drumstick cost cheaper)
Add 20g hum = 5pcs (slightly bigger than 10c coin) = $2.50 (hum in Singapore more expensive than oyster!)

Taste: Average"
"A Humful place... came here to get ""Sa"" by the Laksa... "
"Very average chicken rice and laksa. Chilli was spicy and good. Got the roasted chicken breast and quantity was decent for $5, but meat was dry and flavourless without the soy sauce and chili. Laksa was oily and coconut flavour was too strong - resulting in a bland and overly rich gravy with no spicy kick. Hum was big but that's all this laksa has going for it."
Overall great experience as a repeat customer. I was served quickly and food are consistent.
"Generous portions, delicious steamed Drumstick Rice with pickled cucumber and flavorful chili sauce. Also, there is free-flow soup.Recommend!"
Can never go wrong with Chicken Rice Ok!
Food's great! Loving the chicken rice! Me & my husband keeps coming back coz its really damn good! The kitchen crew are kind & friendly too!
"One of the best hum laksa places I've eaten at. The wantan mee is also really good and the chicken rice, chicken was done nicely and the rice was fragrant. Portion wise, I eat a lot so these three just nice for me (otherwise, the portion is close to a normal medium size according to my GF) Thank you to the staff that was serving me. Highly recommend!"
My friend & I had our lunch over at OkChickenRice & Humfullprawlaksa. It was my first time trying their food & overall it taste so good especially the chicken laksa! Love it! The fried chicken skin was soo good too! It's big & very cripsy!! The staff was friendly & they gave me recommendations for me to try! Very accessible & nearby bus stop! Will definitely recommend to my family & friends!
"I am a Chicken Rice lover. How could I not noticed this brand which has many branches across the island.
Friend gave a treat and highly recommended the Roast Chicken so gave it a try even though my preference is White. I still prefer traditional White Chicken Rice. For me every thing that goes into that plate of chicken rice is important; RIce, Chicken and Chilli & Veg. I was rather surprised and impressed that the Roast Chicken Skin have a special taste. White Chicken was above average, The rice was fluffy and not oily the way I like it. Chilli was acceptable though I would prefer it to be thicker. Most chicken rice chilli nowadays tend to be watery.
This would be one of those hawker food that I would remember and want to go back again."
The food is delicious and the staff are all friendly.
"Succulent chicken cut into bite-size pieces. Served with fragrant rice along with some light soy sauce and chili sauce. Also added on the Fatbulous cutlet and vegetables side to enjoy.

Laksa - the appetizing fragrance of the gravy wrapped over the thick bee hoon, yummylicious. Open 24 hours, do drop them a visit!"
"a halal certified dual food stall that has many outlets! went to try the outlet at marsiling and was not packed. Their ingredients are fresh and especially their meatball are handmade 

  ($6.50)
the broth has a decent taste, it was not too thick and not too spicy! the ingredients are quite decent, there were fishcake, eggs,,tofu puff and the prawns were fresh! overall is quite decent! 
8/10

   ($5)
the chicken was tender and quite decent. the rice was fragrant and not very oily unlike some stalls, overall will say is not bad!
7/10

   ($5)
this is one of their recommended item. the chicken meatball is quite unique! it was crispy and quite flavourful! the noodles were very qq and flavourful but the only downside is that it was quite dry 
8/10

  ($7)
the chicken was tender and flavorful, the skin i would say is crispy but not crispy enough for my liking  maybe i should have ordered their fatbulous chicken skin option instead which might have been crispier  i wouldn't say is a bad dish but $7 i would say is quite pricey 
6/10"
Taste is good but I rather the rice portion be more like 1 and a half bowl instead of 1 bowl
Food was delicious and one of my favourite choice is the 6 Handmade Chicken Meatballs!  do drop by and give it a try! 
My husband and I came down here for supper and had a fantastic experience at this outlet! (Open 24hrs) The food was delicious and well prepared! My personal favorite has to be the prawn laksa. I highly recommend this place especially to those looking to satisfy their late-night cravings!
I visited Ok Chicken Rice & Humfull Laksa at Marsiling on the 15th of February 2024 together with my family. We had a really great experience with them as staff were really friendly and helpful. We'd usually order in for the laksa & chicken rice & this is our first time dining in there. Food is delicious and we recommend you to dine-in there as well to devour their laksa & chicken rice! We'll come back again soon :)
Loved the extra hum in the laksa and the smooth steamed chicken. Free-flow soup was a nice bonus. Friendly staff and delicious food. 
Very nice chicken rice and its open 24 hours. The chilli and cucumber very tasty!
"Big portion of rice. Chilli and cucumber very nice! Best part is its open 24 Hr, so even when im hingry at 2-3, am, i can come down to the stall and get my favourite chicken rice."
Cost me $5 and the portion is so small and thin. Size of a primary school chicken rice.
"  
Meat is very tender and love the roasted skin! Matched with fragrant rice and perfect with the chilli and dark soy sauce. Addon is available with Braised Egg, Tofu and Veggies for just only $3.

 
Laksa sauce is very rich, flavourful and not too spicy at all. The amount of ingredients is very generous too. They have other non-hum laksa options too, prawn or chicken laksa.

  
Love the meatball tastes flavourful and slightly juicy inside. Ordered for my girl and she loves it!

 
The wanton skin is very crispy. So addictive that we finish up the wantons fast!

Quite a long wait during peak hour though. Other than that it is quite a pleasant dining. Will be back to try their other dishes."
Best best best !!!
Not wearing glove and mask when preparing food asked my order need how long he say cannot ask and challanage for a fight how can a buniness hire sure a bararian to work in a stall that serves decilous chicken rice but the staff is totally rude @nea @sfa food handlers must wear mask and glove at all times
They have a great variety of dishes to choose from. Portions are generous too. My kids enjoyed their chicken rice and I loved the humfull prawn laksa. Will definitely go back again.
"Love the food! My family too.
Portion was generous, the hum in the laksa don't have fishy smell. The chicken cutlet is very crispy."
"Had sudden crave for chicken rice and came across this store at marsiling, 1 ordered a plate of roast chicken rice and my friend ordered laksa. Decent store with enough portion and taste good for both laksa and chicken rice."
"The steamed chicken is really soft and tender, eat it with the chilli and rice is such a good combination. They are also selling Laksa, taste is ok for me, if you like dried shrimp kind, can give it a try."
"Food was well worth the money with superior quality and taste, the staff was also friendly and welcoming in terms of introduction of the food available

I'll definitely be back for more!"
"I enjoyed the roasted chicken rice, meat is tender. Will be back to try other food!"
"Placed an order thru grab ard 8pm and we're a street away. (Time edit)

Food actually came earlier than I had expected but was disappointed as the porridge was cold. 
I had wanted to eat a hot or at least warm porridge due to a toothache.

Nevertheless, credits shld be given to that Laksa...delicious!

Thank you!"
"We ordered a feast for three. Their chicken was tender and well-marinated. We enjoyed their chicken cutlet too which was crispy yet not too oily! Xiao Bai Chye was fresh too and we love how they added fried shallots on top of it which added flavours to the veggie.

If you love hums (cockles), do get their hum laksa which comes with a generous amount of fresh and big hums. They also have other laksas too for people who don't fancy hums!"
"I ate laksa...as they named humfull but I could say harmful....5 small cockles...cili is bland and the paste is like in bottle paste....not original and lousy....laksa noodles and 2 piece of slice fish cake and half cut of hardboil egg

Price would fetch like 2.50 for just that meagre bowl.... I was charged for $5

Will never come again...."
Reasonably priced and one of the best chicken rice I have tasted! Highly recommended!
Tried their roasted chicken rice set. Halal as well... their chilli power... awesome!
Food is excellent with lots of hums
Nice stall with super fragrance chicken rice. The chicken is so tender and definitely will come back for more.... Great service too!!!!
"Find their single item such as laksa and chicken rice on menu affordable but half chicken price is on the steeper side at $20, used to be $15 but i guess inflation hit hard."
"This is my 3rd time here.

I tried both their hum laksa and chicken rice.

Awesome la....

"
"Relatively good chicken rice, ordered delivery a couple of times too. Standard remain consistent. I prefer their wanton noodles over their chicken rice but chicken portion can be bigger. Good fried wantons. Halal!"
"Came here as i was craving. Tried it. Awesome food! Super super great service! Super friendly. Definitely will come again. Recommended 

WanLing"

"Delicious chicken rice with abundance of other dishes too! Always bought steam chicken rice and laksa takeout to eat with my family! The staffs are very friendly, food portion is generous, food quality is sedap also! Most important! Affordable!

Due to the popularity of the food, queue may be long during peak hours but it's worth the little wait! Do give them a try, you'll be back for more! Confirm! "
Ordered steamed chicken rice with chicken thigh which was charged additional. Ended up being given chicken breast and the staff lied to be that it is chicken thigh. Don't recommend this place.
"Quality of food is decent, however it's extrmely inconsistent at grabfood. Ordered same ""chicken leg curry rice"". 1st day meal came with a full drumstick, thigh, and de-boned mid wing with 1 whole egg cut into 2. Also came with white rice.

2nd time came with the same chicken leg, but no mid wing and no egg. And it came with ""chicken rice"" instead of white rice.

Inconsistency is crazy."
Too much bone always.. rice is fragrant tho
Chicken is tender. Curry is flavourful and can be quite spicy for customers who can't take spicy food. Overall is good.
Best 24hr nasi ayam ever Recommended by Joy
The food is delicious and nice! Also It's 24 hours!
"I just take away wanton mee, the mee very soft until cut small small like porridge. chicken and wanton ok , if don't know how to cook wanton mee don't sell made customer dissanpointed. This first time and last time patronise this stall.

Cut cut means the mie not long like break break . If Marsiling didn't sell wanton mee how come they sold to me?"
Power ahh nasi ayam! 
One of the best chicken rice in Singapore!

"Good job for the chicken rice, porridge and noodles so far!
Just that the porridge and curry can be a little too salty, so watch out for the seasoning!"
"Kudos to this stall for doing a meal deal for the community on Labour Day. But it seems like they might have compromised on the taste of the food and are unable to keep up with the demand.

3 Stars for the above average Chicken Rice and meat was also tender

But the Laksa was terribly disappointing Taste was lackluster and not flavourful. Seems to be missing something. Really not worth the long wait though the standard may have dropped due to the promo.

Hope they will improve."
"Loves to give wrong order. Can avoid grabfooding from here, stall lives up to it's name, caz the chicken rice is ok only."
"I have been partrinising the stall at Marsiling since it's opening this year 2023 and always had a pleasant experience. The food is great, the service is always consistent and staff are always very welcoming. Make sure you sign up as member and enjoy the deals and discounts"
"Chicken rice $4 is good. Will go back again.
Though the prawn laksa $6 may look very oily but actually taste pretty good and weirdly doesn't taste oily also that I actually drank the soup without caring the amount of the oil from the looks of it.

Service is good from the male staff, he bothered to let me know waiting time is 10mins because alot of orders. Usually 10-20min waiting time people don't bother to report one. Always believed in food that comes from good customer service."
Tasty chicken rice!
"Delicious laksa. Not too sweet, not too spicy. Perfect for my taste buds. One very unique characteristic of this stall is it is open for 24 hours. And you will be surprised even at 3 AM there are people eating this tasty laksa that comes with cockles and shrimps. Only problem is the place can be quite humid in the daytime."
Very well prepared food and delicious prawn and hum laksa and affordable pricing
"Friendly staff and great food at great prices.

My go to chicken rice now for any chicken rice cravings."
"Basically I was around the area and heard that there is a newly open chicken rice stall and went to try , my reaction was wow the steam chicken was really nice and tender the staff was nice and friendly I will give it a  and will recommend it to my friends service by Yusof"
"The steam chicken is tender and yummy too.
Aiman"
"Bad experience. There was no proper queue system - the cashier was at the noodle side, so I joined the 'queue' at that side. Turned out, the uncle in front of me had already ordered and was just waiting to collect his food. Another customer cut my queue by going in front of the uncle.

Ordered laksa but forgot to inform the lady I wanted yellow noodle instead of thick bee hoon. She told me to say earlier, I apologised and said I forgot just now. She still went ahead to say later the cook see the order on the system and cook wrongly how? If can, just say can; if cannot, just say cannot. Turned out, she was the one preparing it.

Laksa gravy was very salty. Ingredients were not fresh - sea hum were rubbery, fish cake had a weird taste (smelled like the rag cleaners used to clean tables at coffeeshops) and the texture of the egg was a tell-tale sign that it was not fresh - it was not firm and bouncy when I sank my teeth into it. I also hate it when I saw the rotten roots of taugeh in my laksa! First try and last try. Didn't finish the food."
"2nd branch I have been to. This is Marsiling branch.

Awesome food and vendor, good chicken rice.
Chilli was not what I remembered, from the previous branch in Block 325 Woodlands. Preferred the old chilli.

Yusof's service is awesome, highly recommend."

One of the best fruit rojaks in sg
Aunty fierce but the food is nice 
"Poh Piah wrapping abit loose, but taste quite good.
Rojak to me some what average lower abit.."
"Rojak was soggy and wet. You tiao & daopok was soggy too. Sauce was super sour. I ate 10% and threw the rest away.

I saw other good reviews and photos looks good. Maybe I am just unlucky.

Will never go back again."
"The rojak is nice. All the ingredients are fresh and the prawn paste mixture is fragrant and not overly sweet.
The popiah is okay only. The sweet sauce used here has a peculiar taste."
"this Rojak stall is located inside Kampung admiralty. Best Rojak Ever!!!, Surprising no much ppl review it. Try it and you will never eat other Rujak stall like what I do."
Rojak was fresh and juicy.
Ordered the fruit rojak and the portion was big. The fruits were fresh and the taste was good. The service of the staff was good too.
Nice and decent rojak with option to add youtiao for $1
This vegetarian stall looks healthy and having great dishes for us to choose from. Will find a day definitely gotta try out.:)
The food shown in the banner and what we actually received looked nothing alike. Very unexpected. Didn't taste that good also.
"Good to be eating healthy.
Great food.Roasted vegetables."
"Clean, fresh and tasty. A very good vegetarian salad stall. I really like their roasted veggies and sesame tofu."
Very yummy
"The sesame tofu brown rice tastes good. Comes with broccoli  n carrot  too.
I added the 2 fafalel balls n they r yummy too!...
Also tried the tapioca kueh, tasted good too.
Opens 930am - 8pm daily.
Egg is whole egg.
The staff said the rest of the foods NO alliums/ eggs."
"Tried the Veggie Wrap, taste good. @$2.90 is a healthy snack. Can't wait to try other salads."
"Tried Old Hup Kee at Parkway Parade koptiam and was really impressed by the taste of the dishes. The fried kway teow had a strong wok hei flavour -- super fragrant and now one of my favourites. The yuan yang carrot cake was well cooked with a great mix of crispy and soft textures, perfect for sharing. I also enjoyed the Hokkien mee, which was flavourful and not too oily, and the fried oyster had a nice batter with plump oysters. Definitely a place I'll return to when I'm craving hearty hawker food!"
Great spot for classic hawker fare in a clean and comfy food court. The Hokkien Mee and Char Kway Teow had strong wok hey and came loaded with ingredients -- including see ham! Fried Oyster Omelette was a highlight with the perfect mix of crisp and juicy. Convenient location at Marine Parade. Worth a visit!
"That char kway teow was awesome. Everything about it was good, from how it looked to how it tasted, the texture, the ingredients, and how fresh it was."
Best hokkien mee in vivo. The prawn is big and fresh. Generous amount. Love it . The chill is spicy and really match the hokkien mee.  My daily food for now.
"One critical way of testing the quality of local signatures is to get them delivered and see if they survive. Most fail arriving mushy or worse. We are very pleased to discover for ourselves that Old Hup Kee Marine Parade passed. Congrats to us we now have a new fav this side of east coast. The Hokkien mee came al dente, not mushy, well fried, satisfying texture, quite shiok with light umami, no wok hei, some pork lard, enough ingredients and 2 nice meaty prawns. Don't compare and compete with other famous HKM. This one holds its own and is very decent. Got this around here we are happy liao. Taste good 3 ways, bare, lime-in and with chili. Nice chilli sauce some more. The orh luak also shiok. Nice plump juicy oysters with well fried fragrant eggs with minimal starchy bits. Perfect ratio. The fried carrot cake both white and black also shiok. We are happy. Thank you.

Back again to try the char kway teow. You know it's wok fried for sure when you open the cover. Won't win any awards but it's certainly more than decent. It's more dark soy than sweet. Cockles are tiny but I fixed that with an order of oyster omelette. Plump stuff. Good mix. Nice tangy chilli sauce. Shiok.

Testing their consistency. Ordered Hokkien mee again. This time very little prawn stock umami and never give lime. The chilli kinda saved it. As for their fried beehoon, it's just char kway teow using only thick beehoon that's all. Decent."
"Service was good - fast and responsive

Hokkien mee - abit hard, salty and burnt bitter
Fried oyster - crispy but why so salty ????

Will give it a try again when it's different chef"
"Food is good and service crew is friendly, but I had diarrhoea after consuming the food. Not sure how is the cleanliness of the food."
Worth trying. Chili spicy and nice.
Come come eat eat
"Excellent Service, Fantastic Food, Great Atmosphere"
"Tried the yuan yang carrot cake, both black and white versions. The white carrot cake is flavorful with a nice wok hei and eggy aroma, while the black one leans sweet and is a bit on the oily side. Also had the Singapore-style fried Hokkien mee. It was salty and overall tasted average."
"Absolutely loved their black carrot cake  the flavor is so rich, you can really taste the eggs in it. Definitely coming back for more!"
"Had the Hokkien Mee and one of the carrot cake dishes, both were great!"
Requested for an additional egg to go with my CKT. Nice char. Nice flavour. Not overly sweet or salty. Perfect balance to my liking. 10% discount if you're paying using NTUC app. I think the price is quite reasonable.
"Happened to chance upon the boss himself cooking the hokkien mee. Freshly made and prepared. Reasonably priced for Aircon food court inside parkway parade. Prawns are very fresh and huge serving. Must add on their special chilli, adds a special kick to the hokkien mee."
"Good food, hokkien mee is good"
"Food taste nice, recommend!"
Food was good
Good food at an affordable price
"used to miss KL Hokkien from KL, but now I found my replacement. Not quite the same -is my preferred dish now.  this stall us my place to go, to get some delicious SG Hokkien mee!"
Very unhygienic stall. Saw man with runny nose blowing and wiping nose hard with tissue at the wok ... threw the soiled tissue at the cook area ...and then turned around to get the noodles with his dirty hands and continued frying and serving..... threw away my noodles.. never again! 
Very nice food
Staff is very friendly and nice!
V nice hokkien mee and attitude v good!
"Great wok hei
Fresh ingredients
Plateful"
"Very nice
service fast and good
would come again"
Good Hokkien mee although dishes are lacking
"Tried this place based on Google reviews and regretted it.

The HKM tasted awful, and the CKT was overly sweet. Cockles were barely present and smaller than 5-cent coins. Despite the small portions, we couldn't even finish the food. It was a total disappointment.

Noticed a sticker on their stall offering a free plate of carrot cake in exchange for good Google reviews. Seems questionable--shouldn't this be against policy?"
food is yummy and vendor is friendly!
good plate of char kway teow with strong work hey and a good portion for its price. Definitely would see myself coming back here again
Nice carrot cake
Authentic fried oyster. Love it!
"Taste so good, muay try"
Nice carrot cake
Noodles is very tasty... the chilli is power... please come support this store. They have a set at $9.90 which is very value for money.
Nice Char Kuey Tiao n carrot cake. Alot of work hey
Fast and quick to get your food!
Great food !
Good food good service
"Black carrot cake tastes blacker than the soles of my best friends feet. Salty, moist and crispy. 6/6"
"Went to buy because of the good reviews , but when I ordered the 9.50 portion he gave very little, which is the same as the 7.50 portion and insisted he is correct."
Ordered the hokkien mee to have it inhouse. I can say the taste is great. Will come bk again
"Whenever I go VivoCity, I always eat fried oyster from this shop. Not so oily, Oyster is fresh and big. The taste is always the same and amazing."
Staff was friendly and welcoming
V nice and highly recommended
Really good food at affordable pricing! Would reccomend anyone to come again:)
delicious food and great service. the $9.90 promo is very worth!
Food is tasty and awesome. Stall owners friendly
Food was nice and service was good
Sibeh hojiak favourite food since young
Great food !
Awesome local food
"The cashier's service is excellent but the chef is a bit grumpy. I had the Hokkien mee and carrot cake for only $9.90. They are simply scrumptious.  The Hokkien mee is cooked just right and they are quite generous with eggs in the carrot cake. I would have preferred more wok hei, though I did enjoy my meal. The chili that comes with the Hokkien mee is delicious but very hot which delighted my tastebuds."
"Value promotion for the carrot cake which was decent. However, the Hokkien mee was lackluster. No wok hei taste, and very average at best. Prawns were quite small."
Excellent food and service. Great people and taste overall
I like the food it smell delicious
The food is delicious
"Very delicious hokien me ,"
Great meal and fast service. Ordered oyster omelette
Great taste and fast service
"My Favorite Kway Teow in Vivo!! Very good and nice, they give generous portion too :)"
Good to try
Good and tasty will come back again
Yummy and nice
"Tasty Hokkien Mee, will come again!"
Very delicious 
"Fairly bland hokkien mee with small amounts of ingredient.

Spicy chilli but no fragrance to it.

Quite pricey at 9.50 and definitely can do with a lot more prawn flavor to it. Its very bland and tastes like it has been fried with just very little seasoning and broth. The broth they used definitely need a lot more power up because when I see the guy fries it, he did put quite a bit of broth into the frying.

Noodles are okay in consistency. And wet enough for it to look good."
A wonderful meal. FCC is good and FKT best of all.
Very good service and food taste yummy
Food is great
damn solid la 
Good to tryo(^V^)o
This is definitely worth the wait and queue.. Ask for more dark sauce n more spicy.. Shiok.. Uncle super friendly..
Food looks fantastic
Food is delicious. I love their fried kway teow. Will try again next visit.
Friendly staff. Wide variety of options
"Very fast, food very delicious, staff very nice"

Have been patronising this stall ever since I saw it opened! And it's one of the best Hokkien mee and charkwayteow and black carrot cake! Standard never drop. And it's better than the outlet at Jurong East!
"Staff Very nice
Cooking very fast!"
Great offer good service!
"I shun food courts that sell non authentic local dishes. Happen to be at Vivo city food court on a weekend. Decided to try small size HKM $7.50. Their chilli packs a punch, one of the best chilli so far.
Noodle portion is ok considering it's at a mall food court. Noodles has a nice semi wet consistency. Would prefer this dish to be fried w thin beehoon instead. Taste can be improved with more umami and fresher prawns. If you crave hokkein noodles but not at a market hawker location, this one can try and support."
"staffHen nice,Shi Wu Ye Bu Cuo "
Service was good and the server was really friendly!!
Very good taste and service by the crew.
"Very friendly, great service and great food"
First try of the char kuey tiow here. Taste nice
Good hokkien noodle.

Nice food and friendly boss. Enjoy the meals!
We went for the $9.90 fave deal for a Yuan Yang Carrot Cake and Fried Hokkien Mee. Both are yummy and nice! They also gave crispy pork lard. And very friendly customer service too! :-)

Did it for free carrot cake :D
Friendly service! Nice wok hey smell
good good good
"Delicious comfort food here , friendly staffs at Vivo . 2 plates for $9.90 quite worth. Thumbs up."
The Fried Hokkien Mee was delicious. The sauce was suitably starchy and fragrant without being too runny. The sambal had the right amount of tartness to provide zest to the dish. The Fried Carrot Cake (white) had a good amount of egg but lacked garlic and  preserved radish (cai po)
Tasty carrot cake with wok hei! Taste good.
Tasty food! Has ongoing promo hokkien mee and carrot cake combo for $9.90!
Good Service and tasty food.
Hokkien mee is good. $9.90 for both hokkien mee and carrot cake 
"The noodles are super delicious and the chili is a balance of spiciness and taste. It's a food court, don't expect much of an atmosphere. The staff was patient and recommended the serving."
Good customer service.

Enjoyed a lot"
Good food and service! :) Come and support!
Appetising and delicious
"Check out this food stall offering a fantastic $9.90 promo for two items: carrot cake and fried Hokkien mee. The carrot cake is particularly delightful, with a perfect balance of flavors and a satisfying texture.
This combo deal a must-try for anyone craving hearty and flavorful food.
Portions were generous, promo price is reasonable, and the stall owners were friendly and efficient."
"Nice hokkien mee and fried kway teow.
Yummy food :)"
Very good and cheap
"Good taste, fast service and value for money "
Always coming back for the black carrot cake & char kwey teow!
Polite staff who helped to promote dishes that they serve. Food is also good with enough wok hey. Chilli has enough kick. Would recommend to check out outlet at vivocity basement kopitiam

Very nice staff !
"I think the boss is very economical. He asked one person to take order collect payment ,to fry the Hokkien noodles and also stir-fry the kway tiao and look at the three sides. The other person was frying the carrot cake inside.Today afternoon I ordered a dish of carrot cake be spicy. The person outside cooked it all by himself. It was my dish.  The carrot cake hasn't come yet, and when it does, it's still inedible, and there's no chili. The boss should have woken up. Although the young man standing outside was very polite and kept apologies to me. But i will never go there anymore"
Not tasty. Not worth for $7.50.  Need to improve the taste especially operating the business in a mall.
"Very tasty hokkien mee!! Definitely worth a try if you are in Vivocity.

Remember to ask for: additional chilli and fried pork lard."
Had a bad dinner when ate the hokkien mee. It tasted so saltish. For a plate of $6.50 not worth at all. If you want to live longer think before eating.
The hokkien mee is worth buying.
The Hokkien Mee is flavourful and yummy! Would highly recommmend 
I love the food  will keep buying agian 
Fried Oyster is nice
prawn mee too salty for my liking. carrot cake taste good
"Serving is plenty just nice, food is good. Will come again next time."
The dishes here are all delicious fried and portions are generous. Will definitely come back for more
Nice foods
"Chao Guo Tiao Hen Xiang,Ge Ren Ren Wei Quan Xin Jia Po Zui Hao Chi De Guo Tiao. "
"Really great plate of Hokkien Mee around the area, friendly priced for a decent plate too! Will return again if I'm around the area, thanks!"
"It located at Kopitiam at Vivo, so it will be hard to look for seats during peak period (lunch and dinner timing), but I really do recommend their fried kway teow and Hokkien mee. And, the pricing of the food are affordable.

The cook on the spot once you ordered, so it will be hot when you eat.

Lastly, the staff are nice and friendly!"
"Staff are friendly with good service
The food has a nice local taste and is extremely tasty. Will come back again"
"Feel like eating hokkien mee ? Then this is the place to go for , reasonable price with smoky wok hei flavour in every spoon of it. 2 word, HOH JIAK"
"The noodles were perfectly cooked, exhibiting a delightful chewiness that absorbed the robust flavors of the accompanying ingredients. The smoky wok hei flavor was evident in every bite, offering a satisfying depth that lingered on the palate."
"The noodles taste very niceee, yummy and tasty "
One of the better Kopitiam Char Kway Teows. $9.90 Set meal is a great deal. Recommended
"Ordered the white fried carrot cake at vivocity kopitiam stall. The taste is great, with generous amount of egg. More importantly it was also not too oily."
One of the best service I ever had - people were good and food was stupendous
Very good service. Ordered the White carrot cake. Taste good not too oily.
Friendly service and nice food
Reasonable price with good food! Definitely a must try!
ordered the carrot cake and char kuay diao were neither too oily nor too sweet. Could have a bigger portion though overall taste is amazing. By their combo to value for money.
Food is nice and stall owner is friendly! Currently they are running a promotion at 2 (Hokkien mee / Kway Teow + Carrot cake) for $9.90!
Nice place with great Hokkien Mee and Fried carrot cakes. The food are freshly cooked upon ordering so do expect hot and fresh food on your plate. Staffs are friendly and nice!
"This store is owned by a relative young man who invented the recipe. It's a place for you to get local fares such as your Hokkien Mee, Char Kway Teow and Carrot Cake. Take note that this is in a kopitiam so it would be very crowded and you may find it difficult to get seats.

From my understanding, the hokkien mee's broth was prepared in house hence having a unique sweetness and umami to it. They also prepare and provide pork lard to whoever wants it too. Huge plus to eat their hokkien mee with their belachan chilli because it enhanced the overall flavor so much more.

Their char kway teow was on the drier side yet remain fragrant. Given that this is a young recipe, there will be rooms for improvement. Still, I feel that it has captured some of the key elements where the dark sauce was prominent and the wok being hot enough for the frying.

Overall, not bad for a relatively young recipe and you could give this a try when you're in Vivo!"
"Hokkien meee is amazing, one of the best that I ate before. The Chili is very good and packs a punch. Their style is more on the watery side where you can taste the strong prawn taste. Strongly recommended to try if you are nearby!"
Black Carrot Cake is a must try! Finally found the perfect flavour for my tastebuds!! 
"A wise man once said that Hokkien Mee is best eaten when dabao-ed. Noodles fully absorbed the savoury and robust stock. The chilli elevated the dish to a whole new level, strongly recommend to fellow chilli lovers. Worth the travel all the way to Vivo city for this awesome packet of Hokkien Mee"
"When a friend told me to try it out, I wasn't expecting this - the taste has a unique oomph that you can't find anywhere.
I love it!"
One of the best hokkien mee i tried in SG. Old school flavour hokkien mee in an air-conditioned kopi tiam and will come back for more!
Must try their Hokkien mee with a flavourful gravy that rarely found in other place .
had their hokkien mee and the taste is great. alot of prawn flavor yet maintain the traditional sweetness of the dish. the chili is also spicy enough for me to blend with the noodles.. highly recommended !!!
"Newly opened Old Hup Kee here in vivocity kopitiam. Have opening promotion of fried hokkien mee and fried carrot cake(black/white) for just $9.90
Went for the promotion since I felt hungry.
The hokkien mee is a slightly wet version here. Fragrant stock, served with a few pieces of squid and 2 medium-sized prawns.
While for the carrot cake, i went for the black option. I felt the ratio of eggs and carrot cake is balanced. Tasty and flavourful. Add some chilli to spice up the taste a little.
I enjoyed both dishes and I look forward to trying the fried kway teow."
The aunty who sells lontong/mee siam is very nice. Price is reasonable and quality is good. The Malay aunty who share the same stall and sells the snacks have very bad attitude.
Lontong sauce is a lil spicy. Portion of soft rice cakes is good. Taukwa has a weird packaging smell. Egg is small and overcooked as there is a grey layer around the yolk.
Ordered mee siam and I find it a bit bland and the sour/sweet taste not there.  Don't patronise if you don't have time. The queue was because the staff preparing the food is rather slow. She needed three times to just get the mee siam beehoon on the plate itself. There seems quite a number of staff in the stall but appeared that only one serving food.
"Selling traditional local Cuisines and snacks such as mee siam, mee rebus, somosa, curry puff . Price reasonable."
"I bought tahu goreng for $3/-at Admiralty Branch on 8 0ct 2023@1350 hrs. It looks nice, but when I started to eat the tahu with the peanut sauce the taste was horrible..After one scoop, I decided to leave it. The peanut sauce taste horrible and the tahu was also expired...Pls do a surprise check.."
"My family go to spot for tea time snacks! Their goreng pisang and popiah always very hot and crispy! Have yet to tried their main dishes but their snacks section is great with different varieties. Mak cik is also very cute and friendly! Recommend to eat with a cup of hot teh tarik confirm shiok. Stall is in Kampung Admiralty foodcourt, around the Halal section."
Like the mee Soto and mee sian here. Auntie is friendly. Can request to pack separately if you're not eating it right away.
"Bought the jemput jemput . Inedible . Just all flour . Not really a tint of pisang .  Just super weird .
Have to discard everything .
Very disappointed .

* Not sure how Authentic it is or get from supplier factory ?"
"Went here, before order specifically said to the aunty, Take-Away and separate gravy. After order she mixed the gravy together. Told her separate the gravy and she say i did not. Funny thing is, I bought 3 item all with gravy, mee soto, laksa and lontong, she pack the mee soto gravy separately. Weird! Yet she still say i didnt informed her well in advance. Then she told me off during payment saying to informed her early not last minute. I guess shes tired and old."
"The Sauce served was a little sour, other than that the other food were great"
"First time been to Kampung Admiralty Hawker Center and I took the Lontong ($3.50 with additional pcs of tau kua). The taste is good and like the soup. The stall also selling many varieties of food, try it out if you are there. Love the atmosphere too."
"like the name suggests - they sell the traditional Malay dishes, and the classics, including dishes like tahu goreng. quantity is pretty good for the prices, and most dishes we've tried have been really really good."
Took the lotong and dried mee siam for breakfast and shared with my friends.  Lotong was special with some jackfruit.   It will be good if more jackfruit was added.   Mee Siam was good too.
"I miss the food! The stall has been closed for quite a while already. Anyone knows when will they be back??

Update 28 June 2025, stall is back in business!"
"Another new kid on the block with yummy malay favourites. The lontong is giving another stall a run for money . There are other delicious dish like mee rebus, rendang chicken, sayor lodeh, soto ayam just to name a few. Daily dishes on the shelf, if one prefers nasi padang to suit ones tastebud. Go early as good items get sold out fast ."
"The lontong is so good! Rice cakes are soft and smooth, gravy is coconuty & full of flavour. Sambal is sweet & spicy, with ikan bilis inside. I'm not usually a lontong person, but this one I would travel for & eat again!

This cost $5 after adding begedil! Friendly stall owners, with QR code cashless payment available."
Always long Q and longtong gets sold out early. Gravy a little diluted for my liking but overall a good Longtong set at $4.
"great chicken rendang, boss gave extra as it was closing too"
Sotong. Sambal goreng. Bagedil. $13. Taste wise.. acceptable. Price a bit on the high side but the seller did inform before buying
"Stall insists i have to order a meat, when I only wanted the tofu vege with rice. Queued so long without knowing, had to add meat which added up to $7 kinda crazy. I'll just get from stalls that allow me to just get tofu n vege with rice without such rules"
"Am terribly disappointed with the nasi padang, especially the beef rendang which is so horribly tough (non chewable) and dry, with hardly any gravy given. In fact, the whole piece was just practically covered with muscles, and with the little meat, it was just far too tough. This is my 2nd time trying after at least 8 months, hoping that the standard would improve.  Alas, no luck at all. The meat was exactly the same - awfully tough & unedible. Even the quality of the other nasi padang dishes has dropped tremendously. Thankfully, only the lontong standard has been maintained but I wonder for how much longer. Prices have increased but quality sucks.  Hopefully the cook will pay more attention to having tender rendang, not some inedible piece of muscle."
"Had lontong ($4) for breakfast, was extremely good. They serve other dishes too, I'll be back to try them all."
"The longtong is one of the best in Singapore (and some say Batam). It has jackfruit in it if I'm not wrong. Its rich n creamy.
Also must add sotong for extra taste. Usually sold out in the afternoon, so buy early."
"the rendang chicken is my favorite. imo, one of the best in sg. the family running the store is super friendly too."
"Dined in on 3/5 morning.

Tried the lontong. Hands down one of the better examples of lontong that I have had in a very long time.

Full flavour, hefty portion, very filling. Ingredients were on point, the turnip was firm and the tofu warm.

Delish."
"Nice but expensive for its portion, I would rather get economy rice with some spice"
Tried rice with 1 miserable chicken wing and 2 pieces of brinjal for $6. Taste nothing to shout about.
Best lontong!
Unique longtong with nangka. $3.50
"Read so much about the special lontong with jackfruit ($3.50 a portion) that I had to try it. The spices were well blended to give the gravy an overall fragrance and smoothness. It was creamy enough without being ""jelat"". The best part of the dish was the serunding. The sweetness of the coconut brought the taste to the next level. This is a must have. My biggest grouse was that it was too salty especially the jackfruit and the cabbage. The chef could go light on the salt.
The lovely surprise to our breakfast was the mee goreng. The mee goreng came with many big pieces of fish cake and lots of chye sim. We were surprised to dig up a fairly big prawn. For $3.50 a portion this was really unbelievable and pocket friendly. The mee goreng had the right level of sweetness and spiciness."
A local's favourite in this vicnity. A must stop for Nasi Padang lovers
"Good malay food like nasi padang and lontong. The store opens in the morning and food usually sold out by 11am.
They don't operate after 1pm once the food is sold out."
Good wholesome food
"One of the best nasi padang I ever tried, the portion is of good size and came with coconut shaving, the rendang chicken is tender, and love the eggplant too. The price is very reasonable too, the only disappointment is didn't get to try the lontong with jackfruit as it was sold out."
Great food at great price! Their lontong and nasi padang are highly recommended. Owners are friendly and service is efficient.
"Tried it after reading the review from Class 95 makan kakis! Indeed one of the best lontongs I have tasted so far! The gravy is lemak and rich, which the kind I like. It's priced friendly at $3! Their nasi padang is really delicious too! Also on sale are some nice home made snacks like peanut crackers and green bean crackers!"
"Makansutra Nasi Melayu 5/6

<Pros>
Sambal is rich and not too spicy
Tempe is moist and tasty
Ingredient is generous portion and fresh cooked
<Cons>
Fish curry is average and fish is dry
Not easy access location

Satisfying lunch and at reasonable price too. Their lontong is yummy too and it's worth a trip to taste some of the best in the East.
Super shiok lontong with jack fruit as part of the lodeh (veggies)
Awesome and wonderfully seasoned food. All their dishes are yummy and leave anyone satisfied.
What can you ask for buying the best lontong from the friendliest stall.. Always enjoy a chat with the stall holders ending with a smile on all the faces..
"Ouh, yes. Try it to believe it. The food were awesome, name it, breakfast and lunch. Felt so grateful to have nice food near my area. I love to patronize the stall. Owner so friendly and polite as well. And the most is their cleanliness. I give a thumb's up. "
"Went there multiple times for their famous Coriander Chicken Indomie and added their new Tiger Prawn Ala Carte! Love the crunch!

Also did a bulk order for my corporate event!

Lime Rice!
Coriander Chicken!
Indomie!
Tiger Prawn!"
"First time tried ayam goreng ketumbar yesterday. My hubby said it's nice , especially the green rice & sambal. As indonesian, we really love sambal & it remind us of our hometown. Very excited to know there is indonesian food near our place. Owner was so friendly, he checked n made sure everything is good & said can refill the sambal if not enough. Will try other menu next time!!"
"Just had the coriander chicken with lime rice. I loved the bakwan (veggie fritter) and tempe. Batter was very delicious.

Chicken and the sambal was excellent, wish I asked for more sambal."
"When the word is 'hidden gem' is often overused, yet it is an understatement not to use this word to describe this place.
It is a wonder to have such nice food at such a remote place... I ordered the coriander fried chicken rice and yes the fried chicken comes crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.
I have to complement on the sides fried tempeh which is the rare alternative of the usual... and of course the chilli is one with kick that will spice up your life!
all in all this is truly a great dish that will draw me back!"
Delicious Indonesian food cuisine and recommend to order their fried chicken with lime rice set
super friendly owners and amazing Indonesian cuisine. handmade everything from scratch daily. Ayam goreng must try!! and their fragrant spiced rice is soooo gooooooood!! 
"Wonderful place in the north to have an affordable, tasty and delicious Indonesian food. A must to try their signature lime rice as well as their juicy Coriander Fried Chicken."
Unique indonesian food at an affordable price. A definite must try if you are in Woodlands!
"IG recommend, mocha milk, look nice and yummy but too sweet for me. A very long Q, waited for 30mins."
The best pasar malam ever
"One of the bigger pasar malams in Singapore -- definitely more variety than usual.

Plenty of food options, from traditional Malay and Middle Eastern snacks to newer, more modern stuff. Thai, Taiwan, Korean... Less Chinese food stalls compared to other markets, but still a good mix.

Families with kids -- there are rides, carnival-style games, and entertainment scattered around. The hawkers also seem younger.

It's not a permanent fixture, check ahead. Usually runs for a few weeks at a time."
"Shout out to Meat My Meat Singapore for their amazing Philly Cheesesteak menu that was worth trying especially during the month of Ramadan when most breaking fast meals tend to be on the heavier and heartiest side. But, this Mozza Philly Cheesesteak is just perfect for filling up an empty stomach after a day's fasting without overbearing or jelak.

The amount of beef slices and cheese is well-proportioned and served with a small side of fries, you can eat up without the need to get bloated. Very well-seasoned and the taste is quite pronounced throughout the entire meal. Kudos! This was a better alternative than eating the same repeated Ramly burgers or kebabs that can just bore the appetite."
"My honest opinion, please sell quality food not cincai  or asal boleh. Don't sell leftover kueh , please throw it away. Freshly made doesn't apply here.
Frozen seafood shouldn't be used. The result, rubber band taste,  like eating chewing gum . Putu bambu was hard, not sure what flour was used .
Prawn Vadei is the best, served hot & soft .  Otak otak & Ajmir Briyani are highly recommended."
Is good & easier to go home
"Very authentic Malaysian and middle Eastern hawker food.
Lots of hassle and bussel and heaps of stuff for kids.
Is attached to a massive shopping mall that is very nice"
"Permanent night market. Hardly see it close. But when it does, the woodlands vibe is gone. 5 star not because of the food, but the vibes it brings to woodlands. Food is just normal pasar malam food. Price has been increasing like mad the past few years. But it is what made woodlands lively.

Update 26/6: Tried more food today. Go for the Prawn paste ($7), Taro pie ($3 for 2). Skip the Kebab at the front.

Update 2024: they added some claw machine store where the catch rate is 1 in 5 tries. Hope they come back again next year."
Not bad place
The durian is so expensive cost 60 DOLLARS. Inside only 5 seeds. Very dry and hard. Kana con
"Came across the same booth at the KSL pasar malam in JB, but was too full then to try so I'm glad they opened here too!

  (2 /$3)
- Generously covered with white sesame seeds, super fragrant, reminded me of a traditional chinese snack!!
- Biscuits were very crunchy and not greasy at all despite being deep fried as they didn't absorb the oil.
- Yam paste was quite smooth though flavour was rather muted and overpowered by the sesame which I didn't mind.

Follow @iloafbready Instagram for more food reviews! "
Many  local foods and quite lively. 3 stars because prices are too high and many of those food sold there can be bought for half the price at the  two malls beside it.
A lot of food varieties to choose from and definitely very yummy too! Went with fam and friends and had a good time.
"Good place to shop, price is reasonable with a lot of nice food"
Variety of  local food
"They have many varieties of food you can choose with affordable prices, love it "
Varieties of food and drinks available. Look forward to the next one!
All time favourite 
"You can enjoy lots of different delicious food in this place.

I was really excited to see all different foods and was happy to choose which food i need to choose for my dinner."
The pasar malam at Woodlands is great! It is the biggest pasar malam I had been to. I love to play at the games carnival section. It provides a thrilling joy. The F & B stalls food were salivating. The mocktails and milk teas were great too. I like the tutu kueys and potatoes too. A great recommendation.
"It's a very vibrant pasar malam just next to causeway point mall @ woodlands mrt, many food stalls and uncle Ringo in full swings, many toy rides for kids and adults, it will open from 1-30 June "
The pad Thai cannot make it. Don't try. The potato rosti ok.
Chou Dou Fu very nice
"Immerse yourself in the vibrant and bustling atmosphere of Pasar Malam, a beloved night market located in the heart of Woodlands. As the sun sets and the twinkling lights come alive, this bustling market becomes a hub of activity, offering an exciting array of sights, sounds, and tastes."
"Wide variety of stalls n nice and family oriented place, awesome quality of food!:)"
Lots of stalls.
This one is causeway point near some many varieties food and entertainment all have
"Hardly see it close. But when it does, the woodlands vibe is gone. the vibes it brings to woodlands."
Great food
Good place
They alot of non halal foods. But kids love the uncle Ringo funfair.
"Pasar malam honestly isn't the same as before anymore, aside from the price hike, the usual food/snacks we had (The OG takoyaki stalls, ramly) are no longer there and kinda hard to find. Newer stalls took over and yknow novelty to appeal to all ages. So everything is more expensive and fancy. The taste never get better tho  Overall it's alright, there are seats for you to eat, it's only best if you also be a considerate user and clean after you otherwise it'll be a messy place for sure. If you care about aesthetics and stuff, it's somewhat questionable esp for this time round one (June 2023), sakura trees with a bunch of neon LED lights is kinda weird like, you want night market feels or picnic under the sakura trees man  Anyway! I wouldn't travel all the way there for the food and i guess don't expect too much, the food is decent, just nothing special"
nice but very ex
"The Pasar Malam has gotten very expensive compared to years ago
Ramly Burger isn't bad
Just alright"
"Very big place. The pasar malam have so much different stalls. Very lively place. If you want to go to this place, you can take MRT and alight at Woodlands MRT Station or bus interchange. Thank you "
A lot choice but expensive
Great food and special treats
"Pasar Malam @ Woodlands Square, wah, really shiok! Got so many things to jio your friends for. From finger-licking good murtabak to mouth-watering chicken wings, confirm sedap one. Aunties and uncles selling cheap clothes and accessories, can bargain somemore. Don't forget to try the colorful ondeh-ondeh and refreshing sugarcane juice. Got games and toys for the little ones too. Best part is, it's in Woodlands, so convenient for us northerners. Confirm jin ho jiak, cannot tahan! Must go leh!"
Place to get my beef burger and Tutu which are my favourite must eat food.
Good food and environment. Recommended
Very good place.
Alot of food and drinks that very attempted..
Not yet go there. Shall update my review after that.
The place was good and nice ambiance . With nice food and drinks
Pasar Malam @ Woodlands have many variety of Foods and the Prices are affordable. I love the food here you should come to try
"Pasar Malam @ Woodlands is a lively and energetic night market that pulsates with a vibrant atmosphere, providing an abundance of culinary delights and shopping prospects. Nestled in the heart of Woodlands, it has become a sought-after destination for both locals and tourists.

The market showcases an impressive assortment of food stalls, offering an enticing array of local street food and international cuisines. Visitors are treated to a feast for the senses as they savor the diverse flavors and aromas that represent the culinary tapestry of Singapore."
Tons of food at affordable prices. Brings back nostalgic memories. Had a good time there walking around and snacking. Can get a little warm though
"great place to try out a wide varieties of food & prices are quite affordable, its good there's an area where you can sit down and enjoy the food there!"
Got Thailand local food
Variety of food and items available
So many things to choose from at a very cheap cost
Many types of foods and things to see. It is a good place to go for jalan-jalan if hv nothing to do during night time. Kids will b happy to be there .
Nice pasar malam with quite a lot of stores
"Chi Jia Bu Yuan,Tui Jian"
Price not that affordable
nice food and good locations
"Cheap delicious food! A must go after work, rich variety food for dinner "
"Old skool marketplace!! Lots of food stalls and selections . But can be crowded and smelly so bring your own portable fan!!!

Indeed a place to enjoy!!"
Never fail to come everytime as this is my childhood place! A lot street foods and stalls for a bargained price !
Good old Pasar Malam. Like the good old nostalgic feel!
Woodlands pasar malam with over 14 stalls and Uncle Ringo's carnival rides and games till 26 Feb 2023. Juan Sufyan.
"Great foods, usually in Pasar Malam you can get only few good foods. but here in Woodlands Square I almost tried all the foods, & snacks, the Kebab is my fav. try this out."
The food was delicious and the shop owners are friendly. there are a lot of food varieties. Must visit if you have time.
Nice place
bustling place with lots to see and eat
"Wide place

More tasty drinks"
"just besides Causeway point, nice experience. kids will love it too."
A lot of foods to choose from at an affordable price! Satisfied my cravings
Food was delicious and can get at cheaper price
Variety of local and fusion food with affordable prices.
Nostalgic and amazing! Good vibes and good variety of shops!
Different atmosphere from the usual shopping malls. Worth checking out
"Great place to talk a walk, eat good food, enjoy the busy street market , see the people from all walks of life busy buying stuff that they like"
It is very big pasar malam and have various stalls available. Rlitre serves drinks per litre. They come in both milk and mocktail flavours such as Thai milk tea and mandarin sour plum. Price was so cheap. Must to visit this place.
Never fail to come everytime as this is my childhood place! A lot street foods and stalls for a bargained price !
Big and interesting pasar malam. Worth to go!
There are lots of food to be enjoyed and lots of choices in most affordable prices!
"Urmm i found the takoyakis are quite disappointing....extremely cheapskate sauce, calit2 sikit2 je, then rasa tepung 99% inti ciput je...they should learn from malaysian hawkers how to make the nice takoyakis."
A worthwhile hub to visit with the family for food and a lot of other stuff!
Good location for north side people. During this month a lot of choices can be made. Always got something to buy.
all the food is very delicious
One of the best pasar malam in singapore
"Many foods and drinks to buy from there, although it's crowded but it's nice to walk and window shopping at the dinner time."
Food is a little pricey. But overall it's okay. 
Best of all time pasar malam in singapore. Food getting great.
"Since covid 19, Pasar Malam are relatively rare view and are encouraged to support more of this local business"
"A small Singapore night market where they sell all kinds of foods and accessories..
Cheap and tasty."
Good place to explore
As usual the crowd but there is Chinese food n malay food n vadai ... don go evening as super super crowded
The food was delicious and friendly staff made us feel more comfortable. Thank you. Must visit another time
This place was awesome and good
Nice to have pasar malam again after all the covid restriction . Nice foods and snacks .
Miss this mega pasar malam.. food varieties are great. And love the feels
The food was delicious and friendly staff made us feel more comfortable. Thank you. Must visit another time
Nice change from the surrounding malls and shops. A full scale pasar malam after 2 years of Covid. There is now a proper sitting area where you can buy any food and take your time to eat. The rosti store is pretty good albeit rather expensive for what is essentially street snacks.
night market should be good and cheap food. Surprisingly expensive and still got ppl give good stars
Got Halal and Non Halal Food here. Today last day.
Expansive but as long it nice I am okay...
Big pasar malam till 10 dec! Many varieties of food and drinks. It's lovely to see the crowd again :)
Pasar malam with variety
"It's a pasar malam. Lots of food and stuff to buy.

Just located beside Causeway Point"
East coast gem. Unassuming place but I went on recommendation by a friend. Meats are well grilled and very tasty and juicy.
Fresh and refreshing salad.
"Delicious Iraqi food! I'm Arab myself and never tried Iraqi dishes. My family ordered the chicken tabshir, kofta kebab, and hummus.

The chicken was smoked and so tender, the hummus was terrific, and the owner is so friendly and helpful. He was extremely patient with us, as we had trouble ordering and figuring out how to lay (were tourists.)

Great seating in a busy street area. Only wish they had more fans as it was slightly hot and humid.

Pete's is part of a hawker establishment, it seems. I enjoyed a Delirium IPA from the bar next door."
Very very very very very good meat highly recommend amazing food and Pete is very nice. (Get chicken wrap it is amazing)
"Have been eating at Pete's for the last 2.5 years now and there has never been a time I've been disappointed, be it the kebabs, the pilaf, the falafel or the hummus, it's all cooked and seasoned to perfection.
Tried the latest addition to the menu - the wagyu steak on pilaf and it was simply delicious. I'd always recommend Pete's to anyone who wants a no frills, all taste experience in Joo Chiat."
Love the food here!
The grilled chicken was excellent ..though think I should have ordered with rice as the bread was a tad too soggy..beef w rice was average.Would come back for the grilled chicken
Best chicken and hummus! Super fresh and service is amazing!
Good food and good taste at a good price - double portion wagyu beef rice at 17$. 15$ is you give a good review. So I tasted it before I review. It's good 
Cozy place. Well presented and tasty
"Absolutely delicious (charcoal makes a huge difference, meat had no hint of freezer burn so perhaps made and chilled and cooked upon order).  Probably a good idea to takeaway or get it delivered coz there's no airconditioning and they don't serve arak.  Hmm - maybe next time i'll try at ask Alibabar whether they have pastis."
"Tashreeb with pita pieces, gravy, chickpeas, well seasoned, smokey chicken meat."
Ordered food delivery and the portion is way too small for its price. The mediterranean restaurants around bugis are even better
"Fantastic food but portion sizes far too small la for that price, come on"
We ordered the Lamb Kofta and Falafel and chicken plate. Everything was too salty for our liking except for the flat bread (not salty and tasted good) and salad. Can visit if you like salty food :)
"Ordered the Kebab-Rice, Lamb Kofta. Lamb was flavoured well. The rice was really good except that it wasn't served warm enough.

The portions were okay as it was mostly rice + 1 skewer of lamb. $19 was a little pricey. But, might come back again if I'm in the area

Ordered hummus at $8. It was okay.  I wouldn't get it again."
Had beef and lamb pita with hummus and it's really good. Meats are well seasoned and pairs well with the wrap and hummus. Just wished that portion is rather small for the price.
"It's great food. Meat marination is done well. However, since my first visit last year, it has gotten a bit pricier and sometimes a miss with quality. Hope they keep up with the standards."
"This is a very interesting place. A corner hawker center style shop. Food is delicious. We had falafel wraps and hummus. It was good quality, good taste and good service. There are high tables outside and you can enjoy watching people all around in the area"
"We often go there and like the food albeit a bit pricy for what it is. The falafel with humus is delicious, the beef wrap feels very fresh and simple but so small that it leaves a need to repeat the order (very clever). We did and went for a second wrap with chicken. I must say it was extremely salty and less appetizing than the beef version. All by all a small shop with decent food located in the vibrant Alibaba hawker"
"I really enjoyed the falafel, hummus and pita. The damage of this plate was $18. I'd rate this place a 7/10.

Falafels were freshly fried so they came out hot, crispy and tender. Instead of the sad dry dust balls that are common here in Singapore, the ones here were moist and full of spices and herbs. The flavor profile of the spice mix is quite different too.

The pitas were like toasted pockets of sweet soft dough. They are quite different from the thicker ones that are usually found around Haji lane. They were basically ultra-thin double-layered pillows. Mostly on the sweet side with a hint of fermented flavor. I really liked them.

Hummus was somewhere between rough and smooth. Like it was mostly very smooth with some variations in texture, in a good interesting way. I could taste the bitterness of the tahini and a distinct lemon note from lemon juice (obviously haha). Salt and acid were nicely balanced. Olive oil was alright, not fragrant but not yucky rancid.

They even used sumac spice powder on the salad. The onions were lightly pickled with white vinegar, mellowing their sharpness, which went well with the rest of the meal. Tomatoes and lettuce were average fare for Singapore.

Considering all of the above evidence, my uneducated guess is that this store originates from the south eastern side of the Mediterranean.

I feel a little sad thinking that the main improvement would be for them to use fresh chickpeas and tahini, which is basically impossible in this part of the world. So all in all, I think it's about as good as it gets."
"Tasty hummus, grilled chicken and bread - Mediterranean style."
Very nice turkish food. The falafel is so crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside.
Took away a double skewer of lamb kofta and humus and it was absolutely delicious. There was salad and warm bread included too. Yummy!!!
Yummy Mediterranean food in a coffee shop
"For someone that likes Hummus, Falafel, and grilled Kofta, this place has one of the best at very affordable price. While the place is non air-conditioned, it is actually quite airy in the evening for a drink and enjoy the delectable Mediterranean food."
The food is good but a little bit pricey.
Great place
My favorite place to eat. Friendly owner n great service staff. Highly recommended
"Food was of fair value

On the contrary, FOH cashier was such a turn off. If he was Pete, I'm sorry but you are not showcasing any good customer service.

I asked him if Paynow was acceptable but he could only simply point towards his A4 paper, showing various payment methods. Initial glance, the Paynow Logo was v small, so I decided to just ask as it would make the process much simpler but he could not even say 'yes' and his reasoning was there are many types of methods to pay. I confronted him and said, you could just 'yes' right? But he only could shake his head.

Totally such a turn off."
"This place is truly exceptional, offering excellent value for the money. The arabic food boasts delightful flavors, generous portions, and a stellar staff that enhances the overall experience."
"I had Pete's platter with Hummus, which was close to $50, sharing with a friend.

It's a really decent place for hummus and kebabs. Meat was seasoned well and I like the salad that comes with it.

It's priced a little higher than what I'd like to come back regularly, but overall I've come back multiple times over the past few years and not been disappointed as the quality and serving sizes have remained consistent."
Good hummus and pita bread
SHOULD TRY place .. may be among the best
"Can't go wrong with Petes's for kebabs. Been coming here for years and the quality is always top notch.

Highly recommend the lamb kebabs - they are probably my favourite across Singapore."
One of my favourite mediterranean places! The owner's really nice. Been patronising the stall for a long time. Their hummus is to die for. The grilled beef skewers with rice is excellent too!
Great kebab platter and Kunefe in a cosy locale !
Good place to grab a decent kebab when you are in the mood for it ...
"Pete looked at wristwatch and said it is 3 minutes before 12, you are too early. So we waited before seated ourselves. Nobody else was at the counter. We ordered 2 skewers of beef kofta with hummus and falafel with hummus. Falafel was poorly cooked and was soggy, hummus was with some bitterness suggesting that they do not clean chickpeas before making hummus. Kofta tasted as hamburger meat with bread. In addition instead of pita they served tortilla pieces.
Never before in my life eaten Mediterranean food made without any care or pride"
Great taste and good try for our 1st time on Mediterranean grills foods! This are today special dishes!
"Ordered Chicken with Hummus and find it nice Serving was small so ordered another with fries. Chicken was well cooked and flavourful.
Pricing above average."
The food was great. Meat was fresh and tasty. The spicy sauce is fantastic :)
The food is delicious and fresh
My most favourite Mediterranean food ever in my whole life.Always coming back.
"15 SGD for a beef kofta with bread, miserable portion, 1 kofta, 50% is salad, small thin slices of bread,  it took 3 minutes to finish it. Had to order a 6$ Fried rice to fill my stomach. The price doesn't justify the portion. Sorry Pete's you lost a client ... "
"Surprisingly good taste.
The red hot  sauce was extremely spicy and came with a warning, but I enjoyed it. The green hot sauce is for the less adventurous.

Lamb Kofta , Falafel and Babaganoush was excellent."
"Ordered the mix grill with hummus on grabfood for 65 bucks and to say I was disappointed would be a very nice way to put it. If you ever wanted to feel how inflation truly feels like in Singapore this might be one good way to do it. With the tiny morsel of food provided at this price you would have thought most of the cost would have gone to bringing Anthony Bourdain back from the dead just to cook it instead of purchasing ingredients. Instead the meats were on the saltier side, pita was closer to paper than bread, and the salad looked like something you'd pull out of a Big Mac (no offence to the Big Mac tho). Overall I'd give still give the food a generous 6/10 not considering the price (with price factored in, 2/10). That said I waited over an hour for my delivery to reach me so it was cold by the time it got here. Seems more like a Grab problem so wouldn't be ordering from this place on Grab again."
"Lovely place at East Coast road,love the meat and hot sauce!"
Amazing Kebabs and Fallafel! Loved it with the spicy sauce.
Misleading specials and portions were really not worth the $$ spent.
"Great food, loved the falafels."
"Nice place for great Mediterranean food. This is inside AlibabaR Hawker area. Limited places to sit.. but the food is amazing, everything is charcoal grilled! Hummus was excellent! Go for Pete's grill! Must try for food!!"
"Seats are shared with a few other stalls within this eatery. You order from the shop you want to eat from.
Falafel were large, crispy, fluffy and delicious. The hummus texture was just right - not an amorphous baby food mush, not too chunky, and very tasty. Lamb kofta was on the salty side for me, but tasty nonetheless and of a good meaty texture. Thoroughly enjoyed both versions of chili blend - the green one and the red one. Warning for regular people: the red one is very spicy. Pita bread was on the flat side, a bit taco-like.
The owner is friendly and approachable.
Will definitely be back!"
The food was very nice but the price is much too high
Just had the most amazing humus. Thanks Pete. So tasty and just the real thing!
better than Arab street lol
Tasty Arab Food.
"Some people here have mentioned how helpful the staff were but when we were served by the owner Pete, he was just plain old annoyed! I'm a very polite customer who comes with a smile, and all I asked was one question about a dish, which he gave a curt, annoyed reply to. Anyway, I don't know why I continued with ordering but I did, and having paid $23 or so, I felt it was overpriced and underwhelming. The food isn't anything special, and definitely not worth the attitude that comes with it!"
bipeu kebab masisseoyong~
"Had chicken and Lamb with my other half for brunch. Served with smooth hummus, salad, naan and topped with chicken and lamd skewer. Both grilles skewers are surprisingly moist and flavourful. The hummus paired super well with both skewers and naan. At 30SGD shared by 2 pax and tasted that good and hearty of a meal... Worth it "
"Very nice food, meat is high quality and tasty. The quality is worth the price."
"Excellent quality/price food, cordiality and nice service ... super suggested !"
Lunch was tasty but the quantity of food is very less ie disappointing..feedback will be to increase the food with sufficient quantity
Always amazing food at Pete's. The falafel is amazing! Love the dips too - especially the baba ganoush.
Good authentic Mediterranean flavours! Worth a visit if you like hummus and grilled meats!
"Food is nice, however portion is small for price. Thought is a restaurant but more like a upscale coffee shop. Atmosphere is quite hip though."
The food and service was okay. You may want to skip this place.
"definitely a gem. their dishes are freshly made, and very authentic in flavor. Ask for their homemade chilli sauce!!"
"Walked past this place a gazillion times (it's a multi-eatery concept), so glad we made it in tonight! Pete's food is authentic, and the flavours are proof. Had the lamb, well done, rice was also done right. Hummus was the star, so silky, rich, decadent. Bought another home, couldn't resist. Not an eastie, but will be back for more"
Best hummus and falafel I've had! Chicken and beef were great too!
"Food was delicious but attitude of owner Pete is disappointing. For the portion of food, it's over priced."
The lamb and chicken were perfectly done! So juicy and tender. The flatbread and hummus were also good. Will definitely be back to order more.
I have been going here since I moved to Katong September 2020. I have always been happy with what comes out of the kitchen and the service despite all struggles with pandemic rules. I also not sure what people are on about attitude? I see he goes extra mile to serve customers even when busy. Last visit was by far the best food I had there so far and it will not be the last.
"Food was good, that i didn't manage to take a photo.

Negative reviews are mostly based on his attitude. I guess they caught him at the wrong time.

Now with helpers and people in the kitchen, I feel he was very welcoming, no complains at all.

Food wise, beyond excellent. He knows his stuff, will be back."
Poor quality food
"I really love the middle eastern food here. One of the best places in this area.
Will recommend to everyone. Babaganoush is my favorite.

I see some reviews mentioning poor attitude, but personally I've never encountered.
He always seev d me with smile on face"
Underwhelming food and poor service attitude. Borderline arrogant
What an absolutely delicious falafel wrap! Great flavours and textures. All fresh.
Been here many times and it will be the last. Owner attitude totally unacceptable today! Rude.
"TL;DR Owner accused mum and I of lying (we weren't) when he asked a misleading question.

My parents have visited Pete's Mediterranean Grill multiple times before and enjoyed it, so we visited again this nice Friday afternoon. Well, it was nice until the accusations ensued.

My mum and I sat together while my dad sat alone. I got a burger and my mum ordered two dishes from Pete (assuming that's his name because he's the owner of aforementioned food stall).

Her dishes arrived before mine, and Pete set the plates down onto our table.

Here's where you need to pay attention.

He asked, and I quote, ""Are you having anything else? No pita or rice?"" We said no because we didn't want anything else from Pete's grill. Because that's what he meant, right?

My food comes and I place it in front of me. My mum has both dishes closer to her. My cutleries from Pete are still wrapped, while my mum is digging in.

Pete comes over and says, again, I quote, ""Please don't mix the cutlery."" We nodded and said of course. But that wasn't the end. He went on, saying ""I asked you just now if you were having anything else, and you said no.""

Huh? He asked if we wanted any pita bread or rice, not about other food. I explained accordingly.

You'd think that was the end. But he came back with the nice quip of ""You were being dishonest."" Oh, wait now, hold up.

I never mix halal and non-halal cutlery - my family and friends know that I'm particular about respecting other cultures.

I can easily brush off rude or snide comments, but accusations like this about something I strongly believe in? No sir.

We reiterated that this was not conveyed, and he said something along the lines of ""I always ask this, but maybe it didn't go through."" Did he mean miscommunication? Or was he saying I didn't understand English? No problem, I gave Pete the benefit of doubt and went with the former.

As my mum and I tried to get rid of the icky feeling and continue with our supposedly relaxing lunch after a day at the beach, Pete came back out of nowhere and said ""Normally I try to have good relationship with customers.""

No idea what prompted him to say this. It was uncalled for. Anyway, tried to explain myself again (in hindsight, maybe I shouldn't have tried so hard and just stood up for myself instead of getting bullied), but he didn't bother listening and just walked off.

My mum and I talked about the situation and just let it blow over. Once we finished our meals, we'd decided to share our experience and never come back.

As a cherry on top, a staff (from the entire eating area, not Pete's Grill) came and cleared both my mum and my plates, and guess what? HE STACKED THE DAMN PLATES AND MIXED THE CUTLERY ANYWAY.

I'm not saying it's ok to mix the cutlery and utensils. But come on, as the boss of the place, you've definitely seen them clear plates before. So why come attack customers when this is apparently a usual occurrence?

Appalling and mind boggling."
Pleasantly surprised by the quality of the 3 types of Kebabs that I had. The rice item was also cooked with care with right balance of spices. Especially recommend the Lamb kebab which has a tinge of minty aftertaste.
"Decent wraps, slightly over priced, but very conveniently located and fast service."
Falafel wrap was alright. Thought it was exorbitantly priced on Deliveroo though - $18.20 for a small wrap (which includes a $3.99 delivery fee).
"Amazing food! Love both the chicken and the lamb. You are spoilt for choice in terms of what to choose, whether rice or hummus as sides because both are excellent. Beware the chilli on the side is really hot!"
"Omg ! This place surprised me ! Loved the lamb and chicken kebabs! They were so soft and yummy, just melt in the mouth ! Pete himself recommended what we should order and it was just perfect and even got us his chilly chutney which was by far the spiciest and yummy I've had so far in Singapore! Kudos to the warm hospitality and delicious food ! We will see return soon !"
"Deliciously juicy kebabs Hummus is fluffy, and light. Very impressed, will come back"
"Their skewers taste great. Even the rice is quite flavourful. Located in alibabar, a nice hawker / bar in east coast."
"Was feeling a little adventurous and wanted to try something different, and this place was just round the corner at a busy junction. Ordered the chicken and lamb kebab, as well as the falafels, and it tastes amazing! The salad sides made the whole meal more nutritious and wholesome, the falalels were crispy on the exterior and had a delectable interior mash. The meats were charred to perfection, oh and the hummus 
My only gripe is that the portions are a little small"
"UPDATE:

I went to Pete's Mediterranean Grill few days ago and the food was very good. The owner is very friendly. I think i am now satisfied to chnage the ratings to 5 Star.

Good food,
Good Price,
Good Hospitality,
-----------
UPDATE:
I spoke to grab customer service and find out Pete was right and the food was prepared.

A bad mistake from Grab caused both parties to lose . me as a customer lost my time and Pete as a restaurant had to prepare a food which was never delivered which was eventually a loss for them.

I'm changing my review to 4 stars for pete cause they indeed had the courtesy to try and reachout but Grab missed it.

I will update my review once I try the Grill.
Thanks Pete for the update

-----------
I made an order through Grab app and after 1.5 hour of waiting time they simply canceled my order. I would call this a terrible customer service. They didn't have the courtesy to call and inform me about the situation. Terrible!!!!"
"Tasty food and friendly, helpful service. I look forward to coming back and trying other dishes."
"I ordered online, kabab rolls, came stuff with lots veggies, there wasn't enough meat, I think it was only for flavour.. hummus is full of salt & garlic .. Not even feel like eating Mediterranean food."
Great portions. The falafels were a bit too garlicky
"Considering you're the owner with your face plastered on the signboard, you could do with a friendlier attitude. Giving blank looks when I asked questions (which apparently seems dumb to you but not to me) gives a cold demeanour that instantly turned me off.

Sure, the wraps do taste pretty decent but the amount of meat inside is quite abysmal. It was mostly vegetables inside, which I'm fine with if I asked for a heavier vegetable proportion, but more meat would have been appreciated.

Overall a rather disappointing experience considering how I purposely headed down to try your wraps. Oh well, I'll stick to Stuff'd for wraps."
"Great food, good service "
"Food is ok, i find quite nice to have different styles and a beer selection so large. Price is ok la"
I understand that you are closing but I'm just asking if you are still taking orders as this is my first time here and the drink servers say I can still order if I order now. You do not have to simply just ignore my presence and not answer to me. It's really rude and uncalled for.
"the lamb kebab is juicy and always good, spicy hummus is tasty. For me it's of the best kebab is SG."
Hygiene could be better (roaches flying around)
"Chanced upon this place after dining at Alibabar The Hawker Bar and the food didn't disappoint! The owner Pete is friendly and was helpful with recommendations. The falafels were tasty and the hummus is all-time favourite. The kofte and kebabs are delicious too and it's great for sharing. They are a relatively new stall but they have a variety of Mediterranean dishes that can compete with the Turkish restaurants located in Bussorah street. Try the food here, you won't be disappointed!"
"If the picture doesn't tell you everything you need to know, then idk what will.

I've come here a few times and they got it right every single time. 5/5 for consistency!

Also had lamb and chicken with hummus. Another 5/5.

Their babaganoush dip is also delicious.

This place is such a hidden gem."
Certainly the best kebab islandwide
"Pete's is located in AliBabar Eat Coast Road. The beef and lamb koftas taste great. You could also opt for chicken cubes is red meat is not for you. Instead of rice, you could also choose fresh vegetables salad. For snacks, try the sweet potato fries. It's savory and tasty. Pete's offers other med food like kebabs. Best of all, three price is reasonable, and the relaxing ambience makes the experience a great one."
"Ordered Pete's platter, and it was really good. The platter had , one skewer of each, beef , lamb & chicken.  Really enjoyed the time here. The service was also really good.
Thank you Pete ."
"great food, very rare to find in this part of the world."
"Ordered the lamb kofta wrap. I think wraps really aren't their forte - the gumminess of the wrap was a complete disservice to lamb kofta, which was actually quite juicy and flavoursome. The rest of the vegetables and dressing within the wrap were pretty meh too. Would come back to try more grilled meats instead."
It is great to have a place to enjoy good Mediterranean meals in the neighborhood. The Moroccan soup and the falafel are my favorite. I wish they move to a larger facility so they expand the menu with more options. (Including baklavas!)
"Love the wraps, and chicken kebabs that include fresh salads.  Yummy and healthy!   Moroccan soup was the new menu addition and just excellent for a light dinner meal.
Also a great chillout place, with prompt and friendly service.)"
My favorite: lamb kebab with hummus and the salad. . Owner & the staff are very friendly.
What I can said its awesome !!!love the spicy humus and the kebab!  Falafel was fantastico! The lamb is so freaking juicy!  Their service is good and friendly 
like the home made moroccan soup and hummus dip.
"Enjoyed the falafels, thin crust Mediterranean bread, and rice. Owner is friendly guy! Nice talking every time I'm there."
"Waited 30 mins for an OK if slightly anemic chicken wrap while the rest of the party finished their Thai meals ages ago. In the meantime a slew of Deliveroo orders came and went and another party was served ahead. In the end, they ended up using a blowtorch to heat up the chicken pieces. Won't be coming back."
Reasonable pricing
"Super smooth and delicious chee cheong fun! 

Tried Pin Wei Chee Cheong Fun and was really impressed. The rice rolls are extremely smooth and silky, with a perfect texture that just slides down. 

The sauce is fragrant and well-balanced, complementing the chee cheong fun without overpowering it. Each bite is simple yet so satisfying!

Definitely a must-try if you're a fan of chee cheong fun. Highly recommended! "
"Loved this place! Get a spread of fried chicken, egg, beans, eggplant, curried cabbage - you can't go wrong. My regret was ordering only one piece of fried chicken."
"WORST customer service ever. Absolutely spoiled my mood eating here. Previous times were fine & i actually liked the food. But this one time, the aunties working there are so rude!!! The one scooping rice literally shouts at you (when im literally 2 persons away up til my turn, the people in front havent even left yet) to ask you if you are having here and how many you would like! Like WHAT IS THE RUSH ?????? Its not like there was a really long queue?? It was so embarrassing, but i let that slide.

After i have paid, i stood there for like 30 seconds with my paynow 'successfully paid' on my phone screen, and nobody gives a flying banana about me. As im worried im blocking people behind, i eventually took my plate and left, as i thought that was a typical habit of theirs of ignoring customers.  The aunty server just kept talking to the people behind me on what they want. I just want to ask: AGAIN, WHAT IS THE RUSH????

While i was eating, they ran over and asked me to show my payment. Rude and no manners at all.

This is by far my worst experience dining here."
"There is always queue outside the shop, so we think no harm to try out. But we are deeply disappointed. The rice which should be snowy white with strong coconut fragrance was yellowish and dry. You can only smell coconut if you try hard. Just the plate of rice, with one piece of fried egg, some ikan bilis, chili and one piece of cucumber costs S$4.30. Yes, considering the taste, quality and the seating (just folding tables on the street), I find it overpriced. We further ordered 2pieces of fried chicken wings, one piece of luncheon meat, 2 shares of long beans, 2 otahs, and $4 bowl of curry vege and the total price is S$32+ for 4 of us. It is cheap considering the food price of Singapore but expensive after trying out the food taste and quality. The curry vegetable is too watery and not much taste. Most disappointing is the following late evening I had diarrhea. This morning I already went toilet twice. Because of hot weather, food with coconut can be highly dangerous. Please take caution."
"Not nice, don't like it"
Hard to get tables
"I usually don't like to give bad reviews, but honestly, I need to put this out there so that you can make an informed decision if you want to eat here. I will tell you what I ordered first. My meal consists of the ""coconut"" rice, a slice of cucumber, a fried egg, 2 ikan selar(small fishes), ikan bills(anchovies), 1 otak-otak(grilled fish paste wrapped in banana leaf, sambal and eggplant. All these for $10.10.
The ""coconut"" rice is such a disappointment.  How can you sell Nasi Lemak when your main ingredient lack flavour? I can hardly taste the coconut in it. For the price I paid, I expected more slices of cucumber, but it is okay, I can still live with that. The fried egg was good as it is runny on the inside, just how I like it. The ikan selar was crispy, also how I like it. Now the anchovies was also crispy, but it was tough the point where I could taste the bitter burnt. The otak-otak was alright. And lastly, the sambal. It wasn't to my palate. Lacked of umami and a little sweetness. I understand that sambal taste may differ from everyone, but give it a try. You may like it, and also there is no other chilli available. The eggplant was a 'meh' in my opinion. So overall, not a good dining experience. They should take a page out of Malaysia's nasi lemak that comes in this small tiny packet that cost about RM2-3. That is the kind of flavouring that PNL should live up to. If you have never tried it before, I would encourage you to try it."
As usual great food. Never disappoints
"Food quality is quite bad. Fried chicken are not juicy at all and also the rice taste very plain. The staff are also very rude, anyhow name call customer loudly. I think this franchise lost the passion to do the business anymore."
"$7.6 for my plate of Nasi lemak and self chosen ingredients. First time trying this branch. Chicken wing standard lose to jalan Besar branch and kovan branch. Attitude of staff is quite bad. I visited the shop at 440pm on a Saturday, 14 June 2025. Short Q and plenty of seats available."
"Grew up eating from Jalan Besar and Kovan outlets. Came to the main outlet, expecting that they will perform just as well as, if not better. However, the rice today just did not have the Lemak taste, and were clumpy. To me, the rice has to taste like coconut rice no matter what. Sides were ok. Sticking to my tried and tested Jalan besar branch from now on."
all in all the wings are good. And that's that.. oh and a long lost service of cleaning up after you finish dining...
"The food is good. However, queue can be long sometimes."
"The eating tables are poorly maintained. Both legs were bitten badly by sandflies. Not sharing any photos here, as it'll put off viewers. The owner needs to do some massive hygiene cleanup."
"Food portions kinda small, and it's getting real ex."
"Nice chicken wings! Nice otah! Nice curry vegetables! Yummy!

Just too expensive "
food is quite expensive
"Great late night food, bit pricey but worth for the quality. Love everything from there."
Best nasi lemak and best fried chicken I have had
Unfriendly aunty who served. Busy talking about previous customer ( who ordered 1 plate to share). Not even her business. Ended up giving me and my bf such a minion portion of brinjal. Very unhappy. Portion not so little in the past. The only thing she gave alot was the chili!
"2 chicken wings take away in Brown paper bag is $4.1 now! Not only the wings are already above average price,they hv the audacity to charge 10cents for that brown paper bag ...OMG !!"
My 7 bucks nasi lemak combo. Always come here to tabao for staffs if factory need OT. Very full. Lots of rice and egg well fried.
Good place for a quick craving of Malaysian food
"All foods are generally nice, and prices are reasonable. Nothing much to complain about; it is definitely one of the best places for nasi lemak in Singapore."
Always a classic. Always a craving!! Only it has started getting rly expensive & crowds haha
"$6 for this and a sour puss grump attitude by the staff... I think I will bring my business elsewhere given that this nasi lemak chain is now getting too big for its britches... food is also meh/mid whatever you want to call it, its not something thats to die for so better to just eat at better nasi lemak spots... thank you next"
BUSSIN NASI LEMAK
My comfort food :)
Simply Good for any occasion. My kids love the Chick Wing. Don't miss the sambal heni if you love spicy.
"Went to the Tanjong Katong branch. The selection of dishes are great and fresh.  The rice and chilli is just ok, rice can be more fragrant, chilli can be a tad sweeter. Must have is the ikan bilis and chicken wings. Queue is long but wait is not too bad but ordering process can be improved if customers can have a better view what they are ordering. Some have to order at the counter where you can't really see the dishes."
"Come here for the food, bear with the service of the counter."
Overrated and service is horrible. Serverig lady expect us to be super quick and making faces. where we go option only to see the iteams from the side.
Q ok. Fast and steady flow.
"Love the food here, really fragrant rice and crispy chicken. Usually request for the runny eggs with otah and vegetables as well. Chilli is tasty and goes well with the food. Would definitely recommend. However prices are a tad on the high side."
The best nasi lemak so far..
Like that for $9.40. Very expensive. Feel like not worth the price. Ordered the vege but only got a few.
Good nasi lemak
"Haven't had this in years, the food became so bad. Tasteless rice, pricy and super salty chicken mid wings. All the staff look like thay lost alot of money in casino.
What's even weirder is they fried tons of chicken wings and eggs 15 mins before closing, and they only open at 430pm the next day?
Bad."
I think the queue speaks for the food quality and taste. The chicken wings are a must and the curry vegetables are quite awesome
We ordered 2 plates of nasi lemak for $18! They charged $4.20 for 3 tiny mid wings. $1.50 for 3 pieces of small egg plants etc. The food here is good but they are starting to charge ridiculously. The portions are so small. Really disappointed!
Lovely food.
"Affordable and delicious nasi lemak. However, the line can be quite long during peak hours."
"This is definitely my go to place for nasi lemak.  Food standards is always good regardless which branch you visit but today's visit was a total turn off. I was trying to walk closer to the display so that I can point to the server which vegetable I wanted as there were a variety on display. The server (a foreign lady with many gold jewellery) insisted that I return to the front of the cashier counter to order. I'm not sure why is she so inflexible about it. If I could see all the dishes clearly why would I even take the effort to walk over in the first place. She was also rude to other customer behind me insisting where each of them should be standing. She is definitely not out to serve. She needs retraining to serve and rather speak to customer better. If not for the quality of food, I'm sure many customer will not return for her bad attitude and service."
"Can't help but wonder why the servers' attitude are so bad when they obviously have enough staff and business is so-so, not like there is a super long queue.

The way it's operated... don't make sense! I queue up to purchase, but the dishes are not displayed in front of me but rather... on the left side of the shop. I walked over to check out the dishes and the server urge me to come back to the front to order... seriously.... what's the rush??????

Anyone with common sense, would know that dishes should be easily seen by patrons so that it's easier to pick the choice right? Even a non famous mix rice store will know that... duh...

After me and my BF consumed the nasi lemak that night (9 Dec 2024)... both of us had sign of food poisoning, diarrhoea and vomiting for 2 days and we are still having cramps as I write this review....

Thumbs down Ponggol Nasi Lemak @ Tanjong Katong."
Great food and prices are reasonable.  Like the fried hae bee hiam and the signature deep fried chicken wings.
"To the auntie or uncle that fries the chicken wings... I love you. Even if you're not in the mood to each much, just get the chicken wing. Crispy and juicy and tbh kinda unbeatable."
One of the best nasi lemak
"We've been regulars at this stall for almost 10 years but today's meal was shockingly poor. The rice was soggy & lacked their signature coconut fragrance, veggies were overcooked & had strong taste of MSG. And the sambal portion was ridiculously small. Even our fave achar tasted bland. The queue today was also really short making me wonder if others had the same experience & stopped going...

What happened??!! So disappointed."
"Food is tasty, so many choices for you to choose. Be ready to que and stand too long coz so many people who wants to eat here. I like the chicken"
"Been eating here for years, try to dine in as much as possible to enjoy the best chicken wing flavour."
Nice place for food. Price is mass market local food.
Think the service can be better. The crowds more focus on the food rather than other stuff. I like the drumstick and eggs.
Nice comfort food. Will always crave this once in awhile
Photo shows the quality!
Food is always good especially the chilli and rice is fragrance.. But slightly expensive nowdays
"Finally had chance to revisit Punggol Nasi Lemak. Their queue is still consistently long but it moves pretty fast. We did both dine in and takeaway. Dishes wise their standard pretty comsistent. But sadly their food temperature is not right. Especially the rice, it was less than room temperature. Later we noticed new batch of rice and dishes came out hot. Perhaps just bad timing?"
"$6.30 for this plate - 1 egg, small scoop of curry vege, 1 fried wing. Portion is small and taste is average, costly meal. Took picture of vege beside 2 cut cucumber for portion reference, wing beside a spoon. Efficient  order taking set up. Plenty of fans around the tables."
"The place when you are craving comfort food. Like the fried chicken, french bean and anchovy "
Good food. Brought my vietnamese mother in law to eat nasi lemak for the first time and she loves it!!
"$12.80 for this nasi lemak. It's not cheap for sure but it hits the spot for supper. Everything is pretty average in general, nothing amazing, but not bad either."
"this place just sucks your thumbs literally, no queue management, everybody are just choping seats everywhere even they have not even queued up for their food leaving those queuing with food trays without seats, opening up so many lines but with no proper purpose just irritates and spoiling your meal, service shucks big time! imagine queing at your 2nd cashier point, paying $$$ but no cutleries, so have to walk back at your 1st cashier point for cutleries, at this moment, my both trays of food were left unattended with the next customer ordering with the droplets of saliva entering the food, how freaking disgusting is this, very disappointing, immediately walked off, would you not!"
"Well, the first thing is that you should avoid weekends and the evenings because that time the queue is a little longer. Maybe takes about like 30 minutes.
By the food wise is very fresh and tasty, and it's always crowded, but you always find enough space to have food there so nothing to worry about

Experiences, amazing because it's just by the road and you get the full experience of the authentic Nasi lemak.
You can get drinks as well as there is a washroom or hand wash area so I'm in altogether. It's a nice place to have a meal"
"Food okok la, just nasi lemak, fried chicken not bad. Just super long que..."
The best nasi lemak I ever had
"I enjoyed their food. Open at 430pm and yet the queue is already starting. Food is fresh. I definitely recommend this place. The nasi lemak, the beans, and the eggplant are so good!"
My fav supper/late dinner spot... Just order everything.. not a place to scrimp on nasi lemak dishes
"Great food, fast service, great value!
Short on seatings."
Food standard at this location is always consistent. Service is prompt and efficient and tables are cleaned quickly to ensure that people will always be able to find a table soon. Slightly more expensive than other nasi lemak store but quality is good and that's why there's always a queue for food. It also means things are always fresh and hot.
"this has to be the most over-rated nasi lemak. honestly, it is just ok, nothing to shout about. it's so overprice, u can get it in any hawker centre or coffeeshop much cheaper & taste better."
Go early if you want to avoid the crowd.
"Just one fried egg and rice is already $3. expensive and prices keep increasing. small portion of food. rice portion is very little, please at least give more portion to justify for your price."
"Special place for a Singaporean nasi lemak.   There is always a queue, but the service is fast.  No nonsense service."
"Most over-rated 'famous' nasi lemak. The rice has a tinge of nice coconut aroma but close to tasteless.  The rest (chilli, chicken, fish, egg, ikan, luncheon meat) are average. Totally not worth to q with early 20 people ahead.  Definitely not going to try again."
"This place needs no further recommendation as they are good at what they do. You will not go wrong eating here and taste has been pretty much consistent. Wait is alright even at peak hour.

Only downside would be the steep price, however for the quality. I feel that it is a worthy exchange."
Food is still nice as usual. Bought 8 chicken wings to add on 
Great nasi lemak with variety of dishes. A tad expensive though!
"Nasi lemak here is always very fragrant and flavorful, will always hop at the chance to buy when the queue isn't long, been eating here for years and definitely will not stop."
Food is good but just don't expect you have service coz too many queuing n speed is of the essence 
Nice but EXPENSIVE
"Probably the best tasting nasi lemak around, overall. The chicken wings here are the best you can find anywhere. The rice is so fragrant and the chilli is a killer. I love their sotong balls as well. Of course you have to wash it down with a bottle of soy milk in glass bottle for some nostalgia."
Fresh nasi lemak with crispy chicken!!! Never go wrong!!
Have been eating their food for the past 3 decades. Food is pricey but standard maintained
"Came here for supper on a Tuesday night after gym. If I am not wrong, there is 3 shops named ""Punggol Nasi Lemak"" in Singapore, of which 1 is in Katong, 1 in Kovan and 1 in Jalan Besar. I am not sure if they are related, but they pretty almost much sell the same kind of dishes. The one at Katong has the best standard. Rice cooked to perfection, not too hard not too soft, crispy chicken wings, tasty ikan bilis and savory lady's finger. Tried all 3 and came to this conclusion. But, I didn't quite like the chilli. The food otherwise was great."
Awesome food and great street atmosphere. For vegetarians note we checked and all items contain shrimp sauce/paste.
Overpriced and very very disappointing. Used to patronize but I'll never return again. Horrible food. Rice is bland. Chicken is not crispy and tasteless. Vegetables are stale. What is happening?
"They forgot to put chilli, the MOST important part of Nasi Lemak. Food itself is extremely overpriced. Extremely stingy with the portions. All of this cost $10..."
"Overpriced for average tasting Nasi lemak. Ordered 2 packets with only 2 standard items which you can get from any Nasi lemak stall, except for the achar. Average out to $6.30 per pack for just 2 items each. Cannot imagine if ordered a standard 3 item. Btw, even the cucumber slice was inconsistent. One pack had 3 pieces, the other had only 1!

The receipt was not comprehensive as it only stated prices. Don't know the cost of each item. I understand it is more complicated/time consuming to program individual items into the cashing machine, but it makes us guess how much each item cost.

I was given only 1 packet of chilli for 2 packs of food so I asked cashier why is this so, he hastily answered it is enough as it was a big packet. Fair enough but his body language and tone was : Please pay and don't ask questions so he can proceed to the next customer. No time to explain too much. Thus I decided not to ask him to explain the bill.

In conclusion, I would rather buy from a Macik that has 3 items: a chicken wing, eggs, anchovies & nuts at $4-$4.50. Won't be visiting them anytime soon unless I have no choice and am willing to pay premium for average food."
"Here you get to choose your ingredients, like in economic rice (caifan). I love the small chicken wings, ebi, and otah. The rice and sambal is fragrant too. It can get very crowded so I eat early, as soon as it opens. I think the portion size is quite small compared to the price. It is delicious but I wish it would be cheaper."
Probably the best nasi lemak I've eaten. Usually a queue but it moves fairly quick. Worth a detour to eat here
"yo there, as a malaysian and first time visit to singapore. i was excited to try your version of nasi lemak and heard of this place from one of zermatt's video. sadly it did not live up to the hype, every single dish i tried, there's a better, more flavorful, cheaper version in malaysia. the wings cannot compare to traditional rendang, kunyit or ayam berempah.. it is crunchy tho ill give you that, and slightly burnt. the rice is fragrant but that's about it. brinjal lacks sambal, list goes on. i honestly think a roadside nasi lemak stall in malaysia alone is multiple times better than this.

is this the best singapore has to offer? i certainly hope not. fellow malaysian try at your own expense (my total bill after conversion is roughly rm40)"
"Super crispy chicken, super yum sambal, super yum coconut rice...everything here tastes incredible! Just be ready to queue up for a while and seats are not guaranteed!"
Must try when visiting the area. Coconut rice very tasty . Spent 7.7 for the food and 2.5 for beverage
"Top list of my favorite Singapore food. Straightforward, nothing fancy and a gastronomic stunner. Queue is always long but absolutely worth your patience. They have many choices of food, none is better than the other- they are all straight out delicious!"
Benjamin Yap Jia Long
"Standard has dropped considerably. Portions were small. Expensive 7.80 for 2 veg, 1 egg and 1 chicken wing"
"2 small fish, egg, curry veg and chicken wing cost $8+.  Nasi lemak is like economy rice, cheap ingredients, they are suppose to be affordable for common folks. Not worth it, no matter how good it taste, not saying it taste very gd, 4/5 for taste. Oh and ikan bilis with peanuts should come with, never a chargeable dish. Hence the 3stars."
"Best place for nasi lemak with good servers, plenty of options with good taste, esp like their veges."
"This outlet opens until 11.30 that's why we went here after went home from a concert. The queue is long but it's all worth thr queue.
The rice is so fragrant, rich in flavor, and texture is just right. Top it up with as many dishes as you want but the mandatory ones are : chicken wings, luncheon, vegetable curry and the egg. The ikan bilis is also quite nice. Eat it with the sambal too. Price is reasonable too."
"It's worth going all the way, wherever you area. Best nasi lemak ever! Tastiest brinjal, ebihiam, and otah! Sambal is "
"Amazing nasi lemak, a tad pricey. But chicken is really crispy shiok"
My go to whenever I feel like a nasi lemak. But recently the chicken wings size has shrunk :( since we are paying a premium please bring back bigger wings
Slightly more expensive than hawker centre prices but the taste has always been good. Queues start forming when closer to peak hours as usual. The design of the toilet door isn't that friendly for some people.
"As expected, long queue.

Their Chicken Wings is a MUST TRY. And there are varieties of dishes to choose to. Overall, the foods are good. They give chili generously. "
Was great before now rice and dishes are oily
"One of the best nasi lemak in Singapore! Chicken is extremely crispy, rice is very fragrant, Ikan billis are crispy and aromatic. Everything good about a nasi lemak is in this nasi lemak. Definitely would recommend

Queue moves fast as well so do not be scared by the long queue."
Rice does not have enough coconut taste. Egg is not runny type.
"Worth queuing up to get the treat.  The rice is  flavourful. Othah and sambal chilli sauce was a good combination, with ikan blis and achar for a truly Singapore food experience."
chicken wings are tasty ! Being politely served .
"Punggol nasi lemak never fails to impress! Usually have the one at upper Serangoon, but tried the Tanjong Katong one this time and it was great too! Location was much better! It's more airy and spacious here! There was a queue that moved pretty quickly too! Will be back for more!"
Overrated and overpriced (for a hawker stall). Enough said.
About the most hyped and worst chinese version of Nasi Lemak ever.wont recommend it at all
Ding Qi De niShi betakunatutesimau
"Al fresco dining, the food always hits the spot *"
My favourite food and place to eat in Singapore yummy yummy
Super expensive
I have eaten this food since im young but today very disapointed with the service. The old auntie who always give chili talk bad about me when im asking more chili. Whats wrong with asking more chili ?? For sure wont be back again ! Thank you
Choose your own ingredients nasi lemak. Chicken wing is a must try. Rice is fragrant and curry vegetable and otak(curry fish meat) are nice as well.  Slightly pricey. Would prefer my fried items to be hotter or at least warm.
"Ponggol Nasi Lemak Centre is my Choice of a good & delicious Nasi Lemak. I love the varieties of food like fried chicken, fried anchovies with sambal & fried peanuts .  Besides, there are different types of nicely fried Veggies too."
"I've eaten here a number of times and I usually take-away to eat at home. Note the new price list for 2024 (attached photo). Most of the food items saw increased prices #inflationtoday 

Food taste is consistent, but I noticed that the most recent meal has lesser rice than usual (I could not finish the rice usually). Nevertheless, I think this is the best Punggol Nasi Lemak branch for the taste and wait times. My go-to order is chicken wing (very crispy!) long beans or curry veg (quite spicy) and ikan bilis. Rice is consistently good and quite fragrant. Comes with cucumber slices and chilli (quite spicy and more than enough)."
Love everything about it. Can't get enough.
"Ponggol Nasi Lemak is a Singapore institution.

Not for the health consience, as almost everything is fried.

But really the best chilli, Nasi Lemak, and freshly fried dishes.

Must try are the Chicken Wings, fish fillet, sotong balls, chilli egg plant,

Be prepared to wait in queue to buy though."
"incredibly clean restaurant, tasty food, resonable price.
one of the must visit place in Singapore."
"Favourite place for nasi lemak in the east, although ridiculously priced. Chilli and chicken wings paired with the rice are excellent. All dishes were prepared well like the sweet ikan Bilis and vegetables were very flavourful in general. However, parking is not easy to find in the area and place is quite squeezy. Be prepared to fork out about $8-10 per pax if you want to try out different dishes.

Return trip: Still the goated nasi lemak and the chicken wings, rice chilli are to die for. All the food is general is delicious and above your usual nasi lemak standards

Closed from 6 to 15 Feb."
Great staple for the community. Always fresh and delicious.
"Everyone's taste and experience are different. Don't base your judgment solely on opinion of others especially those who gave 1 or 2 star reviews.

Been coming to Ponggol Nasi Lemak Centre in Katong everytime we visit Singapore. This store has the most variety of toppings compared to other Ponggol's stores. Line can be long particularly at dinner time (6pm onwards). It seems to be getting longer and longer  Oh no, more people have found out.  Well, I hope they'll open more stores.

We just love to be able to choose our favorite toppings to go on the nasi lemak, rather than just the same old boring ikan bilis and egg.
My favorites are the whole fried fish, chicken wing, and the luncheon meat.

Atmosphere is ok lah, not posh but it's clean and buzzing with 'energy' coz it's busy. Line moves quite quickly. Service is quick too. Hope to come back soon "
"Ine of my favourite nasi lemak place
Tasty and consistent."
"1 star for average food that costs $10.20. In my opinion, the sambal chilli is below average."
"Very long queue during dining hours, good nasi lemak especially the chilli!"
"seriously, nothing to shout about, its overpriced. u can find better nasi lemak in any neighbourhood hawker centres/ coffeeshop."
"Ponggol Nasi Lemak is always a comfort food for me and my family. Although the prices have gone up, glad to see that the quality has remained. Must try Chinese style Nasi Lemak!"
"Hen Duo Ren Pai Dui,Bu Hui Jiu

"The food is good and has a wide variety. Lots of staff there to order, but due to its popularity, there was still a short queue. Although it's late at night when I visited, the food and all ingredients are all fresh. And it's quite affordable."
"Good place to try nasi lemak around the katong area. Food is excellent. Lots of varieties, of which most of them are simple dishes of Nasi Lemak. The staff are very nice, efficient and fast. Mostly busy and long queues. I like their chilli sambal and the rice is very flavorful. I recommend this place to try if you are around the Katong area."
"Still the same 
Love that place
And the rice is better"
The food is delicious but you have to be willing to queue to get it
Friendly and delicious ~~
The service of a young male staff handing food is impatient and reprimanded me for making wrong order despite me telling him my orders
"You get to choose your veggies and meat-add ons here so if you want your nasi lemak to be a certain way, this is your place!
There was a huge queue outside the restaurant cuz of the weekend rush hour, but it was a fast moving queue as their service was quite quick. Quality of food was also great!"
Very nice nasi lemak
Good as usual. Packed with people as well
"It's consistent. You're here. You already know what you came for.

They have a system. On the left to have it there and on the right for takeaway.

Line moves pretty quick as long as the person in front of you isn't ordering 50packets.

Hits are the chicken wings, otah, egg, Ikan bilis and veg. You know the drill."
"Gan Jing Wei Sheng You Hao Chi,Sui Ran Yao Pai Dui Dan Fu Wu De Hen Kuai"
"Superbly fragrant rice, heavenly fried chicken wings and close to what I'll deem as the perfect nasi lemak chili. All the dishes here were hot and tasty, and I'd come again anyday!!"
pretty good food.
The rice is really  yummy and they have many varieties of side dishes to choose from. 
Good chinese style nasi lemak
"I sinned today! Gave in to craving and had an awesome dinner of nasi lemak. The chicken wings are to die for and wow, the chilli is darn nice. To top it off, the rice is superbly cooked. Heard that the boss actually experimented with at least 40 types of rice grains before deciding on a particular variant. Wow, talk about dedication! Worth the calories. I am happy diner today."
"Below average plate of nasi lemak. The sambal lacked taste and was sweet with a lingering hint of low quality hae bee, the dried shrimp used in making sambal. The rice was oilier than other versions of the dish found elsewhere and not fragrant with coconut smell. The brinjal and the french beans were verging on the oily side. The chicken wing was the saving grace, it was crunchy and not too overseasoned.

I came here when there was only 5 people in front of me. Had there been a queue I would have second thoughts. Its definitely not worth a second visit.
Ate"
"Good place for nasi lemak; everything is solid other than the price... which I find to be a little much given the portion. An egg, chicken wing, ikan bilis and french bean ran me 6.70
If you have money to spare and don't mind paying for a decent nasi lemak, then this may be right up your alley. However, if you want an economical meal this may not be the place to have it."
"Best nasi lemak ever. Eggplant was phenomenal. Loved the otah, super moist and soft. Long bean was tasty. Chicken wing was crispy and not oily. Chilli was quite spicy and satisfying.

Even with the queue and me accidentally hitting above $10 with the amount of ingredients I ordered, my expectations was still exceeded by far. Amazing, totally would come again, now just hoping for a branch in the west."
"There was a cleaner aunty keep asking for tips, which we find not so appropriate "
"Usually long queue when I pass by the stall, but queue was shorter today."

"Food is good...but not cheap. Service can be improved, but likely won't as they need to serve the many customers, and need to keep the Q moving."
Unhealthy food. Mostly fried items. Overpriced.
"It was one of the best fried chicken and nasi ever had in my life. We have been to this place twice during our holiday in Singapore. Our son is usually very fussy about food. But when he tried their fried chicken wings, he absolutely loved it, and he ate two full fried chicken wings by himself with rice. He usually doesn't eat that much fried chicken. We will highly recommend this place "
"You get some coconut rice and choose toppings if your choice. The chicken was amazingly crunchy and juicy. For vegetarians, the eggplant and okra were amazing as well as some fried tofu dishes."
Other outlets are way better than this outlet. Rice not much coconut taste and ingredients are not warm. Ngoh hiang is not the same as compared to the other outlets
"Nasi lemak here is quite overrated, rice isn't fragrant, sambal is subpar, and the decent fried chicken can't even save the dish. The only thing that's worse here is the attitude of most of the service staff. Disorganised, dismissive and arrogant. Not worth a visit."
"The queue is a long. make sure to secure your seats before ordering if you're dining in.

Before my turn auntie called me if I'm going to dine in or takeaway.

During my turn, I point out all of the food that will go into my nasi lemak and pay the total.

The rice has the right texture and taste.
(the other stores are too aggresive on how they flavor their rice)
The sunny-side egg cooked perfectly.
They weren't kidding about their chili being spicy.
The veggie curry is delicious.
The chicken wing was okay.

Overall it was a great experience."
Great food at affordable prices. Open till late to 1130pm
"Overpriced and overrated.
Rice does not have the lemak fragrance. Side dishes are normal and average deep fried frozen stuff.
Made up by friendly auntie clearing tables.
Ok for convenience but will not recommend if one is looking for good old tasting nasi lemak with the traditional lemak fragrance."
"Standard dropped. The rice is very different now. The rice is a bit sticky and it doesn't have the aroma of what nasi lemak rice should have. Very disappointed. Dishes still ok, not fantastic."
"Cash only, no paynow, no card."
"Although it's long q, but normally moving quite fast. Love their egg, look at that perfection! Their fried chicken is nice too! Ebi is so so, maybe not much ppl order, so it's cold alr.
Highly recommend!"

A place to go for nasi lemak if you are not super hungry cos the queue can be quite scary at time.
"my go-to nasi lemak place, i've been going here for over a decade. always so good."
"Bought food from them, but the lady at the drinks counter told me she is doing accounting, no selling of drinks.:("
They have improved the chilli and it is spicier which makes it nicer
Great food at a reasonable price! It's a must eat!
"The place is always clean, the food is always good, the people is always nice and  the queue is always long  "
Chicken wings are still decent after all these years.
"Best Nasi Lemak yet! Great quality of food items that command their price for the value. Wide variety of side dishes allow for a high degree of customization. Want vegetarian, you got it. Want fish and chicken, you got it too.

Only caveat is that the process can be a bit confusing to an outsider. They will ask for your order in this process:

1)takeout of dine in?
2)how much rice?
3) which dishes?

Staff were very friendly and helpful, and even though we worked with an accent-language barrier and I did not know the process, they were patient and willing to explain.

Highly recommended for anyone liking nasi lemak!"
"Other than the tasty, hot chilli, it's not exceptional. Small serving. Expensive!"
Highlight is the chicken wing and chilli. Be prepared for long queues even though service is relatively quick. Price is reasonable as well.
"I enjoy the crisp crunchy chicken wings.
The 0cra is fried with sambalishness.
Even the egg is fried with 0range lava
Within and it gives the lavishness taste
As you sink your teeth into it. And the
Archar is spuced with spiciness n the
Pineapple just taste just good. Carry
On makan."
Amazing food! Wish i had more room in my stomach!
"Don't really understand why people would queue so long in the early evening for this nasi lemak, when this place is clearly meant for supper!

What better vibes than to sit in a traditional shophouse by the roadside, under a palm tree, with natural (though warm) ventilation, and eating a delicious local meal late at night.

This place used to be so expensive, but now everywhere else is so expensive that it justifies the price they are charging. Food is delicious and consistent. Pretty high in calories but great to indulge once in a while."
Rice was hard. Curry veg very bland. Fried stuff tasted of reused oil... Overall pretty disappointing considering it is quite hard to fudge up nasi Lemak and Fried food?
Amazing food
"Very sedap nasi lemak. Love the chicken wings,ngoh hiang and otah . What make it special is their chilli. However there is always a long que ."
"Long queue warning! But guarantee super satisfaction with probably the best nasi lemak in town! Everything on the dish is superb from the peanut and ikan bilis, the fragrant rice, the deep fried chicken to die for, the excellent sambal to top it off. The only item can't match other places is the otah. They don't have the superb drumstick like the Capitol branch. We reach at 5:30 for dinner thinking it's shorter queue but it's already snaking long! We went back at 8:40 and it's shorter with 20mins wait. Worth the wait every time!"
Just know that the sambar is spicy it could burn ur tongue
"Went there at 4.30pm, there was no queue. Chicken wing and anchovies are the best!"

Glad I came shortly before opening time. Everything fresh and no queue!
Curry vegetables were also great 
"Must try nasi lemak, one of the best nasi lemak and open until late night"
Ultimate comfort food. You won't go wrong with ordering anything they have.
"As good as it gets.
Delicious. Super clean.
They start serving at 4.30pm till late night. Satisfaction everything. They can maintain the taste for so many years. Kudos!"
Most consistent Nasi Lemak in Singapore
"Unbelievable consistency, food quality & price."
Over rated. It is popular eating place for local Chinese. I feel it is too costly though good but not excellent
Branch of ponggol nasi lemak. Cleaner and less crowded environment.
"A pretty decent nasi lemak that is something like economy rice but with nasi lemak. Which was pretty interesting. The nasi lemak (coconut rice) is okay, although I feel that it needed abit more ohm (abit more lemak). It would also be great if the fried chicken was drumstick or tight meat instead of wings as some were quite dry and tough. Overall, I would give it a 6/10 as the other dishes and sambal were pretty good.

There's always a long line but the line moves pretty fast. Workers are all very systematic and organised to ensure that everything is in place and customers doesn't wait too long."
Not sure why there is a long queue everyday. Food is average and pricey.
The food is ok..but quit expensive
I would appreciate if the management would provide delivery service like deliveroo or grab so that the qie will be lesser. It's very frustrating to come and que especially under sun or rain. Please do something thanks
Best fried chicken wings
Chicken wing is very nice but the price is duoble of other nasi lemak stall. I pay it 21SGD+ for this 2 plate Nasi Lemak. Don't know is the staff overcharge or maybe that is their price.
"Wei Dao Huan Bu Cuo,Bi Yi Ban Ye Jiang Fan Hao Chi Jie Qian Ye Bi Yi Ban Ye Jiang Fan Gao. "
"Prices are high. Let's get that out of the way.
Chicken wings are good, sunny side up eggs have gooey centre (good). Everything is crispy even when cold. Went near last order so can confirm that they do let the food turn cold."
"Long queue and very overpriced of $30 for 3 plates (each with double chicken wings, kuning fish and eggs.) 2 of the plates missing eggs and Ikan bilis but I didn't noticed until we started eating. Overall experience not great and I think with the price, there are many other better options of nasi lemak in Singapore."
Legendary nasi lemak di SG... Quite long Q.
"I was given 3-5 peanuts each for my $9 Nasi Lemak when I specifically asked for peanuts. See photos. I did not ask for ikan billis. This is not the first time this has happened. I come here often.

I will change my rating to 5 stars when asked. This is really uncalled for! Give me the peanuts please and thank you."
I think the food is good enough. I will not queue for this. I also think it's overpriced for what is traditionally a simple meal.
"Ponggol Nasi Lemak is not as good as it used to be.. Chicken wing used to be fragrant with every bite.. but now it seems abit bland.. prices are slightly up.. Chilli used to be good but now so so..
Maybe my tastebuds is different now but kinda disappointed in some way.."
"Very nice meal for supper. Everything is great except the queue and $$$. Parking at roadside is free but full of cars, need to wait for some time. Queue is long but can be quite fast. Highly recommended for monthly once."
One of my goto place for dinner 
Good food!!
"Brought my Hong Kong family and friends who are visiting Singapore to this place to eat today. Portion seems to be smaller and rice not as shiok as last time. Got one auntie (wearing staff shirt) kept hanging around our table, and ""joked"" about paying her if we get her help us take picture, at first we ignored, but she kept hanging around and try to start topic. My Hongkie friends couldn't take it and gave her a $2 note and she stopped disturbing us...I am really upset at this experience that my family & friends have go through"
It's a busy  place
Simply delightful
"They closed today, my fault to believe the person who just posted the review today made me think that the store is actually open, sigh"
My favourite chicken wings. Queue is always that long but staff work fast with good attitude. Nice supper place after a great badminton session
"I like not only chicken wings but also vegetables (eggplant, long bean). I will repeat eating here once or twice a week for dinner."
"Over priced coconut rice aka nasi lemak.
Did I mentioned their staff is rude too"
"they changed the chicken wing !! now it is very small, prawn stick only has half a frozen prawn."
"Hao Chi Er Qie Bu Gui,Fan Ben Shen Hen Xiang,sambalLa Jiang Hen Xia Fan Huan You Dian Tian Tian De. Jian Feng Shi Jian Ke Ren Hen Duo,Jian Yi Bi Kai. "
Fried chicken and spicy sambal
"Fragrance chinese nasi lemak.
Nice!"
Nice fried food to pair with nasi lemak!
"Crispy chicken wings are nice and very crunchy. Other than chicken wings, the rest tasted average. Long queue expected, so do go off early or avoid peak hours."
"The taste is good, but a bit pricey compare to similar dishes on other restaurants"
Taste good but please la why so stingy with the food portion lately? Not like we're not paying more for it.
"Chi Liao Hen Duo Nian De Lao Dian,Fei Chang Hao Chi,You Qi Shi Zha Ji Chi,Xiao Yu Hua Sheng,La Jiao Jiang. Lao Ban Fu Qi Shi Hen Ai Gan Jing De Ren,Suo Yi Dian Li Fei Chang Gan Jing. "
Just so good lah. I enjoyed every bite. Wings & otah plus runny egg
"Good rice, good chicken, and the long queue actually moves quite fast!"
"It's been awhile I had this all time after clubbing supper. Always super long queue at this outlet@tg Katong. So today while waiting for my takeaway Korean food, hopped over and just grab one packet with hae bee hiam, brinjal, lady fingers, fish fillet, otah & ikan billis with peanuts! Yes! Still so good when it's taken home."
Food is relatively nice but on the pricey end for nasi lemak.
Probably one of the best nasi lemak places I have been to. But it is very pricey.
"I could say this is good but the only wow factor is that their chicken wings were good the taste was savoury and crunchy. Their sambal was nice but unfortunately, in my opinion no ""wow"" factor."
"My favorite place for Nasi Lemak. Super chicken wings, otah, silver fish, sambal chilli(I usually asked for extra)... and the coconut rice too. Slightly expensive but worth it."
Food is better then other nasi lemak shops but a little expensive.
One of my favourite place for Nasi lemak. Many selections and food is nice. Chillies too
"The experience at this place was spoilt due to being overcharged. There are plenty of other great food establishments in Singapore where you're served with more honesty. No matter how good your food is (only the chicken wings was good, everything else was average) it is never right to overcharge customers."
"This is the classic, Singapore, wonderful nasi lemak. In my opinion this is the best place among all the Ponggol Nasi Lemak, with the widest variety of ingredient choices atop your fragrant coconut rice. This place operates mainly in the evening and night, and is closed on Thursdays. The queue can get pretty long especially during the dinner hour so don't be shocked by the queue. That said, the staff serve pretty fast so the queue doesn't actually take that long."
Probably the best Nasi Lemak in Singapore! I eat here every time I'm in town.
Delicious food 
usual nice fragrance food. luv their chicken wings and shrimp paste
My fav Nasi Lemak in SG.
Overrated overcharging . Charge at random. Very bad attitude too. Complacent. Arrogant.
Nasi lemak with sweet sambal is what you prefer then you can't go wrong with this. Do not miss out on their freshly fried chicken wings.
Good chicken good food
Price is reasonable and variety of dishes. One of my favourite nasi lemak.
Good food and clean place. Not crowded when we went there on a Friday evening.  Sambal very good.
Best Nasi lemak in Singapore. There's always long queue. Totally worth it
The BEST nasi lemak in SG .
"Y'all.. queue for this? Rice has a hint of fragrance, kuning hard as rocks, portions are sad, there's a queue. Chicken wing was good, I guess. But why the queue?"
"Dishonest business. Staff over charge $1 for absolutely NOTHING. Staff reply because his boss ask to collect extra $1 so he insist to collect from me & all customers. I order 2 plates so I paid $2 for nothing!!! This's daylight robbery!!! Just because they've long queue of customers, they think they've rights to rob customers.  NEVER going back to BUY from them AGAIN."

"Worse ever customer service experience! This stall hires a whole bunch of foreigners who have no manner at all and do not have proper skill to serve customer. I was told that I can only order from the spot indicated which is next to the cashier (SIDE) as the staff wont be able to hear me if i were to go to the FRONT (where you can view all the dishes) to which i reply how was I gonna decide on ingredients if I haven't seen all the dishes? The funny thing is the customer before me and after me were instructed to go the FRONT to order. Do not give funny excuse that you won't be able to hear me! If that is the case, then everyone can only order from the SIDE not FRONT. When I went to the FRONT to check what is available, I was told that I can see from the side. What is wrong with your staff? Was told that me going to the front to check out ingredients will disrupt the order. Then how am I supposed to decide when I can't see from the side and doesn't come here regularly to know all the ingredients they have. Please train your staff well with regards to how to give proper service. Food is MEDIOCRE and with TERRIBLE SERVICE like this, NOT WORTH A PENNY SPENT HERE! Wasted my $53 for 7 packs of nasi lemak. Price is also not justified for the quality served. Tourists who are considering to visit this place, be prepared to be treated with NO RESPECT by the poorly trained staff!!

Date of visit : 2 September 2022 (Friday)
Time of visit : 9.20pm
Food : 2 stars
Service : Doesn't even deserve 1 star
Price : Definitely on the high side for the simple ingredients served (it's funny that the receipt doesn't even show what we have been charged for)"
Overrated nasi lemak but Chicken wing is excellent. Crunchy & very tasty. Other dishes can improve more
Chicken wings is a must try
"It's pricey, yes, but the food is so good that it's worth it. Upsize the rice and get the fried chicken, fried egg, green beans, and sambal."
"The chicken wing tasted so bland, trusted the wings have not marinaded before dipped into the batter."
"Getting more and more expensive.
Now the Lime Juice cost $2 for cup that is 70% ice.."
"Have eaten here for years due to their consistent quality but sadly no longer the case now. Standards have dropped drastically in recent months while the price rises non-stop.

On 2 recent visits : Rice is no longer coconut-y fragrant and fluffy.. what they serve now is bland hard rice that is not pleasant at all. Eggs are no longer consistently runny like they used to be. The chili is no longer umami but just some salty concoction now.

Very disappointing."
Pretty average nasi lemak only the chicken wing is good
The coconut rice is not as flavourful.  The fried chicken  was good as it is freshly cooked.  The nasi lemak fish is cold and not so crispy.  Was surprised that they have long queue  even at around 9 pm
Rice has got a strong coconut fragrance. The spicy sambal is shiok.
"If you're a tourist in Singapore you definitely have to try this! The rice has a soft and gentle coconut flavor that goes perfectly with the sweet and spicy ""sambal"", the fried chicken is always fresh which adds a crunchy texture to the mix, I recommend the ""Ikan Bilis and peanuts"" (basically anchovies with peanuts) as a side dish for an even more complete experience! Delicious and with a spicy kick and one of my new ""all time favorites""."

This evening bought a packet consisted 2 piece of fishcakes little longbeans and rice which cost me S$5/50 cents. I think its over charged and too expensive. My advise to everybody is to check the price for what you have ordered.
Foods is great but price is a bit X
Standard has dropped. Already Overpriced and yet still Overcharged. Please send your staff for maths lesson.
Nothing special except the long queue.
"My go to nasi lemak place, they serve quality fried chicken wings, coconut rice and assorted dishes. Yes, slightly pricey but it is consistently good. My only concern is that shrinkflation is real - the chicken wings look tiny compared to last time. Maybe they're just chicks."
love this laksa
Yummy food!
Super good! wud definitely come back again
"The price was very high. Bought 3 packets which cost $23.20. Ingredients include curry cabbages, brinjal, ngoh hiang, long beans, luncheon meat, fish ball. Chilli was good but rice might not have that much coconut in themEat it yourselves and form your own opinions "
"27.06.22 / 2 pax damage $15.60
1 packet / rice,  chicken wing,  nuts ikan bilis, long beans, 2 pcs fried ngor hiong

1 packet / rice,  chicken wings,  3 ikan kuning, ladies fingers

If you think of nasi lemak, it is kinda expensive for 2 pax... but overall,  still an enjoyable dinner...

The (paid ??) chilli is the dry version n taste good.... not the burning feeling kind.."
Super busy place especially on weekends when you will find a long que of ppl for sure . Is it worth that wait?? The answer is both yes and no.... Yes - for that hype and no- since the food is nothing outstanding and extraordinary.. it's between ok to good. The otah was delicious and the rice had a lovely flavour of coconut.. the veggies and meats were ordinary.
"YUMMY! Be prepared for long queues and high prices. But if you are craving nasi lemak, this will hit the spot!"
"Three things that make or break nasi lemak:

1. The rice (must have the shiok ""lemakness"" from the coconut)
2. The sambal (spicy but not too diluted)
3. The ikan billis (crunchy and bite sized)

Ponggol nasi lemak delivers on all three fronts to a T. The bonus is their array of sides to pick from, be it the crispy and succulent chicken wings, or the elegantly done brinjal and French beans.

Come early to avoid disappointment.

#brownmanreviews"
Takeaway for supper. The ingredients were fresh and yummy. Chilli was good too. Loved the fried chicken wings and ladies fingers.
"One of the well known nasi lemak chains in Singapore. Gave the outlet in Tanjong Katong a try. It was super packed so I guess its still a favourite amongst the locals.
I ordered the chicken which was tender and cooked well. The only downside I feel like is it a bit on the expensive side."
Food yummy n service good
"The rice used to be very fragrant. But recently, it tasted more like white rice without the coconut milk fragrance & taste"
The chicken super crunchy and rice flavourful and fluffy the ikan bills goes well with the sambar little pricey but well worth it
Delicious Nasi Lemak with huge selection of Nasi lemak ingredients. Their fried chicken and sambal are yums!
"Popular nasi lemak stall, they have other branch too, but Tj Katong one is the OG place. Been here many times before pandemic hit. You can choose many toppings for your nasi lemak, my standard go always with chicken wing and fish cake. Their coconut rice and chilli sambal is the best, rice is so aromatic and fluffy. For nasi lemak, honestly the price is higher side. When I came, around 5.30pm, the queue is not so long, at that time I'm thinking this place has lost popularity, but when I finish around 6pm, the queue already snaking around, lol I guess I'm wrong, they still popular. My honest review: they still one of the best nasi lemak in sg, but.. after I tried some other nasi lemak like one in adam rd food centre, I questioned myself, is it worth it to travel far just to eat nasi lemak and then go back to city? I dunno leh.. but still 5 stars for them as they can maintains their quality of nasi lemak."
Their chicken wings are one of the best. 
Best Nasi lemak 
"I think it's better to eat on the spot, instead of packing it home. Take note the nearby roadside parking is *not* available during peak hours (7am to 8:30am, and 5pm to 7pm) as the sign is badly blocked and barely visible!"
"Awesome nasi lemak. There is a long queue at all times, but the service is quick and efficient. Probably one of the best chicken wings I have had so far. Everything is amazingly fresh and tasty. Loved it."
"My favourite Chinese Nasi lemak franchise!

The queue is always along especially during peak hours. The pricing is definitely around 40 to 50% more expensive than ordinary nasi lemak stores. But personally, I believe the taste is worth the price. I still hope they would lower the prices though. Lol

This branch, as in the taste slightly loses to the one, compared to Serangoon (which I think is the original branch). The services at this branch is better though.

This plate of my Nasi lemak (see photo) costed me $5.80. You judge. But I still enjoyed it anyway.

They should open more branches or franchises all over Singapore! :D"
lovely fragrant nasi lemak and love the juiciness of the chicken. still one of the best in my opinion in Singapore
"The best Nasi Lemak,"
"Returned on a Wednesday night to try this nasi lemak after seeing long snaking queues on a Sunday evening.

The queue moved quite quickly, and I didn't wait more than 15 mins to order my food on Wednesday. The tables are self service but promptly cleared and cleaned by the staff. It was a pretty clean place for a coffeeshop.

The coconut rice was fragrant and adequately moist to my liking. The okra and eggplant were each a garlic and shallot stir-fry, and paired very well with the flavours of the sambal chilli and coconut rice. The smoky otah and crispy fish fillet were as good as they come.

The 2 veg and 2 meat cost me almost $7.50, which is a little pricey given the size of the vegetable portions (I wish there was more of the eggplant!). Note that ikan bilis and peanuts are considered as a dish; only a slice of cucumber and sambal chilli(I asked for more) is given by default."
"Been here and ate here many times, nice variety of dishes, only issue is not super healthy unless u choose the vegetable options!"
"Wonderfully fragrant nasi lemak that emanates notes of pandan and jasmine through the air. You can smell the coconut wafting through the air from the streets.

Chicken wings, chilli, and ikan bilis are the star of the show. The wings give way under a satisfying crunch, sambal is rich, smokey, and spicy. The ikan bilis is light and crunchy.

Service is incredibly fast, everyone is proficient at their jobs and the queue clears fast despite people taking away large orders.

Prices are steep, too steep for nasi lemak, paid $16+ for 2."
"This is the best Nasi Lemak I've had in my life. The food is great, the staff are extremely nice and efficient. I go here at least once a week"
Delicious nasi lemak
Like their freshly cooked Nasi Lemak and their side dishes.
Crispy fried chicken and nasi 
nasi lemak you wouldnt want to miss!!!
All the dishes are quite nice. Just that the servings are small and a bit expensive. Long queue during dinner peak hours.
Dinner tonight costs SGD 18 plus for 2 plates of nasi lemak with a wide variety of dishes. The food quality is also worth the price and the sambal chilli is a must have whenever I order the food here. The food is always served fresh and warm. However today the curry cabbage is cold though.
Getting more pricy and not as good as before
getting too expensive
"This place has a perpetual queue in line during lunch & dinner. Been visiting for a number of years. Quality of food has been consistent. Prices have been rising.

Visited last night with family for early dinner to avoid long queue. Was 2nd in line & was served quickly. 3 plates of nasi lemak with 3 dishes each came up to almost $20 ( excluding drinks). That's a Hugh increase over these few months.

To add to the woes, the rice was disappointing, not as fragrance with the lemak, rice was not fluffy like before, not hard but not soft.

If the rice texture and flavour continues, it really not worth visiting anymore."
One of the best nasi leak in Singapore. Revisited Feb 2022.
Very nice. Chicken wing and sambal are very nice. Will cone again.
"I'll give 5 star for the food but 1 star for the how the staff take orders. You would assume when you point at the fish and prawn, you only want 1 pc each, just like chicken wing. Turns out they took 2 prawns and 2 fish on one packet of rice.

It's very hard to see what the food handler pick from the position im asked to stand. Will it hurt to ask me? Just heck care take and charge the customer as much as they can."
Had their takeaway. I think their Nasi lemak is one of the best in Singapore. Always long queue. But their queue clears fast.
The chicken wing is a must try.
Once a while will buy this to satisfy nasi lemak craving.  Won't always eat cos of fried stuff.  Pricing is on the higher side but once a while eat is ok.
Super clean place. Food is excellent but a bit expensive
So yummy u will want to come back soon for more!
Nice nice nice
"A bit on the pricey end, but definitely worth what you are paying for.

Rice and chilli are fragrant and delicious. Chicken wing is well cooked and crispy.

The queue is generally long so be ready for it. Overall, it is a great place for nasi lemak!"
"Does everything as what a nasi lemak should be, gd execution but expected more for the price paid!"
Rude staff. Small portion.
Expensive but the coconut rice are great.
Loved the food and the staff was very friendly and approachable. The food is exactly what you want when you're looking for a fix of nasi lemak
The sambal very good taste. And spicy. The Acar very nice. You can try it. Very delicious
Expensive af
Two plates $15. The hei bee is good. Rice not as pungent as previously
4 stars for its fragrant cocunut pandan rice and chilli sauce! And also for their variety of dishes that are available.
"Not sure why the long queue. Maybe my expectation for Nasi lemak is high as I have tried Nasi lemak regionally in Malaysia and Indonesia (Nasi uduk). A good plate of Nasi lemak-The rice must be fragrant w the pandan and moist w the coconut... Sambal is too dry and sweet hence must have a drink to swallow. Ordered the fried chicken, can't compare to the lemon grass fried chicken I had in Malaysia and Indonesia during my travel days. For $9 bucks per plate.. I ordered fried chicken and otak2... I came out disappointed"
Still as yummy especially the fragrant of the rice and fried chicken.
"Fresh, full of variety and affordable"
"Very bad service and dont even has a safe entry check in machine. Shop owner blame it to government. For your own health, better dont visit this shop."
Fast and good food!
"Kids love the fried chicken, hubby loves the rice, i love the chili and bringal"
Not exactly the best in Singapore and the price is quite expensive. Expect to que for a while as well.
Nasi lemak chicken is crispy and yummy
"Branded Nasi Lemak in SG. For me tasted So So only... There are many Nasi Lemak around SG tasted better than this brand. Very expensive too. I ordered 2 Veg, 1 Oatah and ikan bilis, lime juice total $8.10. First and Last time for me."
Better nasi lemak compared to other place. Things to be noted is thier sambal was good and chicken was crispy enough 
The only Nasi Lemak that I think is Nasi Lemak so far. The sambal & coconut rice is definitely sitting on the next level standard compared to others. Love it!
"First time here. Queue moves as fast as it forms. Staff was friendly and prompt to recommend. The ngoh hiong was tastyOverall a delicious early dinner though the steeper price tag was already expected. Also takeaway. Their chicken wings.  The premise is very clean by most eatery standards.  Will come again.   Visited on a Saturday, 5:55pm."
All time favorite nasi lemakBest in Singapore
"No more longtong vegetables at late hours :(
Think they don't serve chicken thighs there."
"The quality of the food here is amazing! Been a regular for 4+ years now, and we still keep coming back at least 2-3 times a week! Never getting sick of punggol nasi at tanjong katong's outlet. Friendly staff too:)"
"Fan Hen Xiang,Ji Chi Bang Hen Cui,La Jiao "
Decent plate of nasi lemak. Prices abit on the high side.
"An above average plate of Nasi Lemak -

That fluffy aromatic pandan leaf scented coconut rice hits you hard; complemented by a fragrant spicy and sweet fried shrimp Sambal Chilli (Hae Bee Hiam Sambal) at the side to help activate your tastebuds, and that crunchy battered chicken wing. These are the makings of a great plate of Nasi Lemak that help Ponggol Nasi Lemak stand out from its competition.

Other sides were also well executed. The well seasoned egg with a runny yolk centre, that 5 spiced pork roll wrapped in crunchy fried beancurd skin (Ngoh Hiang) and that pan fried beansprout with dried shrimp chilli paste.

There are also a wide variety of other choices available, like their Otah (spicy fish cake wrapped in Pandan leave) and curry vegetables that burst with flavour.

The only disappointment to that plate was that the side dishes (the vegetable, Ngoh Hiang and chicken wing) were served cold (could be due to the colder rainy weather at night). But of course at this price point (my plate was $7.90), it would be good if the food can be kept warm. Hope the stall owners consider adding heating lamps/convection stoves at the food display counter to keep the food warm.

All and all it would have been 5/5 for the flavours, but despite falling short from the colder dishes, it still deserves a 4/5 for this great plate of Nasi Lemak."
"One of the best nasi lemaks in Singapore .

Quality of food lagi best la, portions served are big, made with the freshest ingredients. Lemak flavor is strong in the rice and staff always provides service with a smile.

Will definitely return"
"Really good. The fried chicken, long beans and otah are a must"
Rice is fragrant and fried chicken is crispy & juicy. Chilli is also good! Overall great!
"Went to buy and take away during Covid-19 height restrictions. As always, the attitude was extremely poor and rude. Service quality was worse. Requested to help cut the chicken wing which takes less than 30 seconds to do it. But rudely replied they don't help customers cut the chicken wing. They just want to quickly have you paid for the food and get out of their sight. The new branch at Jalan Besar offers much better food quality and the service is so much better than at 238 Tanjong Katong branch. Don't bother to buy at Tanjong Katong branch. Food quality standard has dropped significantly."
"I could catch a whiff of pandan aroma from afar as i came to the shop. It was just so tempting. There was a short queue starting to build 15 minutes after its opening in the afternoon. Service was quick and it took only 10 minutes when my turn came. The fried chicken wing was a must, and not to ignore the anchovy peanuts. This was the umpteenth time that i came for this fast and convenient dinner. I always went away satisfied. Yummy..."
Very good nice to eat.
"Food is good. Even though long que, but their service is fast. Nice and friendly staffs."
"A lot of people complaint their food is pricey and the food taste average etc. But the queue is always very long; it doesn't make sense.

Why? Because their food is good and their food preparation standard are maintained at a high standard. Plus, the place is spotless (I suspect the owner has OCD ); their lights and fans are dust-free (don't believe? please drop by and take a look for yourself)

I recommend their ah char (can be slightly on the spicy side), otah, fried chicken wings (super crispy) and fried Ikan Bilis (sweet and crispy).

If you are first time visiting here, do head over to the food counter first to take a look before joining the queue."
"If you know what real nasi lemak is, you'll know that this is not even close to being the real thing unfortunately. This is more economy rice with sambal on the side than nasi lemak."

ABIT over price
"Delicious nasi lemak, will come back for more !"
"After Phase 2(Heightened Measures), sudden craving for nasi lemak! Where else to head to but Punggol Nasi Lemak! Always the best, nice consistency rice and sambal to die for!"
"Not the best nasi lemak, but they serve really good fried chicken. Rice wasn't fragrant. Service was not good either, esp the server at the serving station."
"Superb, quality and serving of food was good. I also noticed the premises was kept clean, can visit them to order takeaways, thanks."

"Food is tasty & Chicken wing is crispy
Nasi lemak must try"
Rice was not very flavorful. Chicken was amazing. Just okay.
One of the best Nasi Lemak I had. Worth the price and the wait
The chicken wing and ikan teri 
Quite overpriced.
Nothing extraordinary. Just very deep fried food using cheap oil. Fried stuff is addictive but if you are health conscious and want to be free of illnesses avoid this place.
One of the best nasi lemak u can find in sg.
Jue Dui Bang
One of the best nasi lemak. Curry veg is a must try.
"Great place for supper. The coconut rice is fragrant and they offer a range of food including curry vegetable, fried shrimps, sambal okra, and many more. The chili is fragrant and savoury that pairs well with the food. The chicken wing is fried to perfection and stays crispy for a good hour if you plan to pack some home"
"Food is Tasty and satisfy. Standard has generally maintained over time. Service sometimes has to be a compromise. Once u are at the counter and if the q is long, have to quickly and decisively make your selection before u are given a face."
"EVERY MEAL IS A WORK OF ART. WITH EVERY BITE I TAKE, I HAVE TO PAUSE FOR A FEW SECONDS TO GIVE A MOMENT OF SILENCE JUST TO APPRECIATE AND GIVE THANKS FOR THE MASTERPIECE OF A MEAL BEFORE ME. HOW COULD YOU NOT GIVE 5 STARS.

CHICKEN WING IS A MUST."
"Strangely, the place was closed on a Tuesday night at 8plus, before their official closing time. Hope they can be mindful about updating their operating hours on their social media pages."
Really good food. Service equally good. Very clean environment. Will recommend all to visit the store.
"Taste : OK only
Value for food : expensive

Must eat : Fried chicken"
Nice yummy 
This is probably the most authentic nasi lemak you can find in SG - all dishes are freshly prepared. Their chicken wings are the best  Queues are always v long but it moves pretty fast as service is v efficient. Highly recommended.
"Freshly cooked ingredients, and very fragrant rice.
The chicken wing is the most shiok, crunchy battered skin!
Highly recommended "
"$10 for fried chicken wing, otah, brinjal, long bean, egg, 2 pc of chilli chicken wing, rice.

Chilli chicken wing was too spicy and did not enjoy it. Everything else was good.

Not 5 star because considering most places are going cashless and I did not have enough cash with me. Had to paynow a customer to get cash as the nearest atm was quite far away according to the staff."
Love the fragrant of rice...
Don't know what happened? So much hype. Don't mind the price but rice was bland and chicken wing no taste but sugar sprinkled on just did it for me.
definitely worth it
The food here never disappoints. Friendly staff too. Price of course higher than normal. The vegetable curry is a must try.
Food was delicious as usual. But for take away they shouldn't used styrofoam box because I realised the freshly fried chicken wings was too hot and it left burn mark on the styrofoam box which I reckon it will be harmful. Would appreciate the owner to look into this matter.
"Used to frequent this place alot but i found during my recent visits, the rice is not as fragrant anymore. I miss the coconuty flavour of the rice before! Chicken wings still one of the must trys though."
"Best ever local food in Singapore!
All made everyday fresh.
Is always busy so the food quality is good.
The owner always around take care and keep the place clean.
Staff are friendly.
Food is cheap and delicious.
"
A perfect plate of nasi lemak.
Love the rice. All dishes is awesome.
"The best nasi lemak I have tried. Disclaimer: I am not a fan of nasi lemak. This stall is always long queue. Today I came in a weekday before 6pm. Just nice! The queue starts when it reaches six.

The rice was full of fragrance of coconut. Definitely cooked with coconut milk.

The dishes were still warm. I hate it when some stall serves the cold or not that warm dishes. I felt eating leftover food if the dishes are not warm or hot.

All the dishes was good tasted and the prepared it freshly as the turn over rate was high. The chicken wing was good. Crispy skin and well marinated meat inside."
pricey but great nasi lemak
"Long queues because customers are taking away for like 5/6 pax, ordering 5/6 pax worth of food. Doesn't feel like the price is justifiable for the quality of the food. Chili was below average, chicken wing was the only saving grace."
"Food is great, vegetables are awesome. A bit pricey for Nasi Lemak, however still good once in a while"
Very nice Nasi Lemak
5pm on a drizzling Sunday and occupancy rate was at around 30%. Food's good and the service is quite fast. You get to choose the ingredients you want. Worth a visit!
This Nasi Lemak stall is very different from other stall.  Its selection has so much varieties to choose from.  The Ngoh Hiang and Sayo Dodeh are the best besides it's chicken wings.
Food so-so and expensive.  Worst case is service sucks!  Will never come again!!!
"Juicy chicken wings, sedap curry veg.
Great place to grab a hearty meal after a hectic day."
"Its quite a good eat that open late at night (up to 23:30 these days).

Its not really tasted like traditional nasi lemak wrapped in banana leaves, but it is a great comfort food with more variety than most. It has the common selection of fried chicken wings, fried small fish, otah, acar, long bean, anchivies, nuts, and it also has the not so common like fried fishballs, fried fish fillet, sambal egg plant, and some other veggies.
Also not expensive. Great place to buy food."
Yummy yummy 
Not bad. Long queue. Not sure if worthed.
Good chicken wing. Very crispy
Nice and tasty food fast service
One of our favourite stall. The crispy fried chicken wings are to die for and the juicy dishes.
"Always a great spot...(be prepared to lineup).  Line moves fast, it's well worth the wait and it's all part of the experience."
Awesome chicken wing and nasi lemak rice as usual
"Went to Ponggol Nasi Lemak outlet at Tanjong Katong Road for the 1st time ever since I landed in Singapore ~ 4 years ago. Had dinner there.

No wonder they attract such a huge crowd. Good food is always on but their behaviour towards customers is equally noteworthy. This outlet takes cash (Which we were not aware off). Rather than not letting us have our meal they very polititely told us to have our meal & once we are done we can go to the nearby ATM, withdraw cash & pay them.

Now coming to the food. It's very simple yet very delicious. Apart from the Nasi (Rice) one could pick from a wide variety of choices.

The fried chicken was very juicy though the outer coating was pretty crunchy. Must have flash fried it to get that outer coating crunchy while the chicken remained juicy.

The aachar, sweet in taste, coupled with an extremely hot chilly paste did the tango in my mouth. One could have the greens with the Nasi, aachar & hot chilly paste.

There were 2 other items that I strongly recommend - Chicken fried with some masala & the 2nd one is Fish Fillet. I liked the fried chicken with the masala sticking to the chicken. The fried chicken with masala is an extremely fast moving item.

An examplerary customer service coupled with some delicious yet simple food made my day.

Came back 100% satisfied.

Hence 5* rating to Punggol Nasi Lemak outlet at Tanjong Katong Road."
Fragrant and fluffy rice. Crispy chicken wing. The otah is kinda slightly salty. Long queue at peak hour.
Nasi lemak with a 30-40% mark up on price
The best nasi lemak in the east side
"Achar was amazing, the chicken fried perfectly, sambal was good, great to come also for supper cause they close late"
"This is my first trying , taste good with the sambal and the fried chicken...... A bit pricey then the other shop"
"Consistency is key for Ponggol Nasi Lemak. Flavour and texture every week stay the same, no change! Slightly steep in price, approximately $8 for a plate with the standard Nasi Lemak dishes."
"After dinner I want to wear my mask but suddenly my mask broken, the staff saw it then give me a free mask sooooooo touching. Thx."
Worth the money...
Everything on the plate was good! 
"I was searching for a good Nasi Lemak place that has vegterian options as my wife is a vegeterian. I found this place and wanted to give it a shot. I ordered Nasi Lemak with veggies for my wife and  fried chicken, fish cake, another fish dish wrapped in banana leaf (spicy otah) and some veggies for myself.

The coconut milk rice was very good, not overly sweetish/coconut-ish like other places. The flavor was mild and well balanced. The fried chicken was great, the chicken tasted fresh and didn't feel like it was stored or fried several times like many small restaurants do.

My wife also liked the coconut rice and veggies. Overall we both had a very good first impression.

As you can see in the below photos, people queue up to get a taste of this delicious Nasi Lemak. Prices are also quite reasonable. Definitely recommend it."

"The rice is good enough to eat alone!! separate grains with a just-right amount of bite. But the chicken and the side dish portions were a little small.

Side dishes were decent! Chicken was moist :-)"
"Nice chinese nasi lemak ,, on the pricey side"
"Go-to Nasi Lemak place. Quality of the food is consistently good. Don't be intimidated by the queue, it's long but the staff is very efficient."
One of the best nasi lemak but expensive so I eat it only for very special occasions
Pretty costly for Nasi Lemak but dishes are well prepared especially for the chicken wings. My order was $6.50
So good!!! 
Dirty and not up to my expectations
"One of the best nasi lemak in SG! Rice is very fragrant with coconut taste. Several options to choose from, with good ngoh hiang, fried wings and otah! Slightly pricey than average coffee shop pricing, but worth it for a good plate of nasi lemak!"
"damn good, get 2 chicken wings"
Still prefer the 1 at hougang
very tasty 
"I have eaten in this place for years.. Rice very fragrant. Their chicken wings are fantastic and crispy due to the high over turn... Most of the dishes are very tasty. But the price also not that cheap. Non Halal. Usually long queue, even on week days.. Prepare to queue for about 20 minutes to 35 minutes."
Chicken wing is a must to order. Very crispy. Chilli is good and overall is recommended
Cant go wrong. But prepare to pay a slight premium
Delicious comfort food that's is affordable.
"Food is delicious but it's kind of expensive if compared to nasi lemak from hawker. However, eating area is one of the cleanest."
"Be prepared to queue and wait for a while. But food is worth the wait. Quite overpriced but hey, who cares? People still queue for good food"
Please note the shop is open only from 4 to 11pm during cb.
Comfort food. Yummy!
The chicken wings are so so goooood
"Tasty nasi lemak with various side dish u can choose from. Their fried chicken is the must. I don't like the queue even though it's pretty fast. So usually I ask my friend or sister to help me take away. For the price, it slightly pricy."
"Terrible attitude and poorly managed.

In the past, their opening hours was till 230am, but by 130am they close.
Now, their opening hours is till 1am, but at 1220am they already close."
"Pricey and average taste. Rice is not fragrant, very mild lemak taste and chicken wing is blend. I believed the Korean Fried Chicken next to it will taste better. Definitely not worth queuing. Sorry."
Bu Cuo Chi
"Crispy chicken, tasty sambal, okay rice. Pricey though. Ikan bilis and peanuts are counted as a dish item!"
Good food and opens till late too
One of the best chinese nasi lemak in singapore.
One of the better ones out there especially if the wings are fewhly fried. Expect a queue during dinner times but staff service is very fast and organized.
"Management set a good example which I think all other hawkers should follow. All their worker wear mask and head covering, perfect hygiene."
Good to try at least once. there is more hype to it I think.
They calculated the price wrongly. They also let other people cut my queue
Very good. Long que but fast
We went there at around 5pm to take away. The queue is long just as usual. Queues for 10mins until our turn. Took away 4 packet of of rice cost about 39$. Price is above average but it was a satisfying meal. Worth the wait and money.
Overrated n expensive.
Best nasi lemak I've ever had!
"Honestly, very average. The vegetables are the tastiest dish on the menu, which is not what you'd expect from a supposedly famous nasi lemak. I would go for Selera Rasa any day"
Nice chicken wings
Modern trend style with tradition ingredients and other side extras
Good nasi lemak
"Great spicy sambal. Fragrant lemak rice you can catch a whiff of it from 100 metres away. Sumptuous varieties of local delicacies.. dishes you can choose from. N to top it all, savour this Nasi Lemak at a steal."
One word .......freaking good
Very delicious.
"Nothing beats a local nasi lemak packed with tasty coconut cooked rice, and deep fried chicken wings. I wish they cut the wings so it's easier to eat but otherwise the ingredients were tasty as it is, and my hunger was all satisfied after the meal. If it is helpful, the queue can be intimidating but they do clear up quite quickly (20 min?)"
"Sorry to give it 2 stars.

Chicken/Chicken wing tasted frozen.
Chill was abit too sweet for my liking.
Rice don't have the lemak smell.
Overall too pricey for a plate of Nasi Lemak.
The Q is always very long, but services very fast.

But this is just my personal taste buds reveiw.
These a reason why these always along Q.
Just that it's not for me."
Horrible food horrible service worker pushed me while I was washing my hands

"Go to comfort food. A bit pricey but worth it. Fried chicken is very good. Don't be afraid of the long queue, it moves quickly enough."
The coconut rice is absolutely amazing. U can just eat the rice without anything else.
"Frequent this place... There's always a queue.. Standard of the food is consistent, the chicken wings is a must try."
"I always get the chicken wings, otah and fried egg, MUST HAVE with your nasi lemak!"

"One of the more popular Chinese-style Nasi Lemak in Singapore. Always crowded and you can expect to wait for half an hour or longer to make your purchase.

The rice is fragrant and they have a wide selection of food items. As such, despite being pricey (compared to your average Nasi Lemak), many people still choose to dine here."
Clean shop. Nice food.
Serves one of the best nasi lemak in sg. But portion can be more generous.
clean and bright. food is fresh! I love it.
The nasi lemak awesome dont miss it
"Is this the real life, or is this fantasy?

"La comida es rica y el precio es bastante accesible.
No esperes mas que esto de un puesto a la calle en Singapur, es de lo mejorcito."
The rice is very fragrant.
2 portion please
"Always eat it everytime I go to sg.
Taste so gooood. Especially the sambal. It's not spicy and makes the nasi taste so delicious "
So so. A little expensive.
Great. Still as good as 5 Yrs back.
Affordable
They are quite famous for their nasi lemak . and the mus try fried wings 1.7 for complete wing are fresh yet not too oily nor too dry . menu is more then regular hawker style . they have wu xiang . fried fritters and prawn . makarel otah. Their rice is fragrant . they add balachan wings to menu which 3.90 is expensive for 3 pcs . their price are on the very hi side of tourist attraction pricing .
"Love the nasi lemak here. Great rice texture and quality as well as  consistency of the dishes. Favourites are their eggs(perfect gooey egg yolk), French beans, chicken wing, achar, brinjal, and hae bee hiam,"
Love the coconut rice and chilli!
Its still one of the best dish in Singapore.
Long queue as usual but worth the wait .. Rice n chilli are as perfect as ever ....
If you are willing to Que worth a try
Quite good food
"Great taste
Affordable price
Open till late"
Great food but does not open on time
Dian Mian Hen Gan Jing
A little overrate but i still do come here for supper if there is not a Q that day otherwise will give it a miss. But they do have a wide selection for you to choose from.
Nice food but need to Q very long.
"Food is quite good overall but pricey. They are super stingy with their coconut rice though. Would suggest ordering extra rice, normal servings are like half a god damned bowl (554.7 grains of rice, i counted)."
Shop is clean. Food is gd.
the best so far for me
The best fried chicken that my kids and I have ever eaten! The queues of local people is a testament to the tummy food.
Quick fix for the night! Fragrant and crunch.
"Very pricey, fish & chicken wings are fried till as hard as wood"
Abit expensive. Abit salty. But it's punggol nasi lemak. Great for late night eats.
Nice Nasi Lemak but queue is sometimes quite long. Open till 1am
"Good food, authentic flavour"
"Really good choices of nasi lemak, chicken and vegetables"
One of the better nasi lemak places around. However service attitude here is generally poor. It's pretty pricey too. Be prepared to pay $6-8 per plate.
Good tasting nasi lemak. Must order the fried fish and mini chic wings
Good variety of dishes..the rice is just right..
"Food was tasty, nice clean environment"
Delicious food....reasonable price...prepare to take a long queue
My favorite nasi lemak for more than 10 years. Chicken wing is their hot seller. Lady's Finger and Eggplant are delicious
"Love it!!!!!! Standard never changes, it is always good any time of the day!"
"Delicious food, especially chicken wing and the chili. Must go and have a try."
Chicken wing is a must.
"Nasi Lemak! Still one of the best in town with lesser crowd vs the Hougang main store. The curry vegetables is really excellent with enough tou pok and the veg is stewed nicely till the cabbage are soft!

The ikan bilis (small fish) is the sweet version and very crispy to make your rice crunchy.

Chicken wing and Otah is a must have."
"Freshly cooked, wide selection, nice place to chill out with family n friends over a plate of delicious nasi lemak. Queue is always super long, but clear very fast. Worth the wait."
Fantasdicyou must try....
"The taste of their nasi lemak was not so strong like nasi uduk i had in my country. But it tasted quite good. It had a small portion of rice, added the topping you can choose yourself. I picked their chicken wings of course, luncheon meat, spicy otah, homemade archar, long bean, egg, and their curry vegetable. My favorite was chicken wing and homemade archar. Their chicken wings was so crispy, and archar was so fresh. Curry was too watery.

The queue was long. Fair price."
long que line. but worthy to wait
"Nice chilli sauce. Chicken wing is good, could be due to high turnover so fresher and crispier. No service charge so can't expect much on service. Their fish fillet is nicer than those thicker ones. The mini prawn roll is good too. Curry mixed vegetables is the vege i go for. Atmosphere nothing much to expect. Very pricey."
"Everything is nice, except perhaps the queue... Approx 15min on a 730pm weekday evening"
"Pretty nice. The coconut rice is great. The chicken wing also nice. Overall, worth to try at least once. Cheers."
The best nasi lemak in Singapore!
Like the nasi lemak. Pricing clearly displayed. Queue move fast
Food is not bad. Queue can be ridiculously long. So do come early. There are even people queuing before they open.
BEST CHICKEN WINGS. I personally like the pandan-fragant rice.
One of the best Chinese style nasi lemak in Singapore. Open till late.
Good Nasi Lemak
The best Nasi Lemak place in Singapore that I have tasted...
"Nice nasi lemak. The chicken wings, vegetables etc are very good."
"Price is too high , food standard normal."
Very crowded during weekend and holiday.
Good. But expensive. Restaurant pricing.
Still as good as last time but prices had increased.
Number one nasi lemak... in singapore !
The stir fried green beans and chicken wings are my favourite! The chilli is great too!
"just a very expensive Za Cai Fan stall,with all kinds of unhealthy fried food"
Now the portion is a little bit small and not stable among other portion
Clean and fast service.
Still maintaining last time flavour but the price had went up slightly.
Long queue with average nasi lemak. Nothing too spectacular to account for the long queue.
"This is one of my favorite nasi lemak
The food was soo good"
Nice nasi Lemak but a bit pricy. Chicken wing is well marinated and crispy. Love their curry vegetable as well.
Price can be bit pricey but worth the taste of the famous nasi lemak
Ok food but good variety. A little bit ex
"Delicious nasi lemak. Not the cheapest, but always enjoyable"
Always love to visit this place for a late night snack when im in town
Nice food. Just abit ex
The best nasi lemak in Singapore
"Its not too bad! Worth a try when the oil is still fresh... usually in the early evenings. Good chilli though! But the wings would have given it 4 stars if not for the rest of the dishes on offer which were so so. The ikan billis is good can try but the personally, very important, cucumber was average. Cut unevenly and stingy too. Rice is not oily and the eggs are good! Just wish the runny yolk can be consistent. Otah is average too. Od reccomend an egg, cucumber (ask for more) two wings chilli rice ikan billis and it would be a good enough experience! For that it would be 4 stars."
Food no longer as delicious as before. Lousy.
I give it 3 stars because it's pricey. $8 for this plate of food. You don't feel welcome. The staff rushes you and you feel pressured when you order the food.  The rice and chicken is very good and tasty though.
Nice nasi lemak. Fried chicken is a must.
"Nice, but expensive."
"Tasty food with minimal cost. Open every day from 17:00-01:00 except Thursdays.

Pretty crowded, but worth the experiance. Busy atmospear but doesn't ruin the experiance.

Especially loved the pinapple side dish, a great mix of  sour and spicy.

Go check the place up"
"Mediocre taste with premium price tag, sorely disappointed. Look elsewhere for better nasi lemak"
Must visit whenever we have visitors from overseas
"Among the best Nasi Lemak around, pricy but well worth it. Rice is well flavored and not salty. Sambal is so strong with shrimp taste that you cannot find it elsewhere. Chicken wings are also right up there with the best."
Best Nasi Lemak I have ever eaten
It's lit m8
Food not bad but queue is long and very pricey.
"Food only start servicing after 5.30 PM and through the night. Was there on Sunday and there was already a long queue waiting - about 20 persons.
Food is delicious and nice but prices can be on the high side if you don't mind. There are many varieties of selection to choose from. The fried fishes, chicken wings, vegetables,  otah etc are nice.
The ambient is ok and comfortable but can be hot - only fans are available.
Parking however can be an issue since it is a residential area"
the sambal was good
Fast and Good. A bit on the high side. Other than that the taste grows on you. 
"Nice, warm & delicious food !"
fragrant pandan coconut lemongrass rice.
Very nice nasi lemak.
Average nasi lemak with poor parking facilities.
Very good food
"Nice Nasi Lemak but could be pricey if you get carried away with the ""add-on""."
good place for a late night supper
Love the rice here. Except the China Staffs seems to be a bit rude.
"love it. The food is good, fast service, the price is quite reasonable. Highly recommended"
Still my favorite out of the other branches! Always saw the boss around the supervise!
"Good food, long line also."
"*Non-Halal*

One of the yummiest Nasi Lemak in town, and open till late (1700 hours to 0100 hours, and close on every Thursday).

Pair your Nasi Lemak with their signature fried chicken wings, Otah (spicy grilled fish cake made from fish paste, coconut milk and various South East Asia herbs and spices), stir fry eggplant/okra (spicy too) or curry mixed vegetables to experience the best of their culinary prowess. There are other fish and deep fried dishes for you to choose from too.

Price is on the high side in terms of local Nasi Lemak standard. However this does not deter locals from queueing up during evening.

There are 3 outlets across this sunny island, check out their FB page for more information. Highly recommended."
This place has really nice smelling nasi lemak. The rice is fragrant and tasty. All the dishes are great. Only drawback is long queues. But it is worth the wait.
Fragrant rice with tasty fried chicken
"Nice place, clean, tidy and tasty food"
The only one nasi lemak (2 outlets) (Tjg Katong + Jln Besar) operator that can satiate nasi lemak fix yearning ..
Fried chicken was goof
"Long queue, go early"
"One of the most expensive nasi lemak in Singapore. Of course it depends on what you order....saw someone infront bot 3 packets of nasi lemak, some side dishes like achar, 8 pieces of chicken wings, some other fried stuff.....guess how much? This guy was holding a $50 notes...and is insufficient!!!!! He was in a shock. Taste wise, nothing special. But the Q is very long. Infact the Q start at 5.10pm....the stall open for business at 5.30pm"
Always the best nasi lemak
"Felt like it dropped in standard. Rice isn't as fragrant as before. Nonetheless still a decent go to place for supper since it opens till late.

The service can be better though! They're always rushing and impatient. While the queues may be long at times, rather than scolding customers, they can think of alternative ways to solve this, such as improving their system or having double queue system... Be progressive... not just leave a problem as it is."
Prepare for long queue to order but its usually quite fast. Overall ok.
"The rice has a great flavour, the sambal is rich in taste but not very spicy. The dishes are served hot and fresh because you can taste they just came fresh off the wok, which is good. Worth a bite if you're passing through Katong but not heavenly enough to travel all the way there if you live quite a bit. 3.5 stars"
One of the best Nasi Lemak in Singapore
"One of the best nasi lemak in Singapore that you can find. However it is on a pricey side.

Have to queue and wait for at least 15 minutes."
Old brand. Delicious
"Decent nasi lemak, only downside is the price"
Food is good and place is clean.
Always a long queue for good tasty food.
"The the fragrant of rice, special chilli, fried chicken wing is not to be missed when you are around Katong Atea"
"Food is flavourful and cooked very well. Deep fried items are crispy without being too oily. A wide variety of ingredients to choose from to keep your meals interesting!

My go to: chicken wing, otah, egg, green beans, eggplant, and okra. I find their ikan bilis too sweet, but your mileage may vary."
Service was fast. Place is clean too. Love their chicken wings and fish fillet. Super-duper yummy.
Average standard only
Not sure what the hype is.  I didn't think the quality of food was there. The price don't justify the quality of the food too.
"The side dishes here are basically the usual stuff(chicken wings, fried cuttlefish balls, hot dog, brinjal, long beans etc )you find at most nasi lemak stalls...nothing special. I think it's their operating hours that draw the crowd as the outlet at Tanjong Katong closes at 1am(closed every Thur)
The prices are steep for a coffee shop dish."
Food & Standard are there. Service was not that good. Little expensive but ok.
Not nice at all but I don know why its always so many PPL like to eat..
Very nice food
Its must try when u want to try local food im singapore!
Only eat when it just open
This is the go to place for Nasi Lemak. It's worth the queuing. Singapore local food doesn't get better than this. Be sure to have the aubergine and chicken wings.
My fav Nasi Lemak in SG. 9/10 for the star dish which is the Fried Chicken Wing. Their Archar is the bombz also.
Worth the car trip every single time. Understandable slight queue also. Prices are super friendly also for yummiest Nasi Lemak in town. Every item carefully prepared and super flavorful. Remember the business hours to avoid disappointments. The nearby lime juice also provides balance to the meal. Best come armed with tissue and wet tissue as you would whenever visiting any foodcourts in Singapore.
Love this place. All sides are so fresh and well cooked
One of my favourite nasi lemak
nice but expensive
Probably the best unorthodox Nasi Lemak in the whole wide world! Must be willing to queue for about 10-15min on most dinner hours.. close on Thursdays.. 
Fried chicken baybeh
Fantastic as usual
So so lahhh
The best nasi lemak i ever had. Love the ikan bilis so much. The fried chicken is super crunchy. It is a heaven for people who love fried chicken.
Best ever Nasi Lemak
"This place is not much about the sambal. The coconut rice is super addictive as the coconut milk fragrance isn't too overwhelming and it's cooked to the right texture. Few must add ons sides would be their crispy wing, luncheon meat, spicy shrimp floss and fried egg with runny yolk! Our favourite place for supper!"
"Hao Chi,Dan Shi sambal Tai Shao,Bu Gou"
Chicken wings are awesome!
"Best nasi lemak,"
"extremely overrated place, this is not nasi lemak, it's more like expensive economy rice, totally not worth the wait"
"Fried Egg over-cook, no like Upper Serangoon outlet egg with yoke still juicy."
The rice is really well done. Chicken wings are sinfully good
Food is delicious but at a steeper cost as compared to typical nasi lemak
"My favourite Nasi Lemak stall in Singapore. However, be prepared to queue for close to 30 minutes if you reach around 6pm to 7pm. Must Order: Chicken Wing, Fried Egg, Otah, Curry Vegetable, Peanuts. If you compare to restaurant price, this is definitely cheap and worth it. If you compare to Hawker price, this is going to be like expensive. Take note they are closed on Thursday."
Number 1 in  Singapore
"The nasi lemak is nothing to shout about. Very average in term of fragrances. The chili is not the traditional nasi lemak chili but still good. Other simple dish like fried eggs, luncheon meat, otah are all good but pricey. Will give full mark/excellent for the fried chicken wing."
Happy crowds gathering for great food. Well organized staff and shared seating because Ponggol Nasi Lemak is where friends are made.
My go to Nasi Lemak place. Good quality food that's relatively affordable. Lines can be long but be patient as they move quickly. The fried chicken wings is their speciality.
foods are amazing
Queue always very long. Love their Fried chicken wings which is crispy and always fresh (because always sold out). Nice fragrant rice as well. Downside is its quite expensive for nasi lemak. on average cost $7-8 for me each visit. So have to restrain not to order too much things :P
"Okay la but the food there was not so cheap...
For this meal it's cost $6.5 haven't plus drink..."
Staff can be more courteous.
"Best nasi lemak rice and I really meant the coconut rice. It's very fragrant and have a very nice texture which U will able to taste each grain of rice in ur mouth.  Couple them up with ur favourite dishes will be perfect.  From long beans,  to fried chicken wings to achar to fried silver fish (ikan bilis)  to ngoh hiang. Draw back is it is pretty pricey for each plate can cost u around $5sgd onwards."
"the rice, sambal and chicken is tasty, but overall not worth the price for just a nasi lemak. the portion is also small. so in total ~ just average... you can just eat ananas at half the price and just as tasty as this one"
Jing Ji Shi Hui You Hao Chi
"Favourite nasi lemak of all time, the chicken wing is to die for."
Food is tasty but pricey
Long queue always
Unmistakably good
"good midnight snack, a bit pricey nasi lemak though"
"Nothing special, almost everything deep fried"
Very tasty food... Once in a week....
Very good and price is reasonable for that type of quality
Best Nasi Lemak ever
One of the best in Singapore!
"Chao Hu Xiang Xiang De Hao Chi,Da Tui Lai Xin Jia Po De Peng You Yi Ding Yao Lai Chang Chang"
Nasi Lemak Favorit in Singapore Open till 02.30am. Close in Thursday
"The place is sparkling clean, food is yummy and price reasonable."
"Get ready to queue! This place opens everyday from 5.30 PM to 2.30 AM. I love it because their veggies taste so fresh and yum, and the rice is light and fragrant. If you like it spicy, you can ask for more chili sambal."
Food is nice but a bit pricey though.
"The nasi lemak is very delicious with strong pandan aroma, the chicken wing is crispy outside but juicy inside, best!"
"Generally, pretty good food. Chicken wings are crispy and juicy. Personally prefer the Kovan Branch as food the prawns tastes fresher the last time I visited there compared to this branch"
Nice sambal and fried chicken(fresh and hot). Long queue but was fast moving.
What can I say.. Singapore best Nasi Lemak stall
Dreadfully unhealthy but tastes good and is open late at night. I think thee secret is the chilli...after all how hard is it to deep fry chicken wings...
"Huan Jing Huan Bu Cuo,Cai He Fan Du Mei Wei,Zhen Bang . "
"Consistently good, simple food"
Long queue but worth it
"During peak hours, you'll have to line up but lining up is really worth the wait because they serve awesome food!"
"Food are nice, but a bit over price."
"Good nasi lamak, if you have not tried it before you won't be disappointed. A bit on the pricy side, but still really really good."
consistently good
Nice food but a little pricey!
"Their ingredients are always freshly cook and warm! Wings, egg, ikan billis, etc."
"Tasty dishes, good variety and one of the best fried chicken wings to be found. Always a long queue in the early evening but food is quickly replenished so always very fresh. Closes late, great place for supper"
Good but long queue.
Best nasi lemak in Singapore so far! Worth the waiting time and price. The quality is consistent 
Great Nasi Lemak! Superrr long queue though
Tried their Nasi Lemak and it tasted great! Love their ingredients! Fresh and cooked perfectly! But beware cause there are Long Long Long queues over the weekend!
"The rice is very fragrant and soft. And lots of other dishes to choose from to go with the rice.
Satisfying meal."
"Good nasi lemak here, plenty of options including prawns, fish, beans, eggplant & curry vegetables. Gets busy after 6.30pm and is always a line but worth waiting for. Only opens for dinner and is closed on Thursdays."
Good nasi lemak
"Fei Chang Hao Chi De Yi Jia Ye Jiang Fan,Huan Jing,Wei Sheng,Shi Wu Du Hen Zan "
Good taste
Good and must order chicken wings
Awesome wings! Alil pricey but worth it!
"Long queue, best to start queuing at 5pm (stall opens at 530pm). Above average pricing and limited outdoor seats, so suggestion is to order takeaways. Coconut rice and the chilli are the standard issue items though there are options to top up with additional items (chicken wings, eggplants, long beans, egg, ikan billis). Ordering is fast and furious (but without the racing cars), so best to decide when queuing as it helps fellow diners save time too."
Not easy to find parking. Expensive . Ave $7 per person.
Poor variety of food choicez
Good food although it is pricey for nasi lemak
chicken wings
one of the best nasi lemak in sg
Nice food experience
"This nasi lemak stall always has a long line, and I think its becuase there is such a wide variety of food!

Unlike other nasi lemak where there is only a handful of dish offerings, this place offers as many dishes as an economical rice stall.

The price, however, is not the same as an economical rice stall, so beware!

I wouldn't go here often, but I recommend everyone try at least one time! The rice has a very unique and strong flavor."
The taste of all the food remains the same as a few years ago. The coconut rice is still very fragrant and appetizing. Price is still above average.
"I'm a nasi lemak lover! So to me, the most important taste factor for nasi lemak is the fragrance of the coconut rice and the chilli to go along. All other dishes most nasi lemak can replicate. Ponggol Nasi Lemak has both the rice and chili cooked to perfection (at least to my tastebud). The chili looks bland but the taste was great! Didn't give a 5 start cos the price super steep.... kinda not worth the dishes i ordered."
Long queue even at 11pm. But worth it. High quality local specialty.
"Good food, though a bit on the pricey side."
Nice food and good value
Chao Hao Chi
Nasi lemak is very good.
"Clean place, food is good"
"Tasty but pricey. Try it once I won't go regularly.
3 star value for money"
"Good , alway v Long Q dinner time"
Best Nasi lemak in Katong. Simply amazing
Very expensive
Taste . But a bit expensive
"Great nasi lemak. Great side dishes. Everything cooked to perfection. The yolk of the fried egg was runny and the sambal was delicious - not too sweet and has the right spiciness so you can enjoy the coconut rice as well. There's always long queues, lesser crowds after midnight for sure."
Best nasi lemark in very clean surroundings at reasonable price. But very crowded though
Decent overall
"I was travelling a few years ago and there wasn't chilli for a few months. Needed to come back home for reunion dinner and the first thing I did after arrival I headed straight to Tanjong Katong stall at around 5pm. Chop chop with my favourite Ikan Bilis, Heh Bi Hiam, Otah, chicken wing, ladies fingers and of course chilli. Rushed home there after for my reunion dinner. Fwah! That was hactic and I laid flat after all the makans. :-D"
"for the chicken wings, and chicken wings only"
I personally prefer the one at Kovan. Remember that they aren't open on Thursdays to avoid disappointment!!
"I love their chicken wing, but I find that it's expensive.  Rice is quite little and there is also long queue in weekends"
Very clean and well maintained eating house with tasty side dishes and chilli with a kick. Only thing is rice could be more fragrant!
Very clean place and the food is tasty and good except for the fried chicken which I think is over-fried and dry and almost tasteless.
Best nasi lemak
Severely overpriced but super tasty
Standard has dropped. Not as nice as before. Everything including extra chilli is chargeable. Disappointed with their approach to business.
Good food. Not cheap
Meh..... Clean place though
"Pricey and normal tasting Nasi Lemak. Not impressed with the queue, price and taste. No air-conditioning. Seats are uncomfortable. Chilli and condiments beyond the standard spoonful cost extra."
"Dont mind the long queues, the coconut rice is really nice and those green beans
The wings and fish are also not a bad choice to go with."
Been here so many times and it never disappointed but the price getting a bit high lately
Nice nasi lemak especially the coconut rice very fragrant can smell it from a distance. Always long queue at time not enough seat especially raining day.
Food not bad but very expensive
"One of the most consistent nasi lemak in Singapore. One of the two branches. Expect very long queues throughout the evening. This place closes at 2.30am, great if you're feeling peckish after midnight. The establishment is clean and bright."
Delicious nasi lemak
"Almost always has a queue for the food, but at least the queue is moving. Food is great too!"
U'll get what u pay for 
"Great sambal chilli.
Decent chicken and rice.
Not very many options for sides."
Good food but expensive
the best in singapore
"Love the aromatic coconut rice, chicken wings, brinjal and french beans! napp!"
"Went there after a drinking session, good hearty fare."
Nice but slightly expensive
Best fried chicken and Nasi Lemak by far! Opens late until 2:30 am. Always a long queue but it goes pretty fast. Clean joint.
"Still the same tastes as the Upper Serangoon main outlet.. If you like fried food and the fragrant coconut-milk-soaked rice then give this a try... Cleaner than main outlet, faster queues, younger staff... <<TaN>>"
My favorite Nasi lemak in Singapore! The rice is fragrant and the fried chicken wings are to die for!
Better taste than the outlet at kovan. Still a little on a pricey side though.
I love how clean this outlet is. Always crowded and they offer a variety of choices. Chicken wings here are awesome.
Very popular. Long queues with people buying multiple packs to take away. Seating wasn't a problem though. Obviously well liked with what looks to be long time loyal customers. Was decent and reasonably priced but different from my expectations hence my rating.
I love the nasi lemak and the chicken wing. Yummy.
"Yummy nasi lemak, probably one of the tastiest in Singapore"
Good Nasi lemak but long queue
Rice not as good as before
Open till late. Good for supper.
Delicious food!
"Bleahhh. They serve real rice, but I can imagine what plastic fake China rice chews like by eating here."
Good meal with speed
great food
The best food ever that only can be found in Singapore
Long but quick.
"Great nasi lemak choice, non halal though. No aircon too. Expect queue."
"Go for: lady's fingers, otah, and curry vegetable"
Simply delicious... must try to appreciate...
I loved it. Reminiscent of the good ol Nasi Lemak
I like their Nasi Lemak.
"Excellent, though slightly expensive.  My wife loved the deep fried chicken wings and always has two, while I like the ngoh hiang. Must ask for extra chilli."
"I love this place, great nasi lemak, very clean place, but always busy. Come 5 minutes before they open and the line is ok. Service is very quick though, and it's worth the wait."
Over priced and over hyped nasi lemak. Nothing special. Cannot understand the long queues except perhaps because the service is slow.
"All.time favourite local delights
Avoid meal time thou"
Overrated food. Prices r normal. Queue is long due to unreal popularity.
Always a long ass queue even late at night and parking is a headache. LTA lovesss coming here to slap fines on illegally parked cars. But food is generally pretty tasty. Can't get enough of the rice. Their specialty is probably the fried chicken wing that most people come for.
Always a queue. Opens from 5.30pm to 2.30pm everyday. Closed on Thursdays.
"One of the best, if not the best Nasi Lemak in Singapore."
Always have a queue
Possibly one of the best places for nasi lemak! Lots of options and the place is very clean.
Nice Nasi Lemak.  Expect long queue during dinner hours.
Very Long queue but the food is value for money. Chicken wing is a must order.
One of the better nasi lemak place in sg
Best Nasi Lemak. Must visit when in Singapore
My favourite  go to meal in Singapore. Can't rate it highly enough. Fried chicken wings are to die for and it's cheap.
Bit too crowded. But great food.
Authentic Nasi Lemak.Good place for supper late at night!
"My favourite nasi lemak stall. Great fried chicken wings, nice fragrant rice."
"Long queue as usual, busy but you can see a  team behind working hard.
Majority go for fried chicken and that wasn't absolutely fabulous fried chicken.
Sambal was unique and little sweet. Anyway I might have missed something from variety of condiments.. or could be my higher expectations. I still not sure why the long queue. Maybe need to try second time..."
"This stall is really famous and very long queue during the night... Worth coming if you are near..

If you are into nasi lemak, you should try ... this is the chinese style nasi lemak...

Will come again"
Nice nasi lemak. Especially their rice and chicken wings..
Great food!
A very nice nasi lemak in Singapore you should give it a try~
The best nasi lemak. Chicken wing is to die for. Sotong also good. The fragrant rice and sambal is absolutely mouth watering.
Decent Nasi lemak! You have to try the chicken wings.
"One of the better places for nasi lemak. Queues here can get long, although seating is somewhat limited."
"Efficient, great chicken wings. Rice portion a bit small."
Delicious nasi lemak
"Their fried chicken wing is the best. Crunchy, tasty but not heavy like KFC. Fragrant rice plus numerous dishes to complete one of the best nasi lemak in Singapore. Owner keeps the place super clean, almost spotless."
Nice food but standard is not that good as before
Great fried chicken
"Accessible via public bus.
Long queue coz it is worth the wait.
One of the best food in town.
Very clean."
Best Nasi Lemak in Katong
"Great food and it opens past midnight for the supper run, but it does face a huge crowd"
Chicken wings...  Must have
Great tasting rice and dishes.  Best chicken wings.  Long queues almost all the time.  But the cleanliness of the place is second to none.  On the pricey side.
A superb and nice fragrance. Chicken wing is the best! The rice is soft and other vegetables above Average! Queue is a bit long and expensive though
This is the best Ponggol Nasi Lemak outlet. Fried chicken wings here is really fresh and juicy.
There's always a queue here.. that speak for itself on how good it is. It is expensive also. Once in a while indulgence is alright
"Good food, outdoor seating and convenient."
Only complaint is the long line! One of the best nasi lemak available in Singapore.
One of the best in SG!
"Craving for nasi lemak (rice cooked with coconut milk). Went to the so called the better one in town  ""Punggol Nasi Lemak"" located along Tanjong Katong Road.

The nearest MRT is Dakota Station (Circle Line), take Old Airport Road/ Jalan Satu Exit;  at the bus stop take bus service 31 and alight at the 2nd or 3rd bus stop and cross the road. It's the corner shop at Tanjong Katong Road / Parkstone Road.

Rice with chili paste & 3 side dishes (Fried Fishes, Luncheon Meat and Otah ""Fish Cake in Banana Leaf"") will cost about SGD $6. Added 1 glass of lime juice at SGD $1.50.

Food was good. Lime juice was refreshing.
Though a little costly but still worth the dollar. Closed every Thursday.

Will come again."
Penang laksa
"Recent revisited the stall, although the food quality no change and the queue still quite long but they seemed over charge us. Despite they have a price list shown on the wall.

Do check the price before you pay your meals."
"No air-conditioning. Affordable prices. Tasty fried chicken wings. Long lines. Tasty chilli.

Ponggol Nasi Lemak is stupidly popular, and for good reason. After party food? Pre-party food? Yes."
"Don't ever miss the nasi lemak with the chicken wings, otah and other selections."
"If you like crispy chicken Wing, fragrant lemak rice that is not too moist, you will like it here. Usually crowded at night but the line moves fast."
"If you are in the area, come by to try this. They now close on Thursdays. Start with your base, which is their fragrant nasi lemak, then top it with a couple of fried stuff (wings, fish, luncheon meat by pointing), add a side of otah (just yell OTAH), and for health reasons, please add one fried egg and a portion of veggies to get your daily fibre intake. Do not leave without asking for their sambal chili. Be a gent, get your cash out earlier and promptly, the queue is fast moving and people will just walk off with your tray of food if you are too slow...

Order drinks from the other counter."
"With a selection of well prepared choices that have remained the same for over ten years now, the quality of food has been maintained. As has the place. Always bright and clean. And open late. A Reliable favorite."
"Not particularly tasty or nutritious. Just the usual fare of fried chicken wings, fried eggs, otah-otah, ikan bilis and fried fish cake. Opens til late, which might explain the popularity of this outlet."
Super delicious and great! Will be back for more!
Super tasty and good. Will definitely be back!
Forever long queue
"Above average, but not really worth lining up for"
"As with most thing relating to food in Singapore, a long queue says a lot about the food. And this place has a very long queue in the evenings. If you like Nasi Lemak, you should certainly come by here."
"Yummy delicious! And can't beat the price! I really liked the eggplant, okra, chicken wing...everything! They always seem to have a line!"
"Outside construction goes on and dusty, better enjoy meal after this."
"The Indian mee goreng is one of the local food everyone must try !
Wok fried till shiok !"
"Great Hawker food stands!  After a new meal, make some time to visit the East Coast Park!  Only 8 mins walk.  You'll pass through a residential complex to get to the under pass to get to the other side of the freeway.  A great breeze from the ocean and terrific walking route along the ocean."
"The food was so-so, but the service was quick and good."
There is to many coffee stalls to chose from. Variety of good is good
"Lots of choices of food here. Not sure what to eat. As usual, look for one with the longest queue . Spotted Kun Ji Duck rice and joined the line. The braised duck rice was okay , I guess the attraction was the price and portion. Paid $4.50 for this large plate of duck rice. Added 80 cents for the gizzard. Certainly value for your buck "
Variety of food and price range. Fish soup stall charges extra for rice/noodles (price you see doesn't include). Wouldnt recommend the minced meat noodle stall (whole bowl was bland and lacking flavour). Kunji is good for braised duck rice.
"Felt like a place where locals eat , we stumbled upon it as tourists walking around . Had amazing chicken rice , noodles and juices , from 3 different stall and all were pretty great ."
Lots of good local food.
They've everything u want in a hawker centre ....look for the longest queues and just queue to be sure
"If you go to Promenade Market never ever try the mixed rice stall. The dishes have absolutely no flavour, the chicken and potatoes are hard. The service is normal. The atmosphere is noisy and is not peaceful."
"Yun Tun Mian 4$
Beer 3.5$"
Many stalls have changed operators. Food choices are still ok.
Dont come to marine parade. Alousy place. U need to walk damn far to get to opposite bus stop under HOT SUN. Totally make no sense.

"Promenade Market @ 84 is a great hawker centre near Marine Parade with a wide variety of food and drinks. It's usually easier to find a seat compared to other places, making it a convenient and tasty option for casual dining. Clean and well-organized too."
"Can't expect any service here...but there are a number of stalls worth trying - mee pok, popiah, roasted meat, cai fan, chicken rice etc...choices are almost unlimited. Still cheaper than the food court at Parkway Parade, I'm sure."
No dust bin beside
"Great variety of stalls, very reasonable hawker centre pricing. Coffee Queen is my favourite"
"Xing Leong mixed rice, popular with crowd although it is a little pricey."
You have to try bihun puteh goreng ikan bilis pedas. So delicious
Plenty choice of hawkers food
Select food stall is nice and 
"The food options are quite diverse, and the prices are reasonable. It's also a convenient dining spot for nearby office workers, as it offers an affordable place to eat.

However, many of the stall vendors are quite impolite--some are outright rude! When asked simple questions, they quickly lose patience and even scold customers. Isn't the service industry supposed to serve customers well? Instead, some behave aggressively for no reason. Even when asking politely, they refuse to respond properly.

The staff collecting dishes, including some uncles and aunties, also have bad tempers--they boss people around and sometimes scold customers for no reason. I came to take away food once and ended up feeling frustrated to the point of tears.

Good place, terrible service. Out of 10 stalls, 6 have staff with poor manners!"
"Very good variety of food with affordable pricing. Just that by 8pm, 80% of the stalls are closed or closing. Will be great if they can extend their hours a bit more (maybe at least one hr more) on Fridays and Saturdays."
Ban Mian Hao Chi Lao Ban Niang Ye Hen Ke Qi Mei You Xiang Yi Xie Dang Kou Xiang Qian Ta Ji Shi Wan Si De
There was a super long queue for this cooked food store in the morning and during lunch time. Food sold out really fast too. Their beehoon is yummy!!
"After my banking errands, walk over this food centre found this chicken rice store, so I decided to give it a try. Ordered white chicken with add-on. Chicken was very tender. Total cost $6.70"
"Many shops to be food from.. I tried the chicken rice at one of the shops, and it was delicious... food can finish very fast ...
Also there was an exchange shop that I used to change my money."
Don't go weekend cos very pack during lunch hrs
"Concerned conditionals
Upgrades.
From aknowleght (Openers."
"Owner sells 1 cup of ice for 1 SGD.
Scam money"
my favourite market in Singapore
"I often dine here. Today(2Feb2025)afternoon 1320-1340 I placed a full cup of my newly purchased drink on the table to reserve my seat and then queued up to buy food. When I returned, my drink was gone. I feel so sad. Please inform your cleaning staff not to do this again."
"Good food options, love the old school economical rice in the corner, and a mix of newer stalls from Chinese dumplings to soft kaya toast,etc. Good variety, cleanliness well maintained, with the TEL entrance easily accessible."
Everything is available for shopping
"I came here during lunch time and it was crowded! I guess that means how good this place is. The chicken rice is a must to try, I love to eat chicken rice whenever I visit."
Places you need to go
burp! very nice taste for it's reasonable price 
Plenty option of food and crowded
The Muslim food is good here.
Yummy food
"If you like chicken rice or duck rice you can visit the food centre, the worst verity food centre in SG"
"Tried Wan Li Xiang Ji Fan,Personal felt that it's one of the best roasted chicken."
Good selection and tidy place.
"Nice food, accept card and cash."
"Shi Ban Yu Tang Wu Yuan Wu Jiao Suan He Li,Zhi De Chi,Hou Hou De Yu Pian You Wu Pian"
Nothing is nice here. Will go to Macdonald instead next time.
"Coffee queen, whampoa soya bean and Izah Rahman ayam penyet. Nothing else!!"
Affordable meal here
Go in the day as more stalls are open. Some good options here.
Delicious and cheap!!!!
"Variety types of foods, reasonable price and average standard"
As always still the best foodie place to go. Would hv been glad if only a vege food shop was there.
"Great food, famous Marine Parade duck rice. The spinach soup, dim sum and mixed rice are quite popular too. The chicken rice stall opposite the nasi lemak stall sells out by lunchtime, it's good and cheap. There's usually a queue at the coffee stall. Price of most items are close to food court prices."
A busy food center With a myriad of food choices
there's a craft shop which sells handmade plush toys! awesome find!
This became very very crowded on the opening of the TEL (Brown) line! XD
Have variety of food available
"good variety to choose from, good to improve ventilation and fans, could be stuffy when crowded"
The staff mending most of the stalls have some kind of attitude. A fishball noodles staff watching his phone when approached gave a unhappy look while  the Fei Yuan staff seemed unhappy to be asked about an item. I suggest getting rid of these unhappy workers to make dining there a better place.
"Tip Top Western food.
Ordered the grilled pork chop, yumm!! And very big portion!! Highly recommend"
"Nice hawker food and good pricing. Now with the mrt close by, it's easy."
Good place for different types of dishes with low price
Food choice is not great. Since MRT line TEL started. Business has dropped.
Plenty of food choices!
Best old school chicken chop 
Decent hawker center for meal
"Long established hawker centre, clean, well maintained, good variety of food and lots of surrounding shops, banks, that makes this a convenient point"
"I stay far away from east. It's been a while I am
In here. At times like that, it's rare to find hawkers who are generous with the serving and oh my the char Siew is thick and sio bak is shiok!

Many places I've been has thin looking Charsiew .
This stall makes tummy happy"
"Prices are on the higher end, but there's some yummy good food around"
Prices flying high
Purely for working ppl nearby... I tried most stalls ... All overpriced except chicken rice and most owners are snobbish and arrogant... Taste all msg ... Price is higher than normal Hawker 15% .. they are only friendly to tourist especially caucasian.. dn even try the mixed rice store.. dirty oil .. lousy salmon 10sgd .
Happy to be able to visit this hawker centre since the introduction of TEL to Marine Parade. The fish soup was good and reasonably priced. My favourite Whampoa Tau Huey is there too. The mixed vegetable curry rice must try!!
"""Craving for good Western food? Head to Tip Top at #01-22 for their mouth-watering chicken chop!

Juicy and tender, their chicken chop is cooked to perfection and served with a side of delicious sauce.

Paired with a refreshing salad or crispy fries, this dish is a must-try for any Western food fan.

Tip Top's chicken chop is a game-changer - don't miss out!

#TipTop #WesternFood #ChickenChop #Foodie #Yum""

""Tip Top #01-22 - try their amazing chicken chop, juicy and flavorful! Western food at its best!"""
"Great hawker centre, went for the breakfast from Coffee Queen. Our favourite coffee in Singapore (3 locations)"
"If you live a good part of your live in Singapore,  Marine parade is the best town to be in. People are more communicatable and have better economic social spread. When the going gets tough, go to the beach. The beach is or cause Singapores largest public space."
"Shout out to this really good niang tofu stall Jia Le.. ingredients are fresh and good soup

Most important the aunty that has been manning the store for years is polite, friendly N swift. Really a rarity for such hawker aunty nowadays

When I have a bad day..I come buy niang tofu from her..I feel better"
"Notable recommendation will be the Xing Long cooked food, Hassbawa mee goreng and coffee (opp Hassbawa)"
"Good, yummy noodles. Request for more chilli if you like spicy food. Uncle & Aunty shifted from Jago Close to Marine Parade Central Hawker Centre. Their Unit is 01-55. Operates 7 days a week. Do expect to queue. They have another stall located at Siglap coffeshop next to the Fairprice NTUC operates by their son and daughter in law."
"This store is at the back area, near the corner. In between a drinks stall and a stall selling breakfast noodles.

I really like the Yong Tau Fu here, not normally a big fan of Laksa but found the laksa gravy quite flavourful.

I also usually get alot more ingredients than usual.

One of my favourite stalls here for sure. "
Spacious hawker with lots of food choice. Great hawker
"Great food variety, duck rice, kuay chap, chicken rice, nonya rice, dim sum, prawn noodles, laksa, fishball noodles, nasi lemak."
Plenty variety of hawker food.
"The variety of food has improved this year. 2 new chicken rice stalls, 1 new duck rice stall and 1 new Yong Tau Fu stall. Quality of food are good."
very busy during the lunch time
"Many varieties of food, nice place for meals."
"MarineParadeHawker84MarineParadeCtrl (Marine Parade Central Market and Food Centre), 84 Marine Parade Central, Singapore 440084
* Central (Ctrl); see above
* 10 Aug 2024 Saturday which stall is Jospeh Schooling fried carrot cake?
* wonder still good as before? Neptune Hong Kong Dim Sum (Hai Huang Xiang Gang Dian Xin)"
I ate salmon 
"It's up to you to choose what you want or the variety of food you can choose from. But if you want to find a seat during the day and in the evening for dinner, you'd better hurry about half an hour early."
Clean and many varieties of food and drinks. Try the dim sum and the two chew noodle
"the food selection is interesting,i like the hainam,its different with other place outside singapore that sell hainam,its authentic.I also like the interesting and special drink and dessert selection.

The thing i don't like is the price quite pricy for food street but maybe its a standard price in singapore,also I really doesn't like the way the seller talk to the customer that I think its quite rude & not polite.

I know its Singaporean culture to talk rude & straightforward but if you want to attract tourists especially its located across the hotel,the seller have to learn to respect more to the customer/tourists."
Affordable food with good packaging.  Healthier option is available with brown rice option
"It's very warm and without air conditioning, but it's a great place for authentic Singapore food at local prices."
Shi Wu Jie Ge Pian Gao'Di Fang Hui Bi Re
There is a quite big range of food available at this food centre. The chicken rice seems popular with long queues each time I visit.
"Very near to east coast park. Right Infront of new Marine Parade MRT station. Plenty of local foods variety for all races.
Look for stores with queue for recommended foods."
Many food choices in this food centre.
"Good buy after long Q . Nice to eat even chill, better with the great chilli sauce."
"After a run at East coast park, joined friends to come here have breakfast.

There are many varieties of food to choose from. The dim sum got two storer, different by 20 cent as of 20240628."
Good food stall and other various items shop can buy as well near the city
Open air food court in Marine Parade with unique stalls such as Apollo char koay teow (wet type) and Emmanuel cuisine (ask for the blue pea rice).
"Convenient location,  just at the exit of Marine Parade MRT station. Good variety of foods."
"I came here on 27 Jun. The last time I was here was about 3-4 years back. There are many different types of food now which is good. However, the place is much warmer than before despite more installed fans. The recent warm weather has certainly contributed to it. Despite that, I wonder if the whole place needs to be torn down and rebuild with a high roof to improve air circulation.
One way to tell the difference in the warmness is for one to compare it with the coffeeshop at Blk 81 Marine Parade Central."
"outdoor, variety and the beach what else you need?"
"Charsiew bao texture  custard, too. Porridge garnishment crispy tho minimal century egg."
Cheap and great local food. Service and atmosphere is like that of hawker stall in market
Ventilation inside needs to increase. Fans blowing hot air.
" very very disappointed, having dessert at the hawker Center, when request for a small bowl to share the jelly with my sister because she is having cough, stall holder asked for two cents for the bowl. I am not asking to take away the bowl. Wonder is that the practice at this hawker Center?"
Cheap and Nice food at open air hawker centre just next to exit of Marine Parade MRT station
"Most of the previous hawkers are no longer there. Now they have a stupid tray system when u pay a fee to use the tray n when you return you collect the deposit back. It's a failure!

Recent visit here and tried some of the hawker food and below average."
Like to try every of their cooking.i would say a lot of variety n easily access too. No problem .
"Tried the dimsum, pretty good porridge and prawn dumpling. There is water cooler near to this stall. A number of stalls have closed."
"Very nice, clean well organised hawker centre with lots of food choice. Like the mee goreng very much."
These food court was renovated recently. Good quality and fair price also
"Looking good..
All things available, you desired .."
My neighbourhood. No complaints
Good varieties of food and nostalgic wet market
"Clean and spacious, with many seat available! Good choices and variety of food "
Good food with a lot of choices and is very near to a shopping mall Parkway Parade. Soon to have an MRT station as well.
"Not many halal stalls.
Disappointed."
"It's a busy Food Center. Plenty of food
Stalls. Nothing outstanding but still
Good to drop by for makan."
There are numerous stalls to select from. Came here to do a take away as I was rushing.
Must try their Popiah and Rojak. One of the best in the town.
The popular Fish Ball from Marine Terrance Market has finally added a Teochew fishball noddles @ Marine Central Market Foodcourt . The fish ball still very good believe over time this stall will bring back the Oomp of this food court like the former Apollo Char Keow Teow .
Almost everyday dinner. Working nearby. Uncle is very friendly. Many dishes options all nice. Price affordable. Most importantly fresh.
Hawker center cannot rate service and atmosphere but selections of menu awesome and try everything 
"Many good foods Stalls at this location.  Many stalls had being operating for over 30years and through few generations.  Hawker centre had went through some majors renovation recent years. Hence its now more organised, clean and airy. We visited on weekday evening around 6pm. Not crowded."
"HK Dim Sum, D'Authentic Nasi Lemak, Soya, Coffee Q"
Good and affordable
Very nice simple food and at very good price.
Food choices ok some of the prices quite steep. I think the coffee standard can be better.
"Lots of food stalls but the delicious ones finished early. Follow the crowd. If visiting off peak ask Residents, they are friendly about which opened stalls are delicious"
"Great atmosphere here in the mornings.
Busy, but still plenty of seats."
A lot of delicious foods! 
Not so good
Lots of different varieties of local food.
A go to place for all sorts of local food
How to rate this exciting experience. Would try every hawkers food if I could. Tasty colorful  great
Duo Yang Hua You Ping Jia
"Try this fish ball noodle, the fish ball is good the soup is hot enough to satisfy the term ""Freshly cooked"""
Lots of varieties and most of the food served are all very good! My favourite is the popiah and muachi (so soft and fresh). Food court is quite clean and spacious too. One of the best food courts thus far.
"Most of the older hawkers/stores were gone. A few better ones left are the zuo ji duck rice, one six eight (altho price 30% up) and perhaps the fish soup 2nd row."
Bien manger pour  pas chers. Il y'a beaucoup de choix.
Here are many food stalls... very convenient to ta-paw food to bring over to the beach 
"This market has a lot of authentic and comfort local foods. Cai fun (Xiao Juan), Popiah, Dim Sum..etc."
Many stalls were closed on Sat evening
It wasn't crowded on a Sunday morning. Many of the stalls were closed at 8.30 am. Reasonably clean.
"Really good food, wide variety and fair prices. Will definitely go again."
"Most of the foods are awesome 3 stalls chicken rice also nice.
Duck braised n roasted rice near the dimsum stall is nice.
Malay nasi lemak , indian 2 stalls also good.
Pang Pang Western newly opened damn really nice yet price very reasonable run by young brothers ."
"Tomyam soup has a spicy and sour taste, with a combination of fragrant herbs like lemongrass and lime leaves whereas horfun has a slurpy and thick gravy woth chewy taste ."
Great to share a mixed meal & get a taste of SG. Price belittles the quality.
"food, lontong, nasi campur etc,  vegetarian mee hoon, porridge and Chee cheong fun."
Nice fish soup and ban mian at reasonable price.
Nice food to be had. Self service. Can be a bit hot if not seated near the fans
Singapore hawker centre local foods.
"Bahasa Indonesia:
Ini tempat yang menurut ku wajib banget didatengi krn banyak sekali tempat makan murah, sampai mahal. Super seru sih disini, karena transportasi juga banyak dari mana-mana, kalian yang ke singapore tpi mau yg anti mainstream keliling-keliling marine parade itu menurut ku seru bgt. Sarapan di marine parade, lalu main2 di mall nya! BTW yang seru juga disini adalah ada kaya pasar tradisional yang jual buah-buah sampai makanan basah! You should deh ke marine parade kalo ke singapore.

English Language:
Indonesian:
This is a place that I think you really have to visit because there are lots of cheap, even expensive, places to eat. It's super exciting here, because there is also a lot of transportation from everywhere, for those of you who are going to Singapore but want to be anti-mainstream, going around the marine parade is really fun in my opinion. Breakfast at the marine parade, then play at the mall! BTW what's also exciting here is that there are many traditional markets selling fruit and wet food! You should go to the marine parade if you go to Singapore."
"Another great hawker centre, with a fantastic range of Asian food on offer. Something for everyone. And of course a great upbeat, bustling vibe. Try the chicken porridge. You will love it"
"Hawker facility, so service and atmosphere are appropriate for that venue.  Food varies from vendor to vendor but generally priced right with variety!"
"Great variety of food, drinks, and desserts. Conveniently location along Thomson-East Coast Line, Marine Parade Station (2024).
There are limited stalls open in the morning."
Marine Parade Central food Market was my last moments of paradise were I spent my 15days without home after my internship
"Food here is great. Loads of established and known eateries and the newer shops are good as well. Personally, we are huge fans of the dim sum stall - called Neptune if I'm not wrong. They serve hearty dim sums for a very reasonable price.

Right next to them is a well known roast duck rice stalls that is immensely popular with the lunch and dinner crowd. The popiah stall is also a lovely place to visit - it is tasty and not oily.

So, drop by this hawker centre for a lovely meal if you are in the area."
"Great hawker market with so many stalls. Came looking for a vegetarian stall that was sadly closed during our visit. Instead, we experienced Potato Queen's fried balls and Gula Melaka in peanut and coconut. Everything was fried and formed fresh and so tasty. The Gulf Melaka were a bit crumbly, but still very good in flavor."
Convenient but less options...
"The food and kopi drink stall in the first 2 picture is pretty good. No wonder the queue is consistently long. This food centre is airy and spacious, the best part is not much of oily smell. Wheelchair friendly. Table is always nicely clean up as i notice the cleaners here are proactive. Please self return tray or plates.

Taste is subjective, it also depends which stall you patronise. :)"
Good food at the local market. Affordable and tasty. Not the best ambience though.
Some good food stalls here with char siu options being my favourite.
Awesome food!
"Food expensive. Hawkers owner some are not friendly.
Atmosphere too hot."
You can choose so many things
"Having undergone some major renovation, the market and food centre appears cleaner than before. However, I am saddened with how many of the old good stalls closing down and are no longer in operation. The motivation to visit is not as high as before."
"Food choices are good and price wise reasonable. Only needs to be careful when paying for the food.
Make sure money paid and any extra changes returned to avoid misunderstanding."
"Newly renovated. Reopened in May '19, with many new stalls"

Had curry chicken noodles for dinner. Enjoyed it.
The hawker has good food selection..nasi lemak and lontong from D'Authentic is delicious!
"Good variety of food available in a verbal location. Prices are reasonable given these times of inflation, and portions are generally generous.

Like the fact that there are several Muslim stalls to complement the Chinese stalls. They sell nasi padang, mee rebus, nasi lemak, etc. There is also an Indian rojak stall. There are at least 3 chicken rice stalls in competition, and 2 roast duck rice stalls. Have tried Kun Ji which sells a plethora of braised items and roast meats starting from an affordable $4. Recommended. There is also a stall selling pig leg rice starting at $5.90. Two dim sum stalls for you to choose from as well. Popiah/rojak stall is popular too. The Chinese stall at the corner sells a nice bowl of beef noodles too.

Western food stalls, fish soup, ban mian, lou mee and economy rice are also available. Dessert wise, there is the traditional ice kacang, and Whampoa soya bean. Drink stalls sell sugar cane too. There used to be an oyster mee sua stall, but sadly, no more already.

The hawker centre is spacious and you will be able to find a seat even during peak hours."
Just few Halal food here. You can choose nasi briyani with large portion.
"Quite a few decent food stalls in the hawker centre. Pang pang western food, d'authentic nasi lemak, long chen wanton noodles (their char siew is great and this place is really under the radar for the quality) etc."
Lots of good food here. Reasonably priced too.
"Good variety of food stalls with reasonably priced good food . Good place for a fast meal, although some popular stalls waiting time may be longer than usual during peak periods."
Traditional hawker food
The food was okok only. Nothing special.
Food variety is common but there are few popular chicken rice stalls. The coffee stalls in the middle lane serve good coffee and cheap.
A normal hawker centre. Rather messy and dirty. Food quality is mostly mediocre.
"Hen Duo Dao Di Shi Wu Ke Mai,Le Sha Mian You Mei Liao,Zhe Huan Zai Gong Cheng Zhong,Xia Yu Dong Hai An Zou Bu Guo Qu Ke Xi Xia Ci Huo Ming Tian Tian Qi Hao Dian. "
It is very clean. The food options vary. They separate the halal and non halal dishes so it is safe.
very singaporean like
Wide variety of food. Recommend the fruits drinks stall at the front left corner. Very concentrated
"There are some decent food but a lot has discontinued cause the younger generations do not want to take over this trade as it's considered not worth the hardwork n sacrifice. U have a daily routine of more than 12 hours inclusive of preparation, cooking, selling n cleaning up."
Happened to look around for dinner and we never came here so we just tried out and found their maggi mee goreng is one of the best so far. I don't really much of a fan but the color of the maggi is awesome. 01-37.
Good Hawker dishes.
The duck rice is the best. Huge portion and very affordable. Bad thing is the hawker closes quite early around evening so u have to be early.
Crowds during lunch hour. But food is nice.
Good selalu ramai
Experience the local foods and fruits to try while in Singapore.
"The food centre have everything you need for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Chinese, Malay, Indian and Western foods are available with a very competitive prices."
"Ate there, drank there. I keep going back for more Coffee Queen drinks. Doesn't matter Teh or Milo. I really like it a lot!"
"I am an East-side boy so always feel v at home when having meals here.

Update. CKT stall replace w Bai Nian"
Hot.. need more fans. Air circulation is needed.
"Nicer since renovations esp with hand-washing basin before entry into toilets.  Hawker stalls usual individual units so service depends on respective owners or staff.  Generally airy with dry floors.  Variety of F&B stalls means decent choice available so not a bad place to have a meal, be it breakfast, lunch or dinner."
"Had the Whampoa beancurd and soya milk. It wasn't too sweet, unlike most. It's delicious served warm the way the stall had it."
"Quite a cooling hawker centres with lot of varieties. Today, had dim sum and yuan yang (white & black) carrot cake. Very satisfied with the hawker food"
Hawker centre. Sometimes hot and bit messy. Food from some stalls good.
Very good variety of food but can get quite crowded
The economic rice at the corner facing the bakery is excellent. Love almost all the dishes there and they offer brown rice option. Some may find that they are a little expensive but imo the portion and quality of the food makes it worth.
Alot of good food
We tried the Dim Sum and it was a really delicious.  The shrimp chee cheong fun was delicious. Should try that when you go there
"Halal Food Supply Limited.
Quality pretty bad.
Expensive for hawker food!"
Food expensive.
A tad expensive compared to other food courts.
"Very Busy Food Centre! Good mixture
Of local delights. Poor cleaners always on the move to keep FC clean n prompt.
Explore to carry on makan."
Now is closed but I used to have the best wonton mee ever. The place was very good for taking energy before the weekly shopping at marine parade mall.
"Well spaced with galores of food stalls
Quite crowded even at 8 am plus.
A well mixed of our local cultures cuisine. Explore to carry on makan."
Will come back for chicken wings but have to careful as the uncle keeps asking me to take more dishes. He concerned I don't have enough to eat. Thoughtful
Some nice food there 
The corner coffee stall operated by some Vietnamese ladies served excellent coffee. Thumbs up .
Good central place to eat and do other bits of shopping
Superb local food in Singapore
many stalls were closed
Close to where I always stay in Singapore.
Plenty choice of food. But hard to find seat
Wide variety of food but there are too many people who don't clear after they are done. 
Variety of food to choose. Drinks as well. Prices are acceptable.
Cheap and plenty of choice.
A good spot for breakfast and anything.

"Healthy vibes, wide food choices like most hawker centres in sg.
Clean n windy environment
Budget/wallet friendly"
I like this hawker centre. Find it quite clean with good selection of food.
I like the chicken rice.
Neat N Tidy
Airy and clean with many popular food stalls
Good variety of food at reasonable prices.
"The newly renovated food centre is good, well ventilated and bright, with wide variety of good and affordable food! New ""return-your-tray"" system is good too."
Love to buy take away from here. Tried many of the stalls over the years. Not everything is good but each stall has their own delicious dish. It's just a matter of finding out which ones are good to eat
Great delicious home cooked food and reasonable price though long queue start at 11am-1pm.
Busy @ quick
Like the Apollo char kway tiao
Popiah is good.
Good food and prices
Unsatisfying Chicken Cutlet Laksa $5 meal..  firstly the laksa had no taste.. very watered down. Secondly the Chicken Cutlet had more flour than the meat itself. It looks like the meat is purposely packed with additional flour layer to look like a thick chicken meat.
Apollo FCFKT - a must for Fresh cockles Fried Kway Teow lovers - especially those who love garlic  expect a queue as with all popular stalls. 
"Nice spacious, new stalls however turnover as rental high n need shelter to Parkway to tap office crowd for lunch on raining days. Nice coffee stall, as grind coffee beans fresh n owner v meticulously. The coffee set with Kayak toast n two half boiled eggs $3 a weekly ritual."
"It has got variety of local, Thai and Malay cuisine, taste is good portion size is sufficient, once in this area try local food at reasonable price."
"It's the usual hawker centre food stalls...but not all stalls are open especially in the evening. Here to buy mee goreng .
Haig the urge of eating Indian mee goreng...
Happy goreng !!! Happy people !!!"
"The Char Kuey Teow is gd and Soup like kidney, and pig stomach avaable plus Peranakan Food too"
All the food stall not as good as last time. Don't waste time eating there
Not much food in the evening. Most food seller calling a day
Nice & clean market.
Always a nice place to find nice dishes. Not as crowded as before.

"Fantastic hawker centre, everything here and not a thing overpriced"
"Overall okay, average cleanliness, reasonable amount of varieties, tried Fried Kway Teow, not too bad if you like a bit wet kind of Fried Kway Teow. Muar Laksa not worth to try as cockles quality is bad!"
"Similar stall in Ang Mo Kio area with the specialty Ma Bo Lor Mee (Ma Po Lu Mian). Tried the Laksa with Chicken Cutlet, gravy is average.

The star is the cutlet which is freshly fried, juicy, and absorbs a good amount of gravy."
Food is ok. Cleanliness needs improvement.
"Had lor mee, was okay cheap for 3.50"
Used to be my hang-out place when I was in secondary school. A decent range of hawker fare. Not terribly clean though.
"Good market to buy local groceries, food and household goods.. there are also small shops selling fruits, on sale goodies and knick knacks.. there are salons, diy shops, TCM etc."
"Marine parade central is a typical normal hawker centre with few special foods - mee goreng is pretty good with 2 stalls and both tasty. Theres Dim sum too. The popiah stall is a bit different where the popiah skin is home made with texture that's nice and also sold separately by weight, min half kg."
Nice variety of dishes to choose from. Love it!
WILL RECOMMEND STILL BUT STANDARDS APPEAR TO BRE SLIPPING!!!Love the place after its renovation. Brighter and ventilation appears better. My favourite stalls are the Whampo Soya Bean and the Apollo Fried Kway Teow. Crowded but still possible to get table and seats. The prices have gone up and portion size has shrunk. The corner Economical Rice is still Good!
Mrt almost ready. Crazy durian fire sale or price war over there.
"Clean place. Most of the stalls in the food centre were closed at 8am in the morning. Not much variety. Ordered from Xiao Juan the economical bee hoon with luncheon meat, ladies finger, otah and omelette. Everything was below average. The bee hoon was bland and tasteless. The sides were mediocre."
Awesome Nasi Lemak
Foods above average and affordable pricing
Good choice and wide variety
"This muah chee has soft chewy and sticky glutinous flour dough cut into small pieces and coated with fine grated peanut powder and sugar giving it a nice light crunch. Balanced tastes with just the right amount of sweetness. So yummy Must try  
#MarineParadeHawkerCentre"
The char kway tiao is awesome and the coffee is memorable
Great food court.
Tried the char kway teow and fried carrot cake today 
"Good and realiable choices all around you.
The coffee along the same side with the dim sum, serves a good cup of hot coffee. Solid kaya toast too.

Dimsum, Apollo Fried Kway Tiao, kaya toast set. A great meal before a walk to east coast park, before the afteroon sun."
"This food centre has lots of good local food. There is a variety of Chinese and Muslim stalls to choose from.

There is chicken rice, mixed rice, tim sum, noodles, peranakan food, nasi padang, desserts....etc....etc..

Not forgetting a wet market just next to the food centre."
"It's a convenient and accessible place, about food got a lot of choices and they got more tables so nothing to worried and it's not that so very crowded..."
"Nice medium size outdoor market and hawker, just across the street from the Parkway Parade mall.  A bunch of hawker food choices, household item shop, local bakeries, and fresh fruit produce vendor."
Good local Chinese and Malay hawker food.
"The mee sua at this stall is good! First time having their oyster mee sua, oysters were fresh. Owner was friendly."
Lots of economical food options to choose.
"24 Mar 2022: Apollo Fresh Cockle Fried Kway Teow...you have to love garlic to enjoy this popular wet version Char Kway Teow.

19 Feb 2022: D'Authentic Nasi Lemak...flavorful chicken rending, chewy sotong, fragrant rice, crunchy peanut, crispy ikan bilis and the sambal provides the power...a little pricey but it sure is Yummy!

02 Nov 2021: Spacious, plenty of choices and at reasonable prices. Tried the Donbori at Fukudon and they got 2 very satisfied customers."
"#01-10 You Ji Ya Fan, horrible and disgusting hawker stall I have ever been. Service is bad and unfriendly. Attitude is the worst I have seen. Seem like he is the consumer  and I am the worker. Feel like telling that uncle if not happy of the job, don't work lor, stay at home better. Extremely disappointed.  Sooner or later will chase all the customers away. Not recommended to this stall."
Bright and airy after upgrading.
Food price a little high expensive. Especially the corner mix Curry rice very expensive.
Nice clean and airy! Good food too
Teman makan enak
"Clean hawker after last renovation. New automated clearing tray system, but pls rem to separate the cups from the tray else the machine would have dump the cup and break it.
They should just make the same type of automated tray clearing conveyor belt system like Tampines hub kopitiam."
The place looks OK to me
"Lots of nice food here and tables look to be easily available for small groups of 2.

Congee, vegetarian, Thai food and the kolo noodles are really nice..

Try it if you are here.."
It's just the charm of marine parade.
Clean and well-maintained. Choice of food is ok
Whampoa soya bean very bad expensive and taste even worse. Better don't try.
Good test  . Chicken so nice
Yong tau food and spinach soup was super good and delicious.. Worth the money
More spacious and clean looks
Best nasi lemak ever at Daunthentic Nasi Lemak
Simple hawker fare here. Queen coffee has great viet coffee that even a non-drinker like me will crave for it at times.
Jin Dong Qu De Yi Ge Mei Shi Dian
"Near by parkway parade hawker. Food is nice and my favourite stall will be Kun Ji Ya Fan. Flavourful braised duck and soy sauce rice. The food in hawker a bit pricy and limited choice. They have nice kolo mee selling over that but the portion is small, remember to add additional noodles just $0.50 for it. They have nice nyonya cendol too. The Taiwan mee sua so so only. No tasty byt the portion is big. The hokkien mee is ok and big portion. The hainanese chicken rice very nice but i think a lot of MSG, after eat i felt very thirsty. Overall for me is fine."
Poor Service 
Found this newly open bakery store #01-38  in Food Centre. Good quality bread and castella cake. Our young and old at home love the castella cake. Will come back again.
Most of the Stalls Owner having some Attitude Services
Good variety of local food at very affordable prices. Place is kept clean and hygienic. Some of the vendors have been around for over 30 years.
I had lam's signature's salt baked chicken thigh with rice. Its rather dry and tough. Service is not warm and friendly as well. I've been to the one at Waterway Point many times. It's chicken thigh has always been tender & delicious. Service has always been warm & friendly.
Spacious food centre with many seats but was control due to SMM. Slightly more expensive than toher hawker center.
Nice and friendly hawker centre
"Awesome stalls: the dimsum, Peranakan, vegetarian, and Malay food ones"
Good kaya toast thr
"Wow! plenty of great food here. For Mixed vegetables rice stalls, you can find excellent quality at Emmanuel and Xing Long stalls, though prices are slightly higher ($5+/-) than other stalls. There are about 7 or 8 coffee stalls here, but go for Teck Siong and Coffee Queen, their coffee and tea are fragrant. Authentic Nasi Lemak ($4+) is really traditional and authentic."
"The Cai Fan stall here is my must-eat! (Xin Long, the one with long Q) Price is very reasonable and the dishes are tasty! The food Center is clean also."
Good place to have lunch dinner or breakfast. Good variety of food includes local dishes to fusion food dishes. Lots of people during lunch time.
Good environment to shop and eat
"One lackluster aspect of the Hawker Centre is the lack of option for Halal Food, there is only 4 stores that provide Halal food Option. So friends who are looking to hangout with your buddies please do take note!

Other than that, I find that there is many food to enjoy in this hawker center. From your most basic mixed rice with vegetables and meat to a Japanese Rice Bowl, it'd be able to satisfy most of your cravings.

Individual Reviews will be given.

But overall this Hawker Center has my thumbs up.

Just do take note there is monthly cleaning, so do check out the NEA website to ensure you won't waste your trip down here to have a meal."
Price are getting too high....for the Allah stall.
A good place for cheap lunch in Marine Parade Central
"Quite airy and spacious. Many stalls, including some halal food. Tek Siong drink stall has a unique way of doing half-boiled eggs. Apollo char kway teow is famous; it's quite garlicky and nice but not amazing. But there should be something for everyone."
"It's one of the cleaniness hawker centre in Singapore comparing the same size and crowd. Clean tables, no sticky feeling table tops and seats. Utensils and tray returns are very well organised which let the cleaner focus on their works in keeping the environment clean and pleasant. "
Quite a number of nice foods
Wide choice of food. Mostly chinese & local food.
"Both duck rice stall is awesome!
Apollo Char Kway Teow is too garlicky :("
Food at here so so
Many food stall to choose from. You will see some store with no queue while some are long queue. Seats are limited due to cov19 situation.
"First time here having travel far from West to East (Jurong to Marine Parade via Bus).

Surprisingly there are many well-known hawker stalls in this 84 Marine Parade Central Market and Food Centre, and conveniently located to Parkway Parade Shopping Mall. Not sure why there's a signboard indicating this place as ""Promenade Market @ 84 Marine Parade"" ?

During this current covid-19 pandemic, I noticed that most stalls closed early around 7pm - 8pm, instead of the usual food centre 10pm closing hours.

There's a wide variety of cuisines - Chinese, Malay, Indian, Peranakan, Thai, etc in this Food Centre.

Notable stalls to try out for me are:
- Traditional Oyster Mee Sua stall at 01-29.
- Emmanuel Peranakan Cuisine Stall at 01-30
(understand the chef used to be from Xing Long Cooked Food)

Do take note of the usual Spring Cleaning of Market and Food Centre islandwide. The next spring cleaning here will be from Monday 6.12.2021 to Tuesday 7.12.2021. Resume business on Wednesday 8.12.2021.

There are also several automated Tray Return System (ATRS) launched by NEA in this 84 Marine Parade Central Market and Food Centre."
Roasted chicken rice stall facing the ocbc is my top 3 chicken rice stall.
"Many convenient stores and a food centre. A big Fairprice store and a shopping mall. One MRT station under construction, original planned completion date will be in year 2025."
"Reasonable price and many good foods.
I like popiah roll at the front of hawker"
No comments
"Renovated in 2019, this hawker center and market has good food options, it is bright and clean.

It has some famous hawker stalls there that has been there for generations. Depending on whether you go there for breakfast, lunch or dinner, our favourites are Apollo Char Koay Teow, Kun Ji Duck Porridge and Neptune Dim Sum."
"Great place with surrounding neighborhood shops with lots of variety and array of stuff.

Food was enjoyable and tasty with variety of choices."
"At blk 84 there are many gd foods too i/e : chai fun, malay rice,Peranakan mix rice, duck rice char kway keow & few more you must try to believe thanks"
One of the best curry rice/noodle that you can find in Singapore! Great portions and chef (yes Chef) has a super friendly and approachable persona. A definite go to if you're craving curry with rice or noodles.
It was very good and if you haven't been there your not a real Singaporean haha I incourage to go there some time .
"Flavourful seafood soup, similar to Yan Ji in Marsiling hawker centre. The prawns are big and supple. Prawn heads filled with red roe. 
Teh halia also v rich. There's really the kick from the ginger!"
Clean hawker centre and it is very airy. Food there are also nice so definitely a good place to head to.
"Nice bright and airy food centre, good selection of stalls."
"Decent, not fantastic food. Parking easier with the new multi storey car park. Quite crowded especially during peak hours like lunch time. Coupled with the new COVID rules which limits 2 per table. Checking in and out quite easy though."
"OAR (Old Airport Rd) Seafood Soup, previously known as Yan Ji Seafood Soup is here at their new store #01-50 and they are as awesome as ever. Pictured here is the smallest bowl which was barely enough. Next time I'll just go for the larger bowl. Shiok. Google Map has no info yet. Closed on Wed."
love the sarawak kolo mee
"Yi Ge Xiang Dang Xin Qie Qing Ji De Xiao Fan Zhong Xin,You Yu Yi Qing De Guan Xi,Zuo Wei Bu Gou,Ting Che Fang Bian."
"Stalls near the toilets  serve good food. Duck rice, dim sum, western food,"
"Inside this newly renovated hawker centre, it is now cleaner. I like the mixed vegetable rice with variety of delicious meat, vegetables to select. The stall is at the corner, nearest to Parkway Parade shopping center."
"Nice Kopi Sui-Tai (less sweet), lowest price among the marine parade hawker center stall next to Thailand food stall. "
Hokkien Mee is gone :(
"Good variety of food there! Should try Apollo Char Kuay Teow, liao!"
"The food are good. Yong tau foo with spinach is excellent. Dim sum is reasonable price and nice. Must try the Hainan boneless chicken rice. The Tip Top Western food is good. The Apollo char kway teow standards has dropped. Too soggy, at time, too sweet, low grade lip cheong. Chendrol and bean curb is worth trying. After renovation, the seating are well organised, ventilation has improved and quite bright. Be prepared for some cocky and arrogant hawkers!!!"
Lots of food selection. The zichar stall is nice and fairly priced.
"Yummy meesua and chili oil dumplings, a good place to get your Chinese food fix."
"Food choices limited, used to have some great stalls. Not anymore"
Seems like ghost town after nea upgraded the place.
Staff very friendly n helpful. Items very easy to locate.
Great variety of food and clean and neat. Well ventilated.
reasonable prices but limited number of stalls compared to bigger one like Tiong Bahru
Hen Hao Hen Gan Jing
many local and nice foods here
Not much options for dinner
"Not recommend for dinner time, as most stall close early."
Very delicious Nyonya Nasi Lemak ~ 
Things slightly more expensive than other hawker center.
Visited second time. Like the Apollo char kuay teow but it was rather expensive at $4/$5/$6. Lucky if you find a small piece of hum on plate!
Porridge very nice.

Nice food here... Please come and visit... 
I was there last night after my walking exercise with friends. We arrived before 8pm and most stalls were already closed. It's even difficult to have a cup of coffee let alone any nice food around by then.
"This food court has a good location in the busy East side but only a few stalls worth trying. Recommended are the ayam penyet /tahu goreng , pork porridge, dim sum, fried cockles kuey teow, fried carrot cake, mix veg rice. Stalls should make effort to improve quality to make this centre popular to East Coast Park visitors"
The place was packed and cleaners not in time to clear the tables.
"Loads of variety and the place is airy and clean. Staff very diligent in clearing the tables even though they also do encourage you to return your trays; trays can be gotten with 50cents deposit and will be refunded upon tray return at the machines.

Some must tries are the Nasi lemak, lontong, cai peng, char kway teow, fish soup, dim-sum and the curry puff!"

Dim sum there is good.
Lots of vareity off good local food near east ciast beach
"Ordered Soi 84, Thai food.. Phad Thai is one of the best I've tasted!! Service is also good and friendly! "
Being a while since am here and can see a lot of changes with renovated market and food ctr seatings and new food stalls.

Re-opened recently. The place is quite messy with used plates and bowls left on the tables. Tissue paper and leftover food strewn all over the table.  Many tray machines around but customers are not using them. NEA must think of better ways to ensure cleanliness. Customers must be incentivize to keep the hawker clean.
"Love that place after the renovation. Food wise, Im disappointed with Neptune Dim Sum; Siew mai was far from tasty. Same goes for the har gao despite the price. Apollo char Kway teow was excellent! A wide selection of food which are reasonably  priced and the location is just great."
I seldom take Char Koay Teow but this stall the CKT take awesome although it kinda wet. The Chinese sausages they put into the CKT is very generous. Give it a try next time you are here.
Gd selection of food... prices more towards foodcourt prices.... abit stuffy for the seats facing inside
Good cleaning
"Similar food sold in other market around that area taste better and cheaper. Can understand the rental would be higher since its at parkway Parade but I think the food quality should also be good else ppl would rather not dine there... I have been there for more than 10 years, I never seen crowds or people queuing for certain stalls, that should tell u the quality/popularity of the food there..."
Newly upgraded. Toilets are clean. Only a few halal stalls.
Best teh halia
"Nice airy hawker center that has a unique tray return system. Lots to eat and choose from, as with all hawker centers in Singapore."
A resonable mix of local food at affordable price.
Ample space and good food
Very bad with the construction going on.....
Many choices
Cheap food with lots of variety
"Zhe Li De Guo Tiao Mian Hen Hao Chi,Jing Ji Shi Hui. "
"Traditional Oyster Mee Sua , Singapore version!  Very nice."
"Variety of food stall you can chose from. Braise pork dishe, vegetable and white rice cost sgd3.50 onward. Soya milk from sgd1 onwards. Walking distance to East Coast Park seaside. Next to Parkway Parkway shopping centre and next to Parkway centre famouse for tuition centre."
Emmanuel services the most reasonable Peranakan Food...Constant long Q
Variety of food available. Vegetarian food is included. Chendol stall is popular.
"Since after renovation done, stall holders closes much early then before, Nothing much to eat nowadays. Pathetic"
Many nice food
Place is clean and many food to choose from
Pretty good hawker food. Love the cendol stall that opens only during the day.
Great food. Char kway teoh. Best
Convenience and food is a good variety of local fare. Not cheap but of normal  hawker pricing.
"Lots of cheap and delicious food. The char siew bao from the neptune Hong Kong dim sum stall is soft and the char siew is not overly sweet or salty. Also tried the apollo char kway teow, overall is quite tasty but the raw garlic taste is too overpowering. The hawker is clean and spacious."
Alot of choices
I like the Marine Parade Central because it is very confidence places.
"Spacious airy hawker center. Must try the japanese  fish soup (facing the shops), very good"
The hawker looks much cleaner and comfy after renovations  Most popular stalls are still there. Ordered nasi lemak from D' authentic as usual but price seems to go up. Food quality still same though. Just look at the price before ordering. 
"The food are not bad,but no western food"
"This food center and market had been upgraded and is more spacious and generally brighter, and made it a better place to eat and have a short coffee break. Eco Toilets are bright and clean. As a result, it is popular."
"Wide variety of food and also all amenities of banks, market, shopping, clinic, movie theatre nearby."
"Airy, clean and ample seatings after upgrading."
Food is good and nice
I am work in parkway parade .Mei Ci Qu Da Bao Dong Xi Chi Shi Wu Li Mian Du You Tou Fa so sad  Xi Wang Nu Huo Nan De Mai Chi Du Dai Mao Zi Bi Jiao Wei Sheng please
Generally fine. But one or two lost their smartness when they expect their smartphone guide them around.
Everywhere over there are good beverage & food and lots of choices...
Wohoo! Love this economical breakfast set. Even though the Ngoh Hiang is a bit too much flour. Q
"Xin Jia Po Ben Di Shi Wu Hen Hao,You Bu Shi Xin Feng Wei. "
Good food.
Many shops were not opened at 5pm on a wednesday
Delicious char kway teow!!
Good spinach soup
Most of old stores r remain. Some stores worth trying
"I like the You Mian from 77Ban Mian. 
Can give it a try if you're a Ban Mian fans"
Nicely renovated
2 vegetarian stall to choose from
Great place to dine
I like the roasted meat stall and the fish soup stall
Very good place. Clean and tidy. My citrics list hawker.
Tim Sum is good.
Place are clean n good. Food are good too.
Lots of choices for good food.
Good food.
"Opened after months of renovation. One of the few hawker centres that actually improved after renovation. Cleaner, good stores are still around and some good new stores too."
Never Never patronise Mabo lor meeMa Bo Lu Mian#01-18. The store owner attitude is the worst I have seen. Anyway the food is below standard. That's why they are selling so cheap!
Tasty tasty
"Bright, clean area with fair variety of food choices."
Very good food and reasonably priced
Local Singapore delicacies
"there are other hawker centres which i prefer. As such, i give it a rating 2"
Ok ok food
"The place was dirty, my Char Kuey Teow was ridiculously spicy and the drinks stall used disposable cups and straws."
"Very limited variety of hawker food. Many items not available like prawn mee, satay"
"Clean, airy and has a good selection of hawker food. Tim Sum was good, but a tad bit expensive. Apollo Char Kueh Teow was garlicky and flavour was pretty good."
"Lovely hawker centre to have meals.
After renovation looks more spacious.
Many stalls to choose from!"
Many choices of food
The chicken rice is the best that i used to eat here till the hawker closed for a year plus for renovation. Glad that its back and also the popiah and duck rice also good
"Love it, so much choice and it is generally a very clean place. Lots of fans around for ventilation so it doesn't actually get too hot either."
Good food. Not warn today.
Good choices of food from different culture and people groups
More than 50% of the stalls were close when I was there at 1815 on a Friday night.
"Bahrudeen biasa definitely was worth the travel! Best rojak in singapore without fight. Spicy, sweet, sour. Cant complain. Affordable too unlike the places at west coast"
The wanton noodles store is nice!
Great selection of food
A lot of good foods and shops around. But the trays returning is not really effective and convenient.
"After upgrading,somehow it lost its 'kampong-like' atmosphere. Loss of some of the familiar food stalls n the increase in Food prices.
The tray return stations r a constant souce of irritation,inconvenience n confusion. Don't sit near the station..Irritating sound of trays/plates/bowls as it drops into the bin. U can't enjoy yr food in peace n quiet."
Much better after renovations
Only a few very good stalls. Try nasi lemak at d'Authentic. V dood.
Great place to est. Food is cheap and place is spacious
"One of the cleanest food centres I've visited. Was there for breakfast. There were very few stalls opened. Had the famous nasi lemak, and shrimp cheong fun from the Tim sum stall. The cheong fun was ordinary. The rice roll was too thick and not smooth. Nasi lemak was also ordinary. Had better ones. The chilli sauce was good. The rest were ordinary and the rice was too hard. Perhaps it's not a place for breakfast."
Newly refurbished. You have to try the black and white carrot cake shop here. Its so soft and smooth and amazing!!! A lot of other tasty food too.
Aziz Putu Piring added new flavour -Durian $2.70 for 03 pieces
the food here so so only but the price is a bit high
Limited food options after renovation.
Used to be a place full of good nostalgic food.
"After some renovation, this place now more comfort than before."
I was in this place just for my employeers daughter tuition.
Spacious and clean hawker centre. A lot of variety stalls.
"The market and food centre opened after a long renovation. It is bright and airy now. I liked Shanghai  store,  lemak, vegetarian and chwee Kueh. Good  from stall beside chicken rice and both Dou Hua stalls.

The tray deposit of 50C/ required is really troublesome to manage for stallholders and customers. One time, the machine did not work and we had to wait to get our money back."
clean. yummy food.
"Affordable, clean, one of-if not-the best and nicest looking toilet in all the hawker centre in Singapore... nice food and ambience. It's Saturday evening, 6-8pm and there are plenty of seats. They also have family seats."
Great food
"This place sells comfort food.
Very localized area. Good for family gathering and has lots of seats available.
Food pricing are affordable"
Crowded food court...
"Good variety of food, clean with reasonable prices."
"Newly renovated hawker centre is much more airy, bright & spacious. Seats are also more handicap friendly. One thing bugs me and many people the most is the fans!! There are too many and on full blast so your food getsre cold fast, your hair is all over your face when u eat. I see many patrons like myself looking for tables to avoid the strong fans but it's almost impossible. So not environmemtal friendly!"
Good environment
"Wonderful old wanton noodles, spicy hot chili sauce! HOT!"
Amazing place to eat and hang out! Best places I have been in a long time!
"New hawker centre has a clean new feel, with the same good stalls."
"Freshly renovated, some old stalls are no longer around. Overall, more spacious, airy with new tables and chairs. Some tables can seat quite a number of pax. Good mix of food available at affordable price."
Plenty of seats available and lots of food choices to choose from
"After its reconstruction of the food centre, there are more seating area & the centre is airy & spacious. What attracted me most is the provision of long oval-shaped tables for big group of diners to sit together & have a fellowship meal. Though food prices had gone up, (due to the high rental), food prices are still affordable. However, there are many stalls selling the same types of food like the beverage stalls. There are 8 coffee stalls at close proximity."
clean and large. more easy to find table at lunch time. various kind of meal you can choose. reasonable price.
Got two vegetarian food stores where I do go for breakfast.
Newly renovated cooked food and market centre. Wide variety of good cooked foods. The wet market has less stalls now. The fruits and vegetables stalls sell good and quality fresh supplies.
Clean & wide variety of food. Affordable prices.
"Many varieties of food to satisfy your taste bud at affordable prices. Friendly stall holders and spacious airy dining area to relax with your meals. BEST OF ALL.....the wash room (male) with greenery is refreshing, dry, clean and no foul stench around."
Fan Xin Hou Duo Liao Ji Dang Xin Shi Wu!
Newly renovated. More airy. Brighter and Clean. Lots of variety of food
Many choices of food.
"Foods & Beverages halal as well as non-halal available for breakfast, lunch and dinner."
just a few good food
Nice place
Food is cheap. The duck rice was nice but char kway teow was so-so only. Don't  know why food king gave it 3 stars.
Renovated not long ago. Charges refundable deposit of 50 cents for tray when u return utensils. Recommend the Peranakan food between the Char Kuay Teow and Chendol stall
"Good food,cheap price"
Nice and clean
Great Food
"Quite a wide variety of hawker food here affordable price. Chinese, Muslim and Indian food available.  Western food available as well but saw this in the evening."
"Pretty standard hawker fare. So far, Hollywood chendol is probably the only one that stands out. Fine ice and thick and solid gula Melaka makes this one of the best chendols around."
"This Cendol (or Chendol?) is nice. It has its own unique unassuming look but it tastes great nonetheless. Freshness of the green Cendol (or Chendol?) reminds me of the version at Old Airport Road hawker centre, the one I still prefer."
"Good food, lot of choice at the hawker center"
"Love the buffet spread. Need reservation though, as the place is popular."
"After recently renovated,  looks cleaner , brighter n much bigger! Still got my favorite apollo fried kuey teow! It's the more wet one and you eat with a spoon."
"Good place got M&S,Iseten and big giant mart"
All time favorite..being my childhood hangout after YAMAHA art and music classes. Chin Chow aunty still recognize me!??
Limited range of food.
Much better after renovation ! Get to see the Singapore Hawker Center Culture
Birds problem otherwise 5 stars.
I love this Hawker Centre. Excellent halal food choices.
"When we came here, most of the shops were either closed or about to close. Was disappointed as I didn't get to eat my Apollo fried Char Kway Teow. Well, will try to come another time."
"Highly recommended especially to tourist. Great place to experience cheap and authentic local hawker culture. Food to look out for Chicken Rice, Wanton Noodle, Char Kway Teow (fried rice noodles), Tim sum, Soya Bean Milk, Roti Prata, Indian Rojak etc."
Lots of local hawker food. There is a dim sum stall and fried char kway tiao stall very popular
"Hao Chi De Cha Shao Shao Rou Fan,Zhi Yao SGD 4,CPZhi Gao"
I like the mee rebus and mee siam. The chicken rice and ayam panyet is also famous. The food at dim sum stall is tasty. Many drinks and snacks to choose from. Good combination of malay and chinese food and drinks. Value for money and quality is good.
Nice spacious and comfortable
Lovely place to meet friends
Got to taste local dishes at very reasonable price
Loved the variety and quality at very cheap.prices
A few nice stalls here too try
"The food is fantastic, I've not been in this area for a long time. But always the food quality never fails. Absolutely great food"
So many chicken rice stalls! Need more varieties.
I would love to give 3.5 stars. The char  kway teow is wet and garlicky. Full of aromatic pork lard and dark soy sauce. The cockles are well cooked and just enough Lap Cheong to add to the experience. Some may not like it. Some will love it.
Plenty of new stalls. Better then before. Must visit then you know this place.
Should drink the hot beverages from the shop next to the western food. Somewhat better tasting.
Lots of diffrent foods that are good and it is newly upgraded and is modern
"Many food stall and good taste
Good taste soya bean"
Looking and tasting great. Will come again!!! Great fresh dumplings and noodles at CHINESE NOODLES stall.
"The Mutton chop here is the tastiest! The meat is cooked well and not tough, coupled with the sweet of the mutton chop sauce, I finished up the whole plate in minutes! The egg is done perfectly too, sunny side up and you can dip the mutton meat into the sunny egg, yummy "
Hass Bawa serves the best soup kambing in Singapore. Their mee goreng is good too
Nice food at nice price
"Good and clean, just re-open from upgrading..."
"Nice food at reasonable place. Newly renovated and reopened, clean and well ventilated. Toilet is avail free."
Some stalls disappeared after the recent upgrading like the curry puff & beef noodle stalls. Those left which are worth trying are the Apollo fried kuay teow & Xing Long mixed vegetable rice
D'Authentic Nasi Lemak.
A fee nice stalls. But a little small and closes early in the evening.
Variety of different things and types of food!
Good.. Just finished refurbishment.. Clean n tidy...
Good choice of economical and tasty dishes.
"Tried the Thai food stall, tasted good & price reasonable. Was shocked by the price of the containers charged though."
A wide variety of hawkers fare
Excellent local food!
"Well renovated. Better ventilated, much brighter and the tray return system is brilliant."
Airy and spacious. But less choices with lits of empty stalls.

"After the upgrading, the food centre looks more spacious and airy. It has few tray return machines to collect the used utensils. It'll be good if people used the machines so that less birds will be scavenging for leftovers.
I still love the nasi lemak and coffee here although the price has gone up by 10-20 cents. I guess the rent has probably gone up for them.
I never used the old toilet before upgrading but I find this new toilet very spacious and nice. Maybe too spacious, could have built more cubicles instead!"
The tray return kiosk does not work! stupid idea!
"Everything that I ordered here was tasted really good ! If you're looking for traditional Singapore food served by locals, look no further ! However, do note that most of the stalls close by 7plus in the evening on a weekend so come earlier to try all of them ! (Took away 1 star due to this)"
"Good old days, with the new look n same food stalls."
Best upgrade ever....yummy vegetarian food  (stallx2) within the same hawker center.
Lots of food choices and great food
Great mix of little shops and a largeish market and hawker Centre
Just renovated. Better environment as compared to last time. Wide choice of local food.
"Lots of different kinds of food in the food centre. V clean place. Tried shui kueh. 1st time. Love it. Also bought the tarik, not too sweet. V.  Nice!"
The wet char kway teow is just as good. Not as garlicky as before?
"After renovation it's clean, spacious n not so stuffy"
"This is hawker ctr. It caters all types of cooked foods after an extensive upgrade. Bigger spaces, more tables n chairs and airy. Food prices are quite reasonable. Many old stalls came back to occupy old spots. Worth a visit."
"We ate at the Yi Lu Fa Hong Kong roasted meat and at the Haianese chicken stall. Great,juicy and tasty hawker food. Especially the hianese chicken is really good!. We cant stop eating it."
"Cheap, tasty food"
"Apollo Fried Kway Teow. It's one of my favourites, and a clear winner if you like it wet. $4 doesn't get you much, and the eggs aren't obvious in the plate, but what you'll see are large broad strand of almost translucent rice noodles generously coated with sweet brown sauce and little bits of garlic. The result is a perfect blend of moist and sweet Kway Teow quite unlike any other.
Business is always good, but the hawker here is Very friendly and even finds time between stirring his wares to chat with the customers:)
I highly recommend this place if you like me are a CKT fan:)"
Clean and airy hawker Centre after more than a year renovation. Good food and good price.
Completed renovation recently. Neat n tidy.
"So glad this place is open again, but the variety has taken a step back.  Less to choose from, more stalls selling same dishes."
Came here for the Nasi Lemak
Multiple good stalls with long queues
Nice but very expensive after the renovation worst is the apollo fresh cockles fried kway teow used to be $3 small portion now $4 increase by $1 but portion even smaller and too wet.
Really good food
Typical hawker centre. Its a new one replacing the old hawker centre.  However some of the old food stores are no longer there....sad
Great place to relax
"The food court recently opened after renovation. Big, airy with ceiling and wall fans. Nearby also the washroom. Great varieties of food to choose. But pls check well the prices before placing your order. Nearby is ntuc and parkway parade. Next to it is Macdonald."
Clean and bright....
"Hawker is squeaky clean, 50 cents for rental of trays (ughhh).

No idea about food but I wouldn't go for this ginseng chicken soup again.. big slab of chicken but not a shred of ginseng.. soup is like hot oily water..."
"This place has finally reopened on 1 May 2019 after a spate of delays. However, quite a number of empty stalls can be seen & some are still renovating. A few stalls have moved away permanently though,but the Popiah stall is back & Apollo Char Kwey Tiao is open for business already. People residing at Marine Parade can rejoice again as there are more food choices to choose from now. Still have to wait for a while more before all stalls are open for business.
Food Republic at Parkway Parade is expensive and some of the stalls there serve food below par, especially the Thai stall, Formosa La mien & the Korean joint. Therefore, the Marine Parade Food Centre is good news for diners."
Re-opened. Some previous stalls are still there. But the market now have an electronic tray return station. Quite cute. But you have to pay a small deposit of 50 cents when you order food. Only after you have returned your trays at the electronic tray return stations will you then get back your deposit. Great way to get people to clear their trays and keep the place tidy. Otherwise the whole place will be so messy and birds will start flying in to feed on the leftovers.
Pin Wei chicken rice quite good . many people queuing also
Just renovated. Reopened on 1st May 2019. Most stalls not operating yet.
Good choices of local foods available
Closed for renovation
Currently under renovation but by end of 2018 should be done and definitely recommend to try the hawker stalls there
"So many things to choose from, I love it"
Now is closed open again March 2019
Now under renovation
Korean food okay
A lot of good food and ample seats in this food centre.
Currently undergoing renovation untill 1st Q of 2019
Nice food.. But under renovation now
Food items are overpriced.
Marine Parade Food Centre was closed for Renovations untill 2019.
"This food centre cum market is closed for renovation starting from 1st March 2018, opening 1st quarter of 2019."
The centre is closed for renovation works till the first quarter of 2019.
Please take note that the hawker centre is closed for a year for renovations.
There are different food stalls and many tables are available for use.  Many birds wandering for the food left on the table.  There is no vegetarian food stall but I can find limited food.  A quick meal at low price is suitable here.
Closing soon on the 28th Feb for Major upgrading. 1 year.
"Good food, great variety & reasonable prices"
"Hawley centre, famous with Char Keow Teow and Braised Duck Rice."
Very little to offer for vegetarians
"This place used to be great in the 80s. Sadly, its dying."
Must try the nasi lemak. Just look for the queue :)
Roast pork stall with long queue is worth it
Has a lot of food outlets
Always enjoyed the food there but once hit upon a  rotten egg in a stall was really disappointed
"Various items, taste ok..."
Easy to navigate around this hawker centre. Lots of yummy food here.
"The hawker place is pretty old and you can see that some stalls are left empty as well.
Cleanliness can be better.
Whenever I visited this hawker place, I feel that it's very hot. Maybe it's due to the low ceiling and lack of ventilation at the hawker.
For future renovation, increasing the height of the ceiling will be helpful."
Alwys no place to sit
Good food all around
"Lousy food, lousy hygienic conditions and limited seats."
"Zhu Ming De Xiao Fan Zhong Xin Yin Ci Yong Ji Mei Shi Zhong Duo,Jiao Tong Fang Bian,You Hao Duo Mei Wei Ke Kou De Ben Di Mei Shi,Li Ru Ji Fan,Chao Zhou Yu Yuan Mian Deng Deng,Jie Ge He Li,Shi Xun Zhao Mei Shi De Hao Di Fang Ye. "
Good place for hawker food good and fast pitty not all stalls open till late
Good and cheap food!
"Good and affordable dining options, but will be undergoing renovations from February 2018."
Awesome food and teh tarik!
Marine Parade food centre has a good selection of low cost local delights catering to the neighbourhood. A couple of the more popular stalls include the Lee Heng chicken rice and the adjacent spring roll stall. It also has an adjoining wet market.
Very nice shopping market.
Small but convenient location
Need to clean the floor.
Great old school hawker food here. Place will be renovated for about a year from Feb/Mar 2018
Variety of food to choose from.
Can try the Char Kway Tiao and Popiah here :)
Old school hawker center with a wide selection of food.
Good selections of local food. Near a large mall.
Is a pity next year moving out giving way to mrt and no temporary area. No more food center around that area.
"Great and cheap food. Been here since my younger days. Prices stays the same since. You can get Indian Mee Goreng etc for $3.50 onwrds at Hass Bawa. Great Chix Rice, Fried Rice & Beef Fried Rice from $3.50 onwrds at the shop beside Hass Bawa. There is Malay shop on the front side. Great food. The Nasi Goreng Kampung is the bomb equipped with Fried Ikan Bilis on top, crackers on the side, Sambal belacan and garnishes.. look at the photo."
Chinese muslim western food available + thai outlet across
Not a wide variety of Halal food options
It was an awesome place! Cheap good food and the atmosphere was great! The fish soup there was delish. They are open early in the morning and best to go during lunch or up till 5pm. Usually not so good for dinner as some places are closed.
Good variety
"Quite warm and slightly dirty. Otherwise good, wide array of food choices."
There are food that move you.
The bean curd stall facing out ( nearer to NTUC)- like changed owners? Or same? Their signage definitely changed .  But price went up! And quality went down :(
Lots of authentic food there at reasonable prices.
After the renovation it feels much better. Plenty of mouth watering food there but always go for the Fried Chicken Rice in the malay stall in the corner - faves.
A lot of good local Singapore food here. However environment is not very clean
Great place to dine for good value local food.
"Good place for authentic local cuisine, albeit with horribly humid, hot, and dark atmosphere of you're seated on the inside.
This food centre and market is rather old, and has not been upgraded for as long as I can remember."
Local food centre with many acceptable price for halal or non halal food and drink

 Vibrant local hawker centre vibe, crowded on weekends
 Cheap & cheerful food! Salted fish fried rice here is pretty tasty & runs out pretty fast"
Good cheap but really uncomfotable. Really worth it. Will be there anytime.
Good food but mostly only in the day. Most of the stalls close at night. The chicken macaroni stall is great for kids!
"Food Recommendation!

1. Thai food
First strecth of stall near to end,  their Tom yum soup and fried rice is epic!

2. Indo food - Dapur Mama
If you are Indonesian food lovers or even Indonesian, you have to visit them and their cook will helps you with homesick.  Price is superb affordable 
Their Ayam penyet and Indonesian fried rice is a must to try!  But fried rice a bit salty tho.."
"Pretty popular hawker food, however a bit pricey."
Wide variety of food. Hawker catering to the heartland of Marine Parade. Delicious cuisines at affordable prices :)
"Great breakfast economic bee hoon, nasi lemak and cai png"

Plenty of traditional food offerings

Tables were dirty

plenty of hawker food options. super packed during lunch though.
Good food.. nice place

many delicious food stores here. i highly recommend the ban mian facing the shophouses selling for $3 a bowl. prices hasn't increased in years and it tastes fantastic
You can find many good food at affordable prices here.
A landmark of sorts by itself. Many local residents of Marine Parade cannot image life without this hawker centre.
Good food selection
Good times
AWESOME food.
It has good food! Like the wanton noodles and chicken rice..
The facilities are old and the seatings limited. But the food is great especially the Apollo char kway teow
must try the famous beef noodle and yong tau foo here
You can find good food there. The price there compare to other hawker centre is quite reasonable.
one of the old but great places to get food no matter what your taste and appetite!
Plenty of local food offered. Should try the famous rojak.
"Food, food and more food. Good desert stall that you should try when you are there."
Good and cheap hawker food

Opposite Parkway Parade
Quite a nice place to have local cuisine.
Wide range of delicious food
"Best of all things in one places. Almost all the banks branch are located here. From food to shopping, they have it. Can't get enough? There are heartland shop houses just right across the road."
Always full of crowd lor
"Historic hawker centre (>50 years I was told). Good selection, reasonable prices. Some items you don't see elsewhere. Good atmosphere."
Good variety of food

loved the food choices
Food are at the high side here.
Lots of good food.
"A lot of choices, nice and not pricey."
"historic hawker centre. decent food, great place for the budget conscious."
"This Food Centre is preferred over the Food Court at Parkway Parade for its food and prices. We particularly liked the famed Mr Wong Seremban Beef Noodles, previously from Amoy Street, which has an excellent rating from Makan Sutra. Their beef tendon dish ($5.50 per bowl) was delicious and the serving was generous. Try their thinly sliced beef ($3.50 per bowl) with either thin or thick rice noodles.  Eventhough the stall opening hours is from 10.30 am to 9 pm, the stall will close for the day once the beef noodles are sold out. It pays to go early! "
"From rojak to char kuay Tiao, wanton mee to nasi lemak. Everything you name it, all you can find it here. Price is cheap as compared to other hawker centre."
"An old school hawker center with great range of local foods including Muslim food   The famous char kway tiao stall is here, but may not be open all the time."
There's something for everyone to suit their budget. Great local food.
Slightly dirty and hot but cheap great food found here from cai peng to roast meats to halal food.
good price
Good choices but is slight pricey compared to other hawker centre.
"You could have spicy foods,chinese dim sum, indonesian fried rice, thai foods and malaysian foods.you have all in one place.prices are 3S$  to 10 S$."
Food ok but not good
Come we eat together. it's a ideal place for dine.
"Fish ball stall, bee bee carrot cake stall, xian yi porridge stall and others they have been here for long time. Good n cheap."
"No one clear the left plates on the table, comparing to other food center, this is considered as very dirty and difficult to find a seat.

The three stars is given to a yummy Chao Guo Tiao store which you will locate it when you see people queuing "
"Staple hawker food centre for the locals and visitors. Plenty of choices, come during lunchtime and dinnertime for maximum selections. Will have something for everyone, and cheaper / tastier than nearby food court inside air-conditioned Parkway Parade.

Shame if you want to eat healthy (i.e. if you want to get your 4 to 5 portions of fruits and veg, and sweet tropical fruits DON'T count), here's probably not it."
"Small hawker centre with lots of good food! Beef noodles, fish ball noodles and Char Kway Teow!"
"This is the jewel of the Marine Parade estate and it's not just because it's the only food Centre here. There are many must try food stalls here. Malay Nasi Lemak, Beef Noodles, Chicken Rice, Neptune Dim Sum"
"Like any food centre, place is crowded and not air-conditioned. MPFC is home to several to notable stalls, such as Tong Going Fatt chicken rice, Mr Wong Seremban Beef Noodle and Apollo Fresh Cockle Fried Away Teow. I'm a fan of the former two, haven't tried the latter."
"Tong Fong Fatt Hainanese Chicken Rice is a Must-Have, just buy the $2.50 portion will be good enough.

The soya bean drinks stall just 20 metres away has the best soya bean drinks and beancurd in Singapore."
A nice place to find the food and the price also reasonable
Ok food would recomend
Alot choices of foods. You will be spoilt for choice
"A good local hawker in Katong.

The fish soup and roast meat stalls are my fave. You can feast here for under S$5!"
Typical Singaporean hawker centre. Popular dishes there include the char kway teow and chicken rice.
"A place to enjoy great local foods...don't miss the red wine chicken mee sua, ayam penyet, chin teng, and many more!"
"One of my frequently visited hawker centers. You can get quite alright good for a very good price. My personal favorite stall is ""Grandma's Recipe"" (#01-182), which has very good food if you like to have a meal that includes some veggie"
"Mei Shi Da Pai Dang,Niang Dou Fu,Hai Nan Ji Fan,Lao Ban Dou Hua,Shui Gao,Bo Bing Du Hao Hao Chi"
Large variety of local food. The char kway teow is special (wet & peanuty). Seremban Beef Noodles is also a must try
A lot of food to pick from. I love it
"Mei Shi Zhong Xin,Zheng Ti Huan Jing Yi Ban,Lao Ban Dou Jiang"
"Best Hokkien Mee and Hor Fun.  Our family loves  the Chinese Malaysian food in Johor.  After two years of Covid, we really miss some dishes, such as the Hokkien Mee with dark sauce and Hor Fun.  Qian Wei serves the best version in Singapore of these dishes, in our opinion.  So hard to find Hokkien Mee in Singapore with the dark sauce, and done right with thick noodles.  The Hor Fun is also great.  My wife is Chinese Malaysian and very particular about local food.  She loves this stall as well.  We hope to try other items soon.  Thank you!!!"
"Tasty zichar and one of the nicer food in the Marine Parade central hawker centre. The nonya fish head was fresh and fish meat is flaky, no fishy smell. At $16.80 only. Curry had nice refreshing pineapple cubes and assorted veggies to compliment the fish head. We ordered a salted egg pork chop rice, tasted average (I guess was from instant powder) except the sauce could have been richer."
"A tze char stall in marine parade hawker centre. Each dish is about $5-6, portion is good for 1-2 person. KL noodle is not bad. However not all dishes are good, for example salted egg pork chop doesn't have the salted egg taste at all."
KL dai lok mee was good! There were a wide variety of dishes at very affordable prices! Good value for money for sure 
The staff is nice and good quality food!!! My favourite 
"came here a few times and this stall constantly draws a crowd. Basically they sell zhichar. They have your standard horfun and fried rice.a quickly sweep of the menu, most of their dishes are between SGD4-6 each. We ordered a total of 4 dishes with rice, total meal came up less than SGD$25.

The dish that stands out the most have to be the garlic clams. For SGD$6, the portion was really generous, most importantly it was delicious.  They have set meal available as well."
Food is cold and taste bland.
Taste is vastly different from the previous old couple who manned the stall. It was quite a rip off for the chicken for a 2 person portion. Unlikely to be back again
A good old Cantonese style porridge that goes well with their silky smooth white chicken with liver. Highly recommended.
Old school chicken rice. Very smooth chicken and meat texture is good. 
Was wondering why the food tastes better these days but there's no longer any queue. Read the reviews and realised there was a change of hands. Chicken is now more tender and the sauce no longer has a strong alkaline taste. Priced at a very reasonable $4.
"Not value for money, portion is small and rice is cold. Taste is ok."
"Visited on Saturday 10.30am with no Q.
Nice old school chicken rice. No frills n simple."
"A classic culinary delight, the poached chicken stands out as one of the finest I have ever tasted. Its exceptional quality surpasses many of the offerings from renowned restaurants."
"It's a nice chicken rice. It's not the super tender kind but is with some firmness. Eat with chicken skin, rice, and chilli, so good. Their chicken are rather big, and thus, the cuts are bigger, too."
"Ate the pork porridge here one morning on my trip home last month. I am still dreaming about the creamy old fashioned bowl of goodness with an egg whipped in. Tender tasty well marinated minced pork! It was the best and hope this couple will continue this stall for a while more.
It can get crowded later in the day but at around 9 am on a weekday it was still ok."
"Change of hands, porridge no longer nice, chicken smell"
"Stall has changed hands months back. Quality no longer as good and this explains why there is totally no queue now. The porridge is now so watery, no difference from drinking salty water! While the Aunty who used to do the cooking previously hangs around at the table outside the stall, she no longer does any of the cooking. I have been happily patronising the stall for years but today's experience was horrible, which made me write this review. Ordered the chicken porridge as usual but instead, told the other Aunty who was taking orders that I wanted the egg to be mixed into the porridge and fully cooked, along with less oil (as I haven't been feeling that well). Repeated myself twice. I'm sure I spoke audibly as she acknowledged with a nod but she seemed more interested in getting her own question answered - whether I needed a spoon to go along with the takeaway. The Aunty cracked the egg into the container as usual while the man doing the cooking just added usual quantity of oil and soya sauce. After cooking, he poured the porridge into the container with the raw egg. I then questioned the Aunty didn't I asked twice for the egg to be cracked in and well cooked. She gave a blur expression, thought for a while, before the man poured the porridge with the raw egg back into the pot to recook. When I ate the porridge at home, it is so salty - seems to be double or even triple the amount of salt content! The current stallholders seem to be just there to pass time. As seen from another recent review below, they don't seem to care about customers' simple requests and cannot even follow such simple instructions. No longer the good old porridge cooked by the previous Aunty. A pity indeed."
"Heartbroken. A change in ownership. New uncle did not stir the porridge long enough to be thick. Clumps of rice sticking together could be found in the porridge.

A legacy the previous aunty and uncle built down the toilet with this group of new owners."
"With the new owners taking . It's very bad. Dishonest. Told them I do not want egg in my porridge , yet when they served, they insisted it's okay to eat egg and refused to change!! Ridiculous!!!!!!!!!!!!! No wonder there isn't a Q anymore !!!!!"
Really good plate of old school chicken rice. The chicken is not your super tender and soft type because the owner use large chicken so it is more on the firm side. The rice and chilli is average and prepare to queue and wait during peak hours.
Old school steamed chicken and porridge . It's very very good. They have been around for many decades. Pls support !
"Opens early in morning. Comfort grub. Nice piping hot bowl of chicken porridge. Just enough ingredients. It can be quite salty, and overly doused with pepper, so ask to go easy on these if preferred."
"As some people mentioning, yes the gong-gong and po-po who were running a store weren't in the stall and relatives were operating.

Ordered the pork porridge and wings, liver worth $8.50 and was surprised how fast they prepared the dish as usually took 3 times more.

Flavour of porridge was a bit off then what I tasted before but adding soy sauce and sesame oil tastes closer.

Still a thumb up to them overall!"
My go to porridge place as $3.50 gets you a bowl of porridge with eggs. But it's been a while since I returned given long queues and was shocked to see chicken prices nearly doubled...will think twice before going there for the chicken as I love the texture. The chicken rice is a little soggy and so would not bother.
"For all the regulars of Rong Ji who noticed that there are different people mending the store, it turns out to be the Aunties family! Her sister is helping with the business. Rest assured that the porridge taste the exact same as before <3 Favourite menu item is the Pork Porridge!"
"I bought their pork porridge for only $3.50, with an additional 30 cents topped up for takeaway container.

Upon ordering my meal, the nice old lady scoops up a portion of plain porridge from a large black pot and heats it up. She then adds bits of minced pork meat, and seasons the pot with soy sauce, sesame oil and dashes of ground white pepper. She then pours the contents into my takeaway container and tops it with a generous amount of Youtiao (Chinese crullers). The porridge was of a slightly thick consistency, not too salty, a little pepperish and savory which makes it a joy when paired with tasty bits of Youtiao and well seasoned minced pork.

Though it lacks the freshness of spring onions, it was an overall hearty meal with your traditional blend of Chinese seasonings at a really affordable price. Would recommend."
Is it closed for good already?
"Had chicken rice with chicken liver ($6.80) for breakfast on 11/3/24, was good!"
"Chicken porridge was pretty thin, does not have the usual consistency of your typical cantonese congee. Porridge taste was also average. But every spoonful was rich with ingredients, making it hard to rate this porridge. So four stars just because of the generous helpings of ingredients."
Chicken rice cheap and good but ONLY ACCEPT CASH! Put a signage lah!
"Decent chicken rice. It's like those chicken rice your grandma makes on weekends for the whole family. Chicken was tender and rice looks pale but was actually pretty tasty. Porridge was nice too, not too watery and full of umami flavor. Only complain is the price. Half a chicken costs $19 which was quite overpriced. Rice was $1 each. Porridge $3.50 and includes the take away box. Also the elderly couple was quite slow, which explains the queue. Oh and they only accept cash."
Superb chicken rice!!! Everytime I come to Singapore I will have to eat this!
"Came back this morning, for my extravagant childhood breakfast - a bowl of steaming porridge with an egg and a plate of poached chicken. Yums, so comforting, and all for $6.50!!!!!

Grew up eating from this stall when it was in a coffeeshop along Joo Chiat Place. Fragrant rice, liver and soft succulent drumstick meat in generous portion for $6.80! Will strongly recommend you to order a bowl of porridge (if you prefer your rice to have a bite) along with a plate of chicken meat!"
"Elderly couple selling delicious porridge at affordable pricing. The porridge tends to be prepared towards the saltier side. Do ask for less salty if you like them more blend.

I usually order the steam chicken to go along with my porridge when I can with my parents or in bigger groups. Very value for money. Few dollars for a big portion of chicken meat."
One of the best chicken meat In SG thankfully Q still ok in the morning. Price is reasonable. The chicken porridge compliment it but the best is still the chicken meat. Will go again for the chicken rice next round.
"Always see a queue whenever I pass by. Eventually decided to try their chicken rice.
Unassuming plate of food, but the taste was fantastic. The chicken meat was tender and juicy. The rice was fragrant and moist, and the sauce drizzled on top was delectable.
The amount of meat is just enough to tickle your taste buds and leave you wanting more. At $3.50 a plate, I think the portion is completely fair. Would recommend getting an extra serving of chicken to really enjoy the meal!
The chilli looked slightly watery, so I was pleasantly surprised when I tasted it. Packs a punch! A bit of minced ginger and a spritz of lime... Oh my, that would be amazing."
Queue for 45mins for porridge.
"Indeed the best porridge in Singapore.  The stock is really umami and well balanced. Small bits of soft minced pork that is well marinated without any strong marinade smell.  Even the yu char kway is nice, slightly thinner than usual ones and crispier, with slight hint of sesame oil.  Blends very well in the porridge.

We also order 2 people's serving of boneless chicken.  It is soft and tender, perfectly cooked, accompanied with crunchy cucumber slices and slathered with a blend of soya sauce, stock, sesame oil sauce.

Lines here are long as people tabao 4-7 packs at once.  Every single bowl is made singly, with loving care.  So please be patient.  They might get grumpy occasionally as the stress of managing long lines is quite tough as they grow older."
Old School Goodness !
The service speed is as fast as the elderly owners could manage which is appreciated. Porridge was too salty though.
"Drawn to this because of the constantly long queue, and found out that it was largely because the porridge was made fresh upon ordering!

The old couple working the stall must be in their 70s - churning out plates and bowls of chicken and porridge to keep the business going. And at an affordable price of $3.50 a bowl (which includes an egg), the prices were super affordable!

The porridge was very fragrant and smooth, topped up sesame oil and light soy sauce while reheated, and a good spoonful of youtiao alongside the generous portions of chicken slices - it was a perfect combination for a hearty porridge!

 I also ordered a separate plate of chicken meat just to give it a try, and it was properly tender and generous in serving too ($4 for what was in the photo).

 the chilli however was the only let down, but the sauce is so good that you don't need this at all 

Definitely will return to have this again - at $7.50 for the porridge and the plate of chicken, it's bound to leave you filling full throughout the day!"
The food is very nice.
Best porridge I ever had in Singapore 
Stale chicken with soggy rice overflowed with sesame oil..I eat 2 mouthfuls and give up
True comfort food! Had the chicken porridge which came with quite generous amount of shredded chicken and also you tiao. You will get ingredients in almost every scoop. The chicken is tender and porridge flavour is quite tasty. The steamed chicken looks good too and would like to try one day
"Nice porridge and tender chicken, long queue"
"On a cold and rainy day, nothing beats a piping hot bowl of porridge.

This stall in Joo Chiat area has been around for ages. Their porridge is silky soft, load of ingredients and their boneless chicken is literally one of the best in Singapore. Auntie cooks the porridge orders one by one. If you ask to add an egg, she will mix in the egg white while the porridge is cooking and pour the broth into the bowl containing the egg yolk. See my video. Somehow the porridge is more silky and you have a nice soft chew from the egg white. Pork porridge, chicken porridge, fish porridge...they are all good.

The chicken is so tender and Uncle takes the trouble to debone every piece. Drizzled in soya sauce and sesame oil, the fragrance is incredible. Chilli is also quite nice but not the star of the show. I added chicken liver and chicken heart. Both were equally good, the former firm and creamy to chew on, the latter crunchy. Not funky taste at all.

The queue is long in weekends and moves very slowly. I waited 45 mins for my order but it was worth it.  Parking is also very limited."
"Super Comfort Food For Anyday of the week... 

Good Combination of Pork Porridge + Steam Chicken Meat... 

What can be more warming... Hehe... 

Can be a long Queue on certain days... But most of the time you get to eat within 15 Min or so... 

Gotta Go Try It Out For Yourselves... "
"CLOSED TUES AND WEDS (see my 630am pic). They need a way of updating opening hours online, perhaps partnering management or other stalls to do so due to tech barrier. Terribly disappointed."
"Yummy chicken rice under $4. Chicken is cooked well, tender and tasty, rice is a bit on the mushy side and the plate is drizzled with soy sauce. Strangely every element that seems out of place somehow fits into the dish just nicely.

This chicken rice is very different from the typical chicken rice some may be familiar with in Singapore (such as Tian Tian, Boon Tong Kee etc). The rice is not fluffy like the usual chicken rice, instead it is always a little mushy. But the rice grains are well cooked with garlic hints. The drizzling of soy sauce seems lazy but it could just be an old school method of flavouring the dish / it could also be the technique that the stall owner here uses since they also serve porridge which uses soy sauce drizzling.

The highlight here is the chicken. Cooked to perfection each bite is extremely tasty. The chili is not very memorable but the dish itself is sufficient. Be warned that the dish does not come with the typical side of soup but this is where the wetness of the dish comes in to save the customer from dryness. I always order soy bean milk from the neighbouring stall to wash down the chicken rice.

Run by an old couple I am not sure how long it will continue to be around. Good chicken rice at very affordable rates. Always visit when I am
in the area.

It only operates in the day and closes at night. So be sure to arrive early.

Parking is very limited. Sparse lots can be found across at the police station and adjacent roads around the landed property estates."
"Best pork and chicken congee anywhere in the east by far, lovingly prepared by a couple in their eighties. Pair it with an extra portion of their silky Hainanese chicken on the side and you've got breakfast that's hard to beat. Be patient as they do prepare the food a portion at a time, and the queues may be very long."
"Pork Porridge with Hainanese Chicken. Their chicken was not that fantastic today and I cannot figure it out why but their porridge is still a super treat.

June 2022

Steamed Chicken + Pork Porridge. Managed to grab one of these last few fresh chicken birds before Malaysia handed us the unpleasant news of imposing a chicken export ban. The porridge is a great way to eat the fresh nook instead of the usual rice fare."
"Rong Ji Ji Fan*Zhou
Saw the queue whenever i visited this hawker centre during weekend morning.  Decided to give it a try.  First time having chicken rice and porridge for breakfast.

The chicken was very tender and tasty.  It was so good that I even ate the chicken skin which I usually would discard it.  The rice was not oily but fragrant enough.  The chicken porridge was surprisingly good.

Will order pork porridge the next time."
"I really like this chicken with porridge. Only downside is the wait can be long as it is run by a couple senior in years. However, to me, it is always worth the wait."
"Hugely popular rice porridge (aka congee) hawker stall in an affluent area of Singapore. As a lifelong lover and consumer of congee, the pork congee made for an unbelievably satisfying breakfast on this fine Singaporean morning. The portion is rather generous and I especially enjoyed the chopped youtiao sprinkled as a garnish over the dish. The stall owner was also very friendly and accommodating even though I only spoke English. Will definitely return in a future trip back to Singapore!"
Old school chicken rice and porridge. The chef is already 76 years old and still meticulously prepare the delicious food
"Had this after sightseeing at Joo Chiat Road by the recommendation of the locals. $3/portion.
Tender chicken, fluffy rice, fragrant sesame oil and not too salty soy sauce on the chicken, spicy sambal.
Will revisit if I ever go here again :)"
"Best chicken rice ever. In my opinion the cleanest stall, very fast and delicious. For your info, this stall closes every tuesday and wednesday."
"Old couple with son running the stall.
The menu also includes mined pork porridge with egg. Chicken taste smooth & yummy "
"Start selling fr 7am. Stop selling once sold out, can be as early as 12+pm! Will be back to try more"
one of the best porridge in sg
"Been following them since Joo Chiat Old coffee shop early 2000s.
One of the best White-Boiled Chicken rice served by Hainanese folkies. This dish of superbly tender juicy meat will keep you wanting for more!

I recommend a plate of Drumstick and especially a bowl of their signature Chicken Broth Silky Porridge to go along.
Couple is of age and hope they're here for a loooong time to come.
Note that opening hours are short from 0600hrs  and kinda close almost or midday. That's how worth and good it is......"
"Jelly-like and super soft chicken (to order, just ask for $10 chicken/Ji Shi Kuai). The chicken slices are super tender, moist and light. Porridge is creamy and with a light fragrance. the egg yolk is put in last, creating a nice gooey texture when mixed."
"The prices for the chicken porridge and chicken rice is unbelievable in this day and age given the portion that they serve. It's $3 per item and an additional dollar for chicken gizzard.

The porridge is warm and soothing while the rice was a bit too soft for my liking. Queues are long and may take a while because the stall owners are getting in on their ages, hence patience is required if you want to try their food."
"Why there's always a long queue for their poached chicken?

So, today I came during lunch hour and started queuing at 12.15pm, Infront of me there's 8 people in line. I was very hopeful to enjoy a good plate of chicken rice.

After queuing for 15 minutes, the guy infront of me warned that there might not be any chicken left when the one and only last whole chicken is taken to chop! I was crossing my fingers for those Infront don't order half or more.

Nearing to 25 minutes, I finally get to order my plate of chicken rice and 2 packets for takeout. The last few chicken meat could probably sell for another 4 plates to hungry customers.

Visually, can tell the rice is not cook with chicken stock, it's simply just plain white rice, and it's very moist or bluntly very wet rice. Too much water has been added to cook the rice.

Poached chicken on my plate is quite little, compared to my packet of chicken rice. Frankly, taste wise is kinda ordinary, and the sauce could have been better, lacking sesame oil fragrance. The chilli is average, and a little salty to my liking.

My children each have a packet of chicken rice and both shook their heads and quoted ""not nice"". One said my school chicken rice is nicer. "
Sold out at 12pm on a Tuesday. Buyers beware.
"Came here to try their Chicken Porridge, but the chicken was all sold out. Their pork porridge had a very good texture and balance. Definitely have to come by earlier to try their famed chicken porridge. Personal rating: 8/10."
"Great chicken that's tender and moist!
Come early for your chicken fix!"
"Cheap & Good.
Steam Chicken tender & moist
Congee well done w egg thrown in."
"White plain rice drizzled with soy sauce and sesame oil, top with overcooked boiled chicken."
"Silky smooth chicken doused in a sesame sauce, just look at how much chicken is given for just $10.50! Incredible value

Porridge was very smooth with pork bits and an egg stirred it to make it utterly unctuous.

The rice is plain with a hint of chicken so top it with some of the sesame sauce to liven it up

There is queue but it moves fast and I got my food in under 15min"
"Craving for chicken rice, ended up in Dunman Hawker Center as I was around the area. Always long q regardless of timing, need to have patience to enjoy the old school boiled chicken rice/porridge. Opted for chicken porridge with egg and 2 drumsticks instead as I love the way aunty cooks it, just like the way my grandma prep for it. Very well flavoured and silky smooth porridge, the egg and fried dough just elevated the intensity. The drums are tender but a bit salty (soya sauce). You could asked Aunty not to over saucing it if you prefer blender. $11.50 is definitely very affordable!"
"Tried once at the old location and I remembered their succulent chickens usually sold out by noon.

$3 comforting goodness with shredded chicken and egg included, added $5 worth of juicy breast. The only missing condiments are you tiao and spring onion.

Queue time: 1030-1130 on Saturday morning.
Definitely worth the wait."
The rice is super fragrant and tasty. Not the kind where they just douse a lot of seasoning kind of tasty. You can tell that this rice was cooked in good broth to bring out the fluffiness and flavour. The texture of the chicken was good for me. With just enough bite and not too tender. We also got chicken porridge with egg in it. Love Uncle's signboard stating that eggs are not returnable... why would anyone return them?? The egg gave the porridge good flavour and we loved the texture of the porridge.
This elderly couple selling simple porridge and chicken really have a good following. Was there at 6.45am today and there were already 3 person in front of me. Order the porridge and a side plate of drumstick and chicken liver. Simplicity of the minced pork porridge (with egg) and the flavoursome boneless chicken goes well together. Total damage $7.50.
"If you are looking for traditional old taste Chicken Rice, then Rong Ji is for you. I just love the tender chicken and fuffy rice. So old school taste that brings back tons of memories"
"Had the privilege of a friend packing a bowl of porridge and chicken for lunch.

The porridge was average and so was the chicken. Perhaps not quite my kind of taste."
"Dishonest old man.  My father was there to take away a whole chicken and not only did the stallholder pack less than 1 chicken, he mixed in parts that were probably leftover from the day before.

So what my dad received was half chicken that was fresh and less than half made up of odd parts that were clearly leftover from the day before (texture, colour, etc.).  Either that or the stallholder sells mutant chickens with less than 2 wings and 2 drumsticks per chicken and half of it is a lot more bony and discoloured.

Will not patronize this stall again."
"Great tasty smooth porridge. Chicken meat are fresh and tender. Their chilli is fantastic. Sometimes the queue can be quite long, but definitely worth queuing for it.
Have been following this stall since when they were at a coffeesop along Tembeling Road."
Sinfully smooth pork porridge and steamed chicken...
The porridge is thick and the chicken is great.
Congee is smooth and quite tasty. Tender chicken. One of the better ones at this price point.
"The poached chicken here is wonderful! Soft ,tender & smooth.The sauce they use over the chicken compliment it well. The pork & chicken porridge we ordered was quite appetizing,reminds me of the old school taste in the 80's... Worthy to try ,tops !!"
Love the super smooth creamy porridge here. Always have to queue for a bit but it's worth it. Price is the same with or without egg. Interesting huh!
Food look ok.
"2nd level on Dunman Food Centre, this Chicken rice and Porridge always spot a long queue from Breakfast to Lunch. Its not so much the great taste of Hainanese Poached chicken, but the combination of the smooth Poached chicken with the thick and flavourful porridge. On its own, the Chicken is smooth and tender but definitely not the best Hainanese Poached Chicken. It is also drenched in a light soy sauce sesame oil much like the Cantonese style but it went very well with the flavourful porridge. The porridge is thick and consistent, with crispy small bits of youtiao topped over your porridge. Only thing missing is probably some nice fresh cut spring onions and this is a champion breakfast or lunch for porridge and chicken lovers"
"It can be considered cheap for a plate of chicken rice at $3. However, they do not use the typical fragrant chicken rice for their dish; they use plain white rice. Quite a bummer, to be honest."
Simply delightful..
Nothing spectacular. But just simply well made simple no frill comfort food.
"Was at the food centre about 11.30am & there is already a queue of 5-6 people at the stall. Since it was close to lunch time so decided to give this stall a try. I was intending of getting a plate of chicken rice but seems like almost everyone is ordering a bowl of porridge & a plate of poached chicken. So why not join the crowd?

There are only 4 items in the menu (or rather stated on the board) : Chicken porridge, Pork porridge, Fish porridge & Chicken rice. I ordered Pork porridge with egg ($3) & a plate of poached chicken ($3). The price of the porridge is the same regardless with or without egg.

The porridge was smooth & small pieces of minced pork were very well flavoured. The amount of soy sauce & pepper added by the old lady prior to handling the bowl over was just right. The poached chicken drenched in the sauces are tender & very good to be paired with porridge & also on its own. The mouth feel might be a bit ""rough"" though, but still soft & tender.

There is this general old school feel about the meal & overall leave you feeling very comforting & satisfied."
I think it was quite over rated for their chicken rice. It was a little too salty cos they drizzled too much sauce onto their chicken. The chillies was a tad too salty as well. I was there to try out their porridge but it was already sold out when I got there at about 12.15pm.
Try chicken porridge. Delicious 
"Nice porridge. Ordered the pork one. Slightly too salty, but overall the porridge is very flavourful. Think they use some chicken stock for their porridge"
"Porridge had too much pepper for my liking and tasted a little bland overall.  Interesting that it's the same price with or without an egg included, and that they used salmon for the fish porridge."
"The taste is very nice. The price is so reasonable. A local place to try. The sellers are so friendly and fast. They sold pork Porridge, chicken porridge, chicken rice and fish porridge. We have option to eat here or take away. However, there is always the long queue here as it is the local favorite place."
Delicious classic chicken rice with a strong ginger flavour which I LOVE
"This stall is operated by an elderly couple serving pork, chicken or fish (Cantonese) porridge and selling chicken rice as well.  The porridge was served hot and nice.  The chicken meat was quite normal and the garlic chilli sauce was hot and I felt it had too much MSG in the sauce."
"price fair
Q too long"
Generous servings at affordable prices. There is always a queue.
I tried the porridge which is ok but not great. Chicken rice tastes better. The rice was fragrant and soft while other stalls tend to be harder. I prefer it soft.
very very dilicious soft rice soft chicken
"My family's favorite stall, we had been followed them for years. Very nice chicken rice and porridge. Worth trying."
Great place to have great porridge served with optional serving of poached chicken. The chicken meat is really tender. The generous drizzle of sesame oil based sauce brings pretty of flavour to the meat. Chilli sauce packs a decent amount of heat and citrusy refreshing taste. Price is also considered cheap for it's servin size and quality
"This place has a cult following. Many of us been following them since our kids were young.
The ultimate comfort food for the young and old.
The Chicken rice and porridge brings us back to the good old days where things in life were less stressful and simpler.
Just a simple plate of chicken rice and porridge will do."
Been patronising this porridge stall for at least 25years. They have shifted a few times over the years. The very first location when i patronized them was a coffeeshop in joo chiat along with fei fei wanton mee near the current kim choo ba zhang. The porridge from this stall has always been a comfort food for me. The minced pork is well marinated and the porridge was flavourful. Not much seasoning needed.
"Very reasonable prices. Shop used to be at Joo Chiat and closed for some time, but recently they moved to Dunman Food Centre. I love their pork porridge, and I like to order some Hainanese white chicken to go with the porridge. Comfort food at its best!"
"Ray,  thank for sharing.  Looking for them for months.  Will go eat today..."
They just opened back at Dunman hawker center. #02-13. But its self service now. Be prepared to stand in Q for it.
"Yummy!!  Chicken with Rice and pork porridge, good taste"
"The little quaint chicken rice/porridge stall is a hidden gem in the famous Eng Seng coffeeshop for it's pepper crab at night. This stall operates in the day and serves nice, tender and juicy ""white"" chicken, that goes really well with their porridge. Opt for the chicken meat serve separately with the porridge! Love the nostalgia feel and taste!"
One of the best chicken rice and porridge that I had ever tried. Better have it before the owners decide to retire. You won't regret.
Had the vegetarian laksa. It's big bowl and tasty. Not too oily. Noticed many customers during lunch. Good choice for vegetarian food.
"Very delicious laksa on Wednesday and Sunday
Aunty is very friendly"
"Ordered two bowls of laksa, delicious.
Aunty's service is , good service and affordable prices.
Wishing aunty and her family good health .

I took a picture of my laksa, could not be uploaded!"
First time came here..the dry mee pok tasted good and chewy. The owner are friendly although slow yet they have age so can understand
"Two servings for less than $8!! A great hideout vegetarian place, a 7 mins walk from civic Center."
"Sells affordable vegetarian food with vegan options. Food contains no alliums, hence suitable for religious vegans/ vegetarians.

I love their vegan/ vegetarian Mee Siam (with egg or without), do inform them if you do not want egg ( *available every Monday ). Their Mee Siam tastes almost the same as the Mee Siam I had in my primary school canteen, brings back wonderful childhood memories and comforts my soul with every sip of the Mee Siam gravy. Enjoy."
Tasty vegetarian food and value for money. And the best thing is that it is only just 10-15 min from Woodlands MRT. Will definitely visit more often.
Value for your money! Standard serving of a plate of beehoon with sides costs $2.50. Taste acceptable.
A packet of bee hoon mix only cost $2.50. However the bee hoon was tasteless.
Regular breakfast @ $2.20
"Your usual vegetarian stall, mixed vegetables rice style."
Good vegetarian stall within a kopitiam. Limited seating spaces in the morning.
"Stall is inside Fair View food court next to the carpark. Sad to say food is bland. No umami. Wife serves the food and husband is in charge of cooking. You will find a queue and it's because the lady is quite slow in serving. The side dishes and noodles, etc are served cold. Auntie is nice but food is not. If you're looking to fill your stomach and have no expectations, their food will do the job. Otherwise, look elsewhere for tasty vegetarian food."
"Was curious about the q at this stall when all the other stalls are empty. When it's my turn to buy,I realised the q was caused by the sloth-iness of the owner. Nothing much to talk about the food except it's edible."
"The otah.... the colour.... the taste ...

They will not have new dishes for lunch
Whatever dishes they have from morning will sell thru lunch"
"Good food, Good price!!"
"Great Vegeterian stall at north with rich experience and good culinary skill. Not fancy but you will spoilt with choices of their daily special. Sincere and generous owners always have customers at heart, foods not filled with over dose of MSG like many and you feel good after meal.. my favorite spot for late lunch whenever at north ( opens till about 4pm)"
Saturday mee robus was nice
One of my favourite coffeeshop vegetarian stalls that serves good vegetarian dried noodles. Prices are good and there are a variety of dishes to choose from except on the first and 15th of each lunar month which it is reduced.
Open only in the morning. Most items in the menu not available. They want you to buy what they want to sell. Quality of the prepared food is ok. But this is cheaper compared to others around
"Rojak sauce is ok, the you tiao and tow pok is a big hard and not crispy. (Think was bbq for quite sometime ago?)

Overall, just a normal Rojak. Not worth the price."
"Very bad attempt , waste of $ and calories"
"the mangkwang reeks. taste like salt water. horrible rojak, ew"
"Didn't get a chance to try the rojak at the newly revamped kopi tiam. I have had the dish before many times pre reno, and have never had any issues until today. They offer 4 types of rojak - signature, traditional, vegetarian and one more I think just  of youtiao & taupok. I picked the traditional and said 'no chili, cucumber, taupok, and if it comes with dried octopus, then no thanks'. I didn't say what to replace, I just know what I didn't want and left it to them (as I've always done before) to balance it out. Only to be told that any change of ingredient to the rojak is 40 cents per item. How does that math work? Removing a few pieces of taupok and maybe replacing it (at their discretion) with a few pieces of something else, warrants a change fee of 40 cents? Also I wasn't adding stuff for which there is an expected fee and would have happily paid. Of course I could pay the change 'fine' but it was the principle of demanding it that pissed me off!!! This is the first time I've encountered one for when ordering rojak let along, any food order!! I was no longer in the mood for my 2nd favourite rojak. I turned away, refusing to complete my order. I know the rentals in Parkway Kopitiam are high. But squeezing customers like this is NOT the way to run a business let alone get returning customers. I sense that for many, it will be a 'one and done' visit. Needless to say, I won't be returning. Lastly, I heard comments from my dad's friends about this new kopitiam - food is expensive and alas, not very good."
Doesn't even deserve one star in my very honest opinion. Rock hard yu char kway. So hard  you could do serious damage to your teeth! I returned the whole uneaten plate of horrible tasteless rojak. Be warned. NOT recommended.
The taupok and yu char kueh were so over grilled and hard.   Do not have the lime taste.   Not great.
The stall is selling authentic Thai food. The fried kway teow is good.
"The Mama Salad was a delightful dish--nicely cooked with a tangy, sour flavor. It featured three prawns and some sotong, with a slightly watery consistency that was still enjoyable. However, it lacked the desired spiciness despite a request for extra heat.

The Tom Yum Hot Pot, on the other hand, was a bit underwhelming. The sweetness and overpowering coconut flavor took away from the balance, earning it a 6/10. It's a dish you might want to skip.

That said, the Mama Salad alone is worth a return visit, and I'm excited to explore more dishes from the menu!"
Recommend Thai beef noodle its authentic 
I tried the Creamy Tom Yum Kway Teow and it is authentic and delicious. Friendly service and inexpensive prices. I recommend!
This 300mls soup cost 10$
"I am at a point where I can't believe google reviews any more or those ""hidden gem"" videos on TikTok but this store deserves all of their positive reviews. I literally saw someone post on an ig story about this place and decided to try it via grabfood today and ohhhh my god this is the best thai beef boat noodle I've had in SG. The stewed beef was so delicious the beef balls are boing boing bouncy, the soup omg the SOUP it's perfect amount of herbal taste and saltiness. So yummy. It also has some stewed radish that was so delicious. The basil chicken also was very good. This is MY hidden gem fr. Now I'm sad I'm moving out of Woodlands soon. I will be back to try in store soon."
"Probably the best Thai food in the woodlands area.
The beef noodles, tom yum mama basil pork are a must try, but most of their menus are great anyway, although I would avoid the fried pork belly and side dishes such as the fried spring roll."
"This should be the best, authentic Northern Thai food I've ever tasted in Singapore. All the flavours and ingredients are correct. Please open another outlet in the central area!"
"Excellent Thai food, it's restaurant quality(: The mango sticky rice had an authentic, perfectly balanced flavor with rich, creamy milk--one of the best I've had in sg, bringing back nostalgic memories. The mama noodle salad was very appetising. Plus, the lady boss was always smiling and very welcoming."
We tried the Tom Yum Mama and Beef Noodle soup. Both was great but the Tomyum Mama was amazing! It had just the right balance of creaminess and soureness. Might be one of the bedt tom yum mama i ever had
Finally some decent food in the North
"Super affordable and authentic restaurant-quality Thai food. My faves are the Bua Loy, Mango Sticky Rice, and Thai Laksa (a Northeastern Thai dish that is quite uncommon in Sg). Portions are generous. Highly recommend!"
"Wow!

Some of the best Thai food I've had in recent times! Basil Pork was fried to perfection, fish cake tasty and Tom Yam was just right, didn't feel like MSG overload...

Absolutely coming back to try other dishes.

Thank you friends and keep it up... So hard to find decent F&B these days at kopitiam prices. "
"Came here for the thai laksa, nam ngiao, and it was superb. The broth was delicious with it's smokey, meaty taste. The portion was large for $8 and the owner was really nice.

Highly recommended, would definitely come back again. Also they're running an opening promotion with 10% off."
"It is very rare to find an authentic thai laksa avaliable in sg. They only serve on every wed and fri. The thai beef noodle isaan style is very flavorful, and the beef is very tender. I highly recommend exploring this hidden gem to try both dishes."
The only authentic northern Thai laksa you can find in Singapore! travelled all the way from the east to have this comforting dish and it definitely didn't disappoint 
"I'm craving for bua loy. Did some research and came all the way here but in the end they don't have that dessert even though it was on their menu.

Nonetheless the pork noodle was really good, but I'm still upset I didn't get to eat bua loy dessert...."
Boss very friendly and nice
"First you will meet a Firdaus alike server which is a plus point!!

I recently visited Rudee's Thai Food and had an amazing experience! The moment I walked to the store, I was greeted by the warm, inviting service staff that felt both authentic.

The service was excellent--our server was friendly and attentive, making sure the food was good

Now, let's talk about the food! I ordered the Thai Laksa and the Tom Yum soup, and both dishes were absolutely delicious. The Thai Laksa was perfectly balanced with just the right amount of sweetness and tanginess, and the portion size was generous. The Tom Yum Soup was rich and creamy, with a delightful kick of heat that was just right for my taste.

The prices were quite reasonable, especially considering the quality and freshness of the ingredients.

Overall, I would highly recommend Rudee's Thai Food to anyone looking for authentic Thai cuisine. I can't wait to go back and try more dishes from their menu!"
"The menu offers an incredible variety of authentic Thai dishes, and everything we tried was absolutely delicious! Especially the TomYum soup

The portions were generous, and the presentation was beautiful. The service was prompt, attentive, and friendly, making us feel right at home.

If you're looking for a true taste of Thailand, this place is a must-visit! We will definitely be back to try more dishes. Highly recommended!"
One of the MOST authentic thai food I've had in SG. The tomyam soup is soooo comforting <3
super tasty! Great services as well! will definitely be back. One of the best Thai food
Authentic Thai taste in Singapore. 
"did not try any food here, but very limited choices"
"Ordered promotion set meal 38.00

"S11 Woodlands 630 Food Court is quite a typical heartland makan place--good variety, affordable prices, and decent food. I've been here a few times, and while there are some hits and misses, overall, it's a convenient spot if you're nearby and looking for something simple and filling.

The cai fan (economic rice) stall is one of the better ones here. Plenty of dishes to choose from, prices are reasonable, and portions are okay. Taste-wise, quite home-cooked style, not too oily, which I like. The chicken rice is not bad too, rice is fragrant, and the chicken is tender, but the chili could be stronger.

The zichar stall also depends on what you order--some dishes are quite good, but others can be quite average.

The place itself is spacious, but during peak hours, it can be hard to find a seat. Also, the tables sometimes take a while to be cleaned, so not the cleanest food court around. Ventilation also not great, so it can feel quite stuffy when it gets crowded.

Overall, S11 Woodlands 630 is a decent makan spot if you're in the area. Got variety, price okay, and some stalls are quite good. But I wouldn't say it's worth making a special trip just to eat here."
Good selection of food to choose from.
Chicken rice yummy
"Za Cai Fan Bu Wei Sheng,Yuan Gong Dai Zhao Chu Li Shi Wu De Shou Tao Shou Qian"
Reasonable quality and price of food.
Mostly empty stalls
"Oyster omelette is nice with wok hey, can eat again, chillie sauce dip also ok. Additional $2 for extra oyster (3 nos). As for the char kway teow, it is quite typical to me, not very tasty, hums are very small. Staff is nice, brought over the cooked food over to our table nearby even though it should be self service."
"The worst food ever.. Do not try the economic rice... Pathetic portion, expensive and not nice..."
"Try the Chicken rice - been having this for almost 18years ! Even I have moved further away from S-11, still coming back for it."
Went for a stall named Topping De Cuppies.. Tasty takoyaki.. With heartful filling..
This is my go to place whenever I'm around the area. I love the local delights fried bee Hoon. Generous portion and fried well with wok hey.
"Been eating here for more than 20 years
Chicken rice, econ bee hoon, roti prats all taste good.
But sadly majority of the stalls are leaving due to the hike in rental costs."
Malay food is good. Friendly staff
Love the stir fried Bee Hoon
"A normal coffee shop thats quite old .
No much food to eat and don't look very clean ."

"The newest zhichar store is horrendous, they do not sell crab and beef despite having those items on the menu. The rice is hard and the items are overpriced."
"Chicken rice (sesame oil) is great, char kway teow is packed with flavour as well."
A good variety of food and price is reasonable. The fried carrot cake is very nice. The Wanton Mee (Xiang Feng) is also very nice.
"This food center is like the neglected child of the S-11 group, with very little improvement seen over the last 20 years. Hygiene is passable at best.

The food is not bad at all, with Fish & Chicks, and Traditional Kway Teow Soup and a decent chicken rice stall being the strongholds. Prawn paste chicken from the economical rice stall is also commendable. Try their carrot cake; it has a nice sambal chili and portion size is generous."
Ya Zi Ji Fan Hen Hao Chi! Love the chicken rice stall
"Char kway tioa is quite good, worth trying."
Good food and not too crowded. The chicken rice is surprisingly good for $3.50.
"Dong Xi Du Hao Chi,Chao Guo Tiao,Chao Mi Fen,Cai Tou Guo Yi Liu"
"Tried out the chicken feet noodles. First off, it's huge. The noodles are spongy and springy which is great. The chicken feet, well only 2 huge pieces, were great."
Toilets are the WORST!!!
The coffee is nice. Curry puff by the Muslim stall us delicious
My go to coffee place !! Every morning 
It is a normal coffee shop with one muslin stall
New Zi Char stallXiang Gang Jie is excellent ! Dabao several times from them. Never disappoint. Looking forward to 5 or more to dine.  Try their Seafood mee goreng. 
chicken rice and hokkien mee there 
"Been eating here since young. Recently had their fried oyster (ordered through grabfood) and I have to say, if you're looking for local hawker food - look no further! If one is to compare the difference between the usual places (like east coast lagoon/chomp chomp food centre), the difference is not that much honestly, and the chilli that goes with it tastes amazing too!

definitely recommend it, oysters are also decently sized and juicy too!"
Decent food
"Neighbourhood coffee shop

Came here to meet friend. Ordered Zhir Char, got spicy Lala, fried pork, xo beehoon soup and sweet fried squid 

Got lucky, claimed 3 times 50 cents out of 4 bottles of Tiger. Not bad huh!"
"This is a neighborhood coffee shop. You should try the fried noodle, chicken rice and laksa. Nice."
A lot of varieties of food to choose from
Came here to eat Fish and Chicks. The area is super clean.
Watch out for the many birds here. They roam freely inside the coffee shop and perched themselves on the stacked chairs. Sometimes these scavengers would go into the stalls when the owners are busy or inattentive. Many smokers gather there too and they would even stand just beside the non smoking corner and smoke their lungs out. Many times the coffee shop supervisors have seen it but could not be bothered. My colleagues have also complained to NEA twice but nothing was done. Now for the food: the fried carrot cake! I love the white carrot cake and he does a pretty good job. Soft and fried just nice. Not exactly cheap as its a small portion for $3. He has lala vermicelli and char kway teow too. They are decent but the real winner is the fried carrot cake.
24 hrs food
One n only Malay Muslim stall is a must try mee goreng old skool!!! Power!!
Good food n service from the stalls.
Could be better ..keep it up !
"Good place for breakfast, limited selection though."
Clean eating place and less crowded here. Food decend good and less expensive compared to nearby store
I like char kway tyaw... Very nice and tasty. This is the most delicious Kway Tyaw in Singapore
There is a chicken rice stall. The best chicken rice i ever eat. And price is affordable. Top recommended.
The chicken rice is nice
Had been patronizing the chicken rice stall for over 22 years.
"Great pleas for variety of food  in 24Hrs especially for those craving for Hai Zhong Bao Zichar, Indian  Muslim prata & rojak, Japanese/Korean bento sets, Western meals, fish porridge/fish noodle/banmian, fried Hokkien noodles, fried fritters, popiah,  and Thai Mookata.etc.. 
"
"Other than chicken rice, muslim,fried kwayteow , carrot cake,fishball noodles and economical beehoon there should be stall selling local kueh like cheecheongfun and other kueh."
Good variety of stalls. Sufficient seats.
"- The go to place for nice serving of braised duck rice and noodle.
- The fried prawn noodle also a must try.
- Love also the Peri Peri western food ..  good portion but always have to queue ... suggest to order on-line and collect .
- With the added provision of the Thai Mokato service ... the makan place ventilation will be a minus point for me...."
nice western food
came here for prawn mee but its permanently closed! don't come here if u want prawn mee
Halal food not much choice
"If one has offended the supervisor in 1 way or another, she will tell the toilet cleaner to serve your drink."
"if in woodland area,it can be count POWER la"
"The food is nice,only $3.00 for fry Hokkien mee,is the cheapest food in Singapore,value for money,opening ia fr 11 am to 2p.m .The stall is manage by uncle 60 plus.Good food in Woodland cheapest.Can give a try,people stay in Woodland."
Average grade.
Huan Jing Man Qing Ji De. 
The Western food is delicious.
Very limited food choice. Tried the zhichar stall. Ordered black hokkien mee (M). Portion came like S.
The noodle stall food is fresh and quantity good.
"The food here generally better than I expected . Lao Shu fun is indeed very difficult to find at Singapore yet there is a stall selling it , hence I tried the Lao Shu fun . The food really taste great, with broth that is not too savoury . Hokkien mee for me is ok , as I have tasted better. For oyster omelette and char kway teow, they both taste fantastic, not oily and not salty. The food presentation is freaking neat and pleasant. I have patronised this stall 3 times !
Tze car for this sambal petai rice is not that nice, overpowering belacan taste."
Hai Xian Bai Mi Fen 
"S11,  after phase 2,  the seafood stall is managing their closure at their own discretion. If they tend to run their business at their own choice,  then S11 should step in and reinforce some rules and guidelines for proper service."
"Fang Bian,Sui Ran Xuan Ze Bu Hui Bi Shou Shi Zhong Xin Duo
Dan Duo Shu Da Zhong Hui Chi De Du You"
Near to my house.Not so crowded.Praticing good distancing.Stall holders good hygiene.
Agree that the coffee charge is a bit high. $1.2 for a small cup of coffee in neighborhood coffee shop.
"I'm regular patron of newly open fish ball noodle, the taste ok but today 3 small stone hidden in the vege ans almost crack my tooth when I chewing, not much food varieties  can found in this restaurant

The coffee, chicken rice, bihun soto, is good"
"Limited choice and the drinks store overcharged me for $4 breakfast set, other stores charged around $3."
"Coffee shop with Mixed vegetables rice, chicken rice, ban mian, Western, Zhu chao. All of them are fairly cheap $4-$6 except for western, $9-$15"
"too many heavy smoker, they are very inconsiderate, smoking at non-smoking area.. very bad air ventilation,"
KNs Indian Muslim food has amazing egg paratha with different curries for really reasonable price. Mini food court with lots of food options.
Hokkien mee is a must-try.
"Delicious food there! Foods over there like chicken rice, carrot cakes, etc are extremely tasteful as the people there have been working for a long time and are very experience in delivering nice food."
The place is nice and quiet and the food also not bad too
Sucks. food overcook
Convienient is the key point of this coffeeshop.
"(Morning & Afternoon): 1 mixed rice, 1 Char Kuey Teow, 1 local noodle shop, 1 Korean food stall, 1 economy noodle, 1 chicken rice & 1 prata + Malay food stall.

Drinks served all day long. Alcohol is only served in the night."
Some variety of ok food at reasonable price. Yong tau foo was economical and nice.
Oh yes ok la.
My usual order is either economy fried flat noodle or fried carrot cake.
the birds are scavenging among the unattended plates on nearby tables after the customers have left.
"An Jing,Hao Qu Chu. Ka Pei Bu Cuo. "
Great place for daily meal for resident or worker near by this block. can try some new food after getting tired of same old food at same location.
The food is ok
Nice Muslim food stole
Standard coffee shop fare but nothing spectacular.
Simple coffee shop with local delicacies
Lousy service
Can be improve especially the attitude of economic noodle stall Auntie!

"Like the ""Duckling"" chicken rice most.."
Not much choice of food
"Spacious walkway and well ventilated eating area. I ate Hokkien mee, upsized to $4. I received 3 big whole delicious prawn on it with the expected quantity. The moist texture is just right with wondeful taste. Like it a lot!"

Lousy service at drinks counter. Just ask a simple question but the answer like i owe het 1million dollars.
Functional
The fishball noodles and prwan noodles there is very nice
Hen Fang Bian Ba Shi Zhan Jin Xue Zhi Zhu Zhai mRT
Nothing to eat
Awesome Carrot Cake!
Very good tasty seafood! Must try!
"Used to like the Malay stall food especially the prata and lontong. Not going to visit it ever again (Will advise my friends and family too) after an extremely negative experience with the prata uncle. It started with a small misscommunication
on the number of prata ordered. This is fine, I understand they are busy so I clarified again. But he then ACCUSSED ME that I changed my mind in a very sarcastic face and tone. This totally spoilt my day. Did not argue further as I do not want to appear on Stomp.

Not bad food but lousy service. I will see how long it last. Sadly many think that kopitiam no need to care about quality of services.

The fried carrot cake stall is not bad.

Coffee and tea from drink stall are okay but auntie has got super black face as if you owed her a million dollar."
Typical no-frill Singapore coffee shop
"Neighborhood food, convenient."
Malay food roti prata good
Bad coffee attendance
Chicken rice good
Nice place to eat :)
Loved the facilities at this library! Especially the youth facilities on the fourth floor!
The roti canai here is usually nice.
Limited food stalls
There is a seafood zi char stall which food is not bad
The chicken rice stall is very good!
Open 24/7. When I came back home after work. This place is where I dine
Caters for the neighborhoods needs. Reasonably priced food.
No good food.many empty stall.
Chicken rice is nice
quick meal only... nothing fantastic!
Not easily accessible
Like the chicken rice a lot of meat.
Food is average for the fishball noodles at $3. Tea is also so so. The mixed veg stall seems popular during lunch time.
"Average neighbourhood coffee shop. Stay away from the zhi char stall, frequently mixes up orders and with no proper queue system. The rest of the food stalls are average, no stalls that stand out."
"Quite place, nice Teh , options are limited tho"
Sambal fried rice $4.50 from the zi char stall. Fried rice isnt flavourful enough. Smth is lacking. The rice grains are not dry enough as there are some rice lumps together. Might not buy sambal fried rice from them again.
"Normal local food available, Prawn Noodles , Chicken Rice and Seafood Stalls are not bad"
Bee Hoon stall in the morning - best food for years already. Longest queue of all stalls in the morning.
Smokers everywhere and the workers are not helping to get smokers to sit at designated smoking area. Not suitable for family with kids.
Very nice d roti prata malay guy making named Mr Fandi. But they normally close on Monday(off day )
Quiet neighbourhood
"I always frequent the previous Malaysia boleh banmian store.. since it changed to SG hawker, tastes so different.. the soup used to be thick and flavourful, now it's like salt and water, also so giamsiap inside everything floating around cos it's so sparse in ingredients.. It's quite surprising how the banner and even everything looks the same but tastes so different, a far cry from what it used to be. :/
Also, last time they used to issue the buzzer even for takeaways, now so messy and disorganized.. plus, the serving counter so high for scalding hot soupy stuff, so dangerous. Accident waiting to happen.
Won't be patronizing this banmian store anymore, will go to katong shopping ctr instead.

Edit** ok, I Fan Jian, say don't wanna buy from here already but craving for handmade mee hoon kueh again.. this time, the taste is back! It's yummy again.. guess I was just suay the other time and was served by a ""stand in"" or bad cook."
$7 ridiculous pricing
"A note to the store's manager (store name: way of soup - selling soup steamed fish)  - the staff are dishonest, rude and careless in handling transactions at this stall. I ordered 2 dishes, they made 1 and charged me the wrong amount 

After I told them about it, they dismissed the issue and rudely told me ""how would they know?"" about the being overcharged. Totally unacceptable given they overcharged me and I had clearly paid already based on my credit card transaction. They even used another customers receipt to show me that I was wrong...

Secondly, giving me the wrong order amount and allowing me to walk away with less than what I asked for is absolutely ridiculous  please do something about the 2 men working there who continuously defended themselves until they found out I was right when the correct receipt was lying on the counter, proving my transaction was indeed overcharged."
"The steam fish dish here is so good. This has become my Sunday go-to lunch store.

The young staff was wearing an earpiece facing the back at work last week,  the boss came and monitored this week, and service delivery has improved.  Hope the guy keeps his job and improving from now on."
I'm pleasantly surprised with the quality of soup at WAY OF SOUP. I had the water Cress soup. It felt like what my Cantonese mother-in-law would cook. Slow boiled for hours. Even the water cress was soft and the soup flavoursome!  Pity I forgot to take photos!!! I'm coming back to get the other soup again!
"This Malaysia Boleh tak boleh make it...the CKT and claypot chicken rice were both average.

EDIT 11/5/25: Malaysia Boleh has now changed hands and is called SG Hawker. Ordered CKT and claypot chicken rice again via delivery and have to say it was actually pretty decent! Fairly big portion as well but CKT had a grand total of 2 prawns :("
$7 for 3pc of sliced fish. Ridiculous. Never buying this again.
"I12 SG Hawker Management! Pls take note, your staff very rude!!!!

I came here twice, I remember this uncle, he got attitude problem, very fierce to customer, black face. First time I came here, his attitude.
2nd time came here, even worse.
Ask him give receipt, he didn't give.
Because of him, spoil my mood in the early morning."
Mostly Chinese food
"places was small and have limited choices with barely anything to choose from, used to sell more food in the past. Won't come back again"
Had Saba rice set for $6.50. Delicious & reasonable price. The ice lemon tea is overpriced at $3.00 each. Even iced lime water (two cut limes and ice water only) also costs $3.00.
2 stars overall because of their astronomical prices for mediocre food!
"The price point is ok, as you can get better food and cheaper prices at the Marine Parade food centre approximately seven minutes walk away.

The bak kut teh was ok. Nothing fantastic.

2.20 White coffee was actually 3 in 1 powdered coffee. Though they use a blender, it is what it is."
"One of The worst food courts in Singapore! Crazy expensive prices and very very poor hygiene!! The taste of the food here have gone horribly wrong!!! This kind of food places totally ruins the nation reputation. New management took over this hawker and drove the standard down the drain. If you want up the prices, you should at least maintain your standard of food production and hygiene. Please do some justice to our local food culture!!!!"
"ordered kimchi fried rice from korean japanese fusion store, literally inedible. too salty and oily"
Not a good place to find something to eat there nowadays since it was taken over and revamped. Petty

I had the char siew wanton noodles and the durian ice kachang. The char siew had equal layers of fats and meats and it was charred perfectly at the edges. It will be better to add the green chilli as well as the red chilli (for the rice) to add more flavour to the noodles. The durian ice kacang tasted great too.
Mind blowingly bad service from the mee hoon kuey stall. Waited 15 mins and he didnt even start cooking. Was extremely unapologetic and rude too.
I have yet to come across char kway teow that cannot fried without chilli...
"Have not been to i12 for quite a while. Decided to check it out and have lunch there. Going up the basement escalator, you will see SG Hawker food court. Went in got a nice clean table, lined up for the Chup Chye Png (which was affordable @$4.50 and nice). Had to try the Ipoh white coffee that was advertised there. It was nice and only for $2.20. The Auntie and Uncle cleaners there were also friendly and kept the place clean and tidy. Not a big place, but I will come by again when I am in the area. Full support for this establishment."
"Poor hygiene standards and food quality. Especially the claypot chicken/sesame chicken store. Inefficient and rude, making people wait 10minutes just to order. Worst still, witnessed the claypot being washed and returned to the stall with excess dirty water. Instead of removing, the cook for the stall simply placed it on the stove and added ingredients in again for the next lucky customer who is going to enjoy a disgusting meal with dish washing water as a add on ingredient"
"Had the fish sauerkraut and dry mala bowl at the mala stall. The amount of fish is generous enough and they use sea bass.
The mala was good too. It's quite spicy for me even though it's supposed to be slightly spicy level.
Had it a second time after that and chose the ingredients to go along with the pickled veg soup slightly spicy. The spicyness was moderate. People who can't take spice would not be ok with it. But it was well cooked and presented. The baby corn I chose was first fried and charred first before putting into the soup and this made it so yummy! Would highly recommend choosing baby corn as one of the ingredients. The effort that the chef put in, to not just simply cook in soup was amazing. Would definitely go back. In fact, already craving now.
Note: they charged an additional $2 for me not hitting $20. I didn't see it the first time I had it. Good to check with counter staff to verify this."
We r very grateful to the cleaner & staff of sg hawker. As we left our bag there 3 days ago. It still can be found. And not a single cents was lost. Great job that they have done. A big kudo to them

Food that I ordered is not good. I ordered from the rojak store and the scrambled egg rice store. Service and environment is also not ideal. First time here and will not come back.
"Tables not so clean, char kuay tiao taste weird and sour. The ban bian store ppl blur and rude."
"Wah this place. Hygiene is a BIG ISSUE !!
flies are everywhere.
Plates and tray return area is packed
Air-con leaking
Funky smell after the cleaner clean the tables
The supposedly clean chopsticks and spoons are so filthy like never washed. Still can see food scrap.

Wah please don't go. I am stunned"
"Really good varied choices of good food here! Especially the Lien MaMa (very authentic Taiwan Dessert! Better than most branded Taiwan desserts out there) and Cai Fun and Fish soup here is good, a pity though as the hawker constantly smells like sewage and toilet water.. please fix the scent of this place! Thank you!"
Food was very nice. Price wise abit higher than usual food court. But still worth to go.
Kind of hot in the food court except table near the entrance where getting nice cooling aircon from the mall
"the staffs manning the BKT stalls need to up their service. stood there for a good ten minutes , and still not taking orders, despite there is a q behind me. too busy with packing food and totally ignored customers. asked him if this is the where i place my order. and he replied (wait) in an impatient manner. so glad that i walked away after i read some similiar experience reviews from others here."
Mei You Yi Yang Hao Chi Hen Shi Wang
"Food here is great
Claypot rice worth the price of $6. Fantastic"
"Avoid WenKangJi (wanton mee stall)when eating at SG Hawker i12. The standard have dropped drastically. Char siew is hard and dry, rice is undercooked. To top it off, the chilli for the wanton mee was sour. Having patronised the stall since it was at joo chiat till now, this was the first time we had sour chilli. And informed the staff at the stall. They dismissed and said its fine."
"Overall the revamp to SG hawker is a positive one, the environment is nice for a food court, although the stalls can be a hit and miss.

5 stars for the following food: the chendol is exceptionally good, dan lao's scrambled egg rice bowls and wen kang ji's wanton noodles are very good as well.

But avoid the ban mian stall (very bad quality, one time we had the ban mian and the meat we was obviously rotten and inedible) and the Malaysian food stall (mediocre quality across all the dishes we tried from this stall)."
"Wet ban mian and ee mian were great. Broth is very tasty.

Stuff is very pricey these days in 2024. But even at 5 dollars the bowl of ee mian is crazy worth it.

Meat slices were thick and chunky. Noodles had spring.

On the other hand the bak ku teh store is mega not worth it. It's not even a single full pork rib. But a pork rib slash into 3 parts. Forget 2 pork ribs. You barely get one. I'm willing to pay more for meat. I wasn't expecting mini bits of meat"
Got a great variety of food to choose from.
Food so so.
"New stall wanton noodles that took over the prawn noodle. Thought it will be better. But it was much worse! No dark sauce. No  black char siew sauce. The Chilli is also another joke! 1st time ate a total white wan tan noodles. The wantan has a stale smell also. Wonder kept for how long. Only saving grace is the fatty char siew. Oh last but not least, is the soup. Even chicken cubes soup taste better"
This cost me $13.50 for double fish soup. I actually added fish and hence cost $13.50. Is this the right amount or they prob forgot to add fish for me. Im curious
"The atmosphere of this 'food court' is vibrant. Unfortunately the food is terrible. My family and I ordered food from the Mee Hoon Kueh shop, and 3 of us had different types of noodles. In the end, all 3 of us can't finish our food as it was terrible. However we also ordered Char Kuay Teow from the Jalan Alor stall and it was good . We missed the Penang prawn noodle which used to operate there."
"The staff of Jalan Alor Food Stall KL Bak kut teh was not interested and condescending. The food was average but the service puts u off immediately.
The rest I have tried, Wen Kang Ji wanton noodle is good, fish soup is good. 4-5 star.

KL Bak Kut teh need to review their service mindset."
"UPDATE 2024: To my horror, I found out that Malaysia Boleh has become SG Hawker and changed some of the stalls, like the wantan mee one which was pretty good the last time we tried. There is another wantan mee stall in its place and unfortunately this version of noodles is bland and devoid of flavour - priced higher at $7.80 too but there was quite a lot of charsiu which had good texture.

The mee hoon kueh from another stall tasted average at best but left us super thirsty immediately after. One bowl had lots of egg, another bowl didn't have any at all. Overall a disappointing lunch and I'll have to try other stalls before revising this rating.

Review from 2023:
Clean, spacious and well-ventilated food court in the basement of i12 Katong. Wasn't crowded on a Saturday long weekend lunch. Only tried 2 stalls:

1. The charsiu noodles with wonton soup ($5.50) exceeded expectations - wiry noodles coated in a thick, dark sauce with a delicious hint of pork lard flavour. Tasted pretty similar to KL versions to me.
2. The char kuay teow ($5 for small) failed to hit the mark. Just no. Should be fluffier with more egg, not so wet and with fresher bean sprouts.

That said, I find complaints about the prices here unfair - this is an air-conditioned food court in an upscale neighbourhood's community mall, not an open air HDB food centre. Portions and prices for what I tried were justified to me."
"Ban mian promo set - noodle under cooked so abit hard & stick together as shown, taste good, crispy thin ikan bilis, gyoza also crispy but a tab salty. Service is normal - no smile/thank you but not rude. Tables are not wiped. Aircon is not strong enough so if eat something hot/warm might feel hot."
You can't get good food in this place. The food was cold. It tasted not good. It was very cheep.
"Wanted to order the Char Siew Fried Rice, but cashier said it wasn't available but char siew wanton noodles were available instead. Apparently they ""cannot spare char siew for fried rice""?

The store was doing a lot of take out orders so customers ordering in person are second fiddle - waited a good 25 minutes for food that was barely warm."
"Waited 20 minutes for the char siew wanton mee. It tasted fine, food wasn't hot though. It didn't that look busy, food was definitely not worth the wait."
Tried a few stalls here. Hits and misses depending which dish you order. Decided to give 2 instead of 3 stars thanks to the unprovoked poor attitude of the lady at the popiah stall.
Mee Hoon kuey Dry  Must Try it
Ordered ice lychee but the taste was diluted and tasteless . Asked if can add sugar or change drink but the uncle just poured sugar into the cold water without bothering . Don't recommend !
Saw a new ban mian stall and wanted to try. But it is disappointing. I thought the meat was uncooked since is so red. So we kindly bring it back to request to cook longer. Turn out that the meat is of lousy quality. The stall responded that the meat is like that. I cook longer also same. So I guess we will not try this stall again.
"My folks had dinner here on Saturday night. My dad started throwing up and diahorrea the same night. He is now at the hospital.

He had the Chendol (which we suspect is the culprit) and the Prawn Mee. Will NEVER come back and do not recommend for anyone to patronise. Food poisoning is no small matter and can be fatal. Don't risk it."
"All these caifan dishes for 15+, value for money and everything tastes good!"
"best ban mian ever. was what made me come to appreciate and like ban mian because of how chewy and bouncy the noodles are, how savoury, comforting and addicting the soup is, with a generous amount of minced and sliced meat, braised mushrooms, vegetables and ikan bilis. pretty affordable for $5 pls come try"
"waited 25 minutes for fried rice, pork cutlet came sour and spoiled. staff's attitude at chicken pot stall is poor."
"Rou Gu Cha Tan Wei Yuan Gong Fu Wu Tai Du Hen Chai,Yu Qi Hen Bu Hao,Hen lcly"
Decor very nice but food selections not great. No KL yellow thick black Hokkien mee. Had the hot fun which was average. Rojak was ok. Penang fried kway teow so so. Not coming back.
The only bak kut teh in singapore and malaysia that charges $2 to top up soup. Claypot is over cook and cause the soup to have burnt smell. Meat is hard. Definitely not bak kut.

Such bad service/attitude that I will never come back again. Order was taken wrongly by the stall and yet they didnt want to change a new order for us.

"wanted to order KL char siew mee (wanton noodle), staff said sold out. am shocked, its only 10am sold out. then he said no char siew.

duno want do business or what. dont turn on the light if nt ready would be appropriate.

ordered chicken rice n fried kway teow instead."
"Rou Gu Cha Hao Chi
Ke Xi Zuo Wei Shang Fang De Leng Qi Hui Di Shui"
Agreed that the fried away tiao stall attitude is bad. Standard order with chilli & bean sprouts.
"Yi Bao Bai Ka Pei Nan He Dao Xiang Tu,Zhuo Zi Xu Yao Zi Ji Mo"
"Katong I12 basement food court
The Malaysia Boleh! Ice Chendol is a delightful treat that offers a unique twist on the traditional chendol dessert.  the overall experience, giving it that authentic Malaysian touch."
"The two noodle places at the entrance are still great. Add extra fish and egg to the one to the left.

How quickly a food court can go downhill. The wonton mee quality is totally random. Sometimes pretty good and at other times bad. The popiah was bad from the beginning. The claypot is just average. The soup with torn pieces of noodle dough is still pretty good. The other soup place by the entrance is good.

2023
Mixed but many good stalls"
"So rude service and staff. After half a year, still have the same bad face and bad staff."
"All in all, this is a good place to sample Malaysian Food. We recently visited it, and we had:

- Prawn Bee Hoon Noodle Soup (absolutely delish!) $6
- Sesame Oil Chicken with rice $6 (yummy. Chicken pieces too few)
- Rojak (small plate $4.20. Taste was ordinary & portions very small)

It's the only ""food court"" in I12 Mall."
Aircon really cold but dessert is great. Love the gula melaka in their chendol and ice kachang. Soursop tastes amazing. Affordable and reasonable price given the thickness and authenticity of the syrup and delicious kidney beans. Very clean sink area to wash hands also.
"Love the Chilli ban mee (spicy!), Charsiew Wanton Mee, Carrot Cake and Fried Kway Teow. Nice atmosphere and prices are a little high but I imagine it is to justify the rent at I12 thus it's acceptable. Only downside is most of the hawkers are often grumpy or rude."
"Ice kacang is not bad, a little too sweet though."
Food is subpar. But the service is worse. Bespectacled young guy at the Penang kway stall rudely threw the buzzer on the tray after payment and I observed he was also rude to other customers. I don't know whether I'm getting free food or you are not paying your staff but the staff attitude is terrible. Won't come back.
"Roasted chicken rice was served skinless and with more taugeh than rice. My mum had a baby cockroach served on top of her claypot sesame chicken rice. Thankfully, she spotted it before digging in. Disgusting."
4 small slices of fish from fish soup stall costing $8
"TLDR: this outlet sucks.

7 Feb 24 visit

Overall the staffs' attitude is super bad. Like owe them a lot of $$. From the drink stall to kway teow and claypot stall.

Still cannot comprehend why kway teow must be chillie only. When ask the guy said because the ingredients comes with chili. I guess they are just lazy to cook with and with out chilli.

Previous visit

The Char Kway Teow only had spicy version. Was told by the cook there is no black non spicy. Such a shame. The Lap Cheong is so thin.

The Char Siew Mee on the other hand was fantastic. The pork lard mixture was very original style. Some of the noodle not cooked properly."
"Dey, this chicken rice stall got freaking feather man next time clean the chicken properly plz"
Hello where is the fish???? $6.50 for 2 small piece of fish and fish bits??? Sibei rabak. Cashier also act like customer owe him 1 million?? Maybe just go back malaysia?!?!?
Claypot chicken rice here is good! Especially on a rainy day 
"Rou Gu Cha Tan Wei De Yi Wei Nian Qing Ti Xing Shou Xiao De Yuan Gong
Fu Wu Tai Du Ji Chai  Yu Qi Bu Hao"
"The claypot chicken is nice, but the char kuey tiao is a disappointment.."
I seldom want to comment on F&B because doing F&B business is very tough but this Rojak really can't make it...the youtiao is hard as a stone...not recommend to eat
"Prawn noodles, they use frozen prawns instead of fresh ones! Thumbs down! Even hawker centre use fresh ones. Is the stall trying to cut cost or lazy to prepare fresh ones?"
"Located in the basement of i12 Katong Mall, not far from the escalator, this food court offers a variety of Malaysian dishes. Enjoy options like Ipoh coffee and chendol, popiah or rojak. The well-designed seating plan makes it a pleasant place to dine, chill, or grab a cup of coffee. Cashless payments via payWave are accepted."
Very very poor service
"Food was okay but not the best, not many option as well. It's quite easy to find a table but it is self-service. Most payment are with cards."
"First time being served with skinless chicken, very shock when I see it. A lot of rice with minimal chicken. Won't buy again."
Had the worst orh luak of my life here - it was 90% starch.
"It's a basic food court styled to provide Malaysian hawker food.

Tried the herbal bak kut teh and did not enjoy it.
No cilantro or lettuce to add some greens to the soup. (As shown in the pictures on the menu).
The soup also tastes like it's missing some herbs - star annice, wolf berries, etc.

I can't put a finger on it.. but I would pass on this the next time."
Food here is ok. I come here almost every weekend because of convenience. But the staff tending to the stalls are mostly very rude. Makes you feel like you are eating for free. So be ready for that.
"Nan Chi,Mai Chi De Fu Wu Yuan Pi Qi Pi,Fu Wu Chai,Fu Wu La Ji! Bu Hui Zai Qu Chi Liao!"
The wok hei and charred feel was up to standard! Not bad can try!
"supposed to be a pet free foodcourt.  however saw pet dog fed using same common utensils at this foodcourt.  disappointing when there is no staff, supervisor, manager doing anything when I tried to inform them."
drinks stall too slow..my other food was ready way before the queue got to me
"Only eat here if you started your day happy and wanted to change that.
Kaya toast set - toast comes uncut so try eating that without getting butter and Kaya all over your face. Condiments for the half boiled eggs have their dispenser holes plugged up so you'll be enjoying your eggs unflavored.
And the service... had to think back if I'd drove over and killed the cashiers dog while driving in since she sure acted that way."
"Very rude food preparation by stuff of Huang Chao noodle. I requested for less spicy. Male staff not happy, show tantrums, throwing bowls with loud sound. This is not the first time. The staff do not seem happy serving. Probably they didn't realise this is Singapore and not Malaysia."
Rude uncle at the hokkien mee stall. Don't bother to tell nicely where to order and where to collect the order. Just scolded me when I ordered and quietly gave me a death stare from the corner I had to collect my order from. Expect me to know that is where I have to collect from. Haha.   like I owe him anything lol. Crazy
Lots of famous and authentic Malaysian food to be found here. Affordable and nice ambience.
"The staff manning the cashier / taking counter is very rude.

I have been there twice and both times unpleasant experience.  When I talked to them they don't respond and glares rudely

Terrible service, rude"
"21 September 2023 - Horrible experience with the rude staff (washing the vegetables) at the minced pork noodles stall in the morning.

My elderly mother had asked him what time will the stall be opened and he just yelled back angrily, ""Can't You See That I'm Washing The Vegetables!!!?!!!"".

This sudden and terrible outburst by the staff had placed her in a bad mood the whole day and would definitely deter my family from patronising Malaysia Boleh Katong i12 again.

Staff definitely needs to be disciplined as he is using his hands and not his mouth to wash the vegetables right? Just a simple reply would be sufficient, don't have to vent his anger on customers, especially elderly people!"
Popiah was tasteless  - at 2.70 per piece -
"Just a feedback, Sunday lunch at 12pm sold out all fish soup, signature dish, left with noodle?Everybody in the long Q complain not informed because they wait so long.

Oyster egg small plate come with 2 oyster only. 

Food is still good, but seriously."
The Penang Laksa here is far from authentic.
Nice Ipoh white coffee
Food stalls serve pretty good quality food. Ambience was good as it wasn't too crowded. Orh Jian and fish soup was good.
"We come here because it's convenient when staying at the hotels nearby. The food is pretty good but more expensive than other hawker centers. Each dish is about $5.50. The hours state closing is at 10:00 pm but don't come after 8:00 pm because the vendors are cleaning, grumpy, or out of food. Visa cards are accepted here."
"Lor mee horrible taste! Please avoid!
Char Kway Teow is acceptable!
Hokkien Mee (Chilli Mee) very small portion.
Bak kut Teh stall so far best taste.
Chendol and Ice-kacang cute portion.
Rest of food haven't tried.
The place quite noisy from some air vent."
Do not order the youtiao rojak! 6.20 for a small portion and every single piece is rock hard and crunchy. Easily the worst rojak I've eaten in my whole life.
"Most of the foods were great when they first opened. But the standard has since dropped. Eg chendol, was pretty good last time, but now, the light green strips of chendol are almost transparent (look at attached image) and absolutely TASTELESS. Ice shavings are rough (when they used to be fine shavings)

Highly recommend Nyonya Chendol at old airport road instead, the green chendol is bursting with coconut  flavour!"
"Teocheow Noodle House has major hygiene and order placement issues.

Tomyum fish soup becomes, fishball soup with a dead housefly and weird stuff.

Hope the authorities look into their hygiene management, with workers without proper hygiene protection while handling food such as mask and gloves."
"Standard compared to other branch seems a bit weak. Short of staff , 1 staff has to mend 2 Station. Ice kancang store nobody mending had to stand there until people come  .. tray return area full of tray and no place to put my tray when returned. Tables stained and sticky"
"New noodles stall at i12 foodcourt. 1st stall at the entrance on the left sells teochew noodles and fish soup. Fish soup was average tasting and soup was not piping hot, ee fu noodles al dente (3/4 cooked). Sliced fish quite thinly sliced. Need to request to separate fried fish if you prefer it cripsy and not soggy.

Their speciality is teochew noodles and not fish soup I supposed."
"Malaysia Boleh offers a delightful array of authentic Malaysian dishes that transport your taste buds to the vibrant streets of Malaysia. From mouthwatering chicken rice to aromatic bak kut teh, this restaurant truly captures the essence of Malaysian cuisine."
Absolute rip-off. The prawn mee soup has one miserable shrimp in it and padded with just noodles. $6 a bowl. Won't be going back there again.
Sesame oil chicken's portion is very little.
"Paid $4.5 for this. No vegetables, ingredients were also little, soup very plain compared to other outlets. Disappointed! Felt cheated."
"Easy choice to dine here, everyone can get their own Malaysian food fix. Standards improved since they opened. Will be back."
the food stil ok
"Very misleading menu prices for the carrot cake stall. Tried to order a small black carrot cake, $4, which was clearly on the menu. But the stall owner blatantly lied and said that the $4 only applies to white carrot cake. If this was a mistake on the menu, they should change it. If not, they should not even have a $4 option on it. For black carrot cake."
Nice food court with decent food and price around this area
"Nice concept but quality hardly Malaysian standard. The chendol in particular consist of half the usual amount of coconut milk, so basically you have iced gula Melaka. Even when issue raised they will tell you ""put oledi"".all in the name of saving a few cents."
"TL;DR - Chilli Ban Mian was disappointing for me; the Assam Laksa was not bad. Lots of noodle options and not so much so for rice.

My experience is specific to the Chilli Ban Mian and the Assam Laksa. Sadly, I did not enjoy the Chilli Ban Mian. The noodles were so chewy that I decided not to finish them, which is rare for someone like me who hates to leave food unfinished. The soft boiled (?) egg, minced meat and ikan bilis ended up paste like, somehow, so I didn't enjoy the texture. Not doing a good job describing it, but it just didn't work for me... so it was kinda disappointing especially after waiting 15 minutes for my buzzer to ring.

My companion did enjoy her Assam Laksa, and I tried some too. Pretty good that one. Speaking of noodles, this place is good for noodle lovers. Most of the carb options are that... Kway teow, curry chicken noodles, char siew noodles, etc.  If you prefer rice, I think you just have two options - chicken rice and claypot chicken.

The place itself is much bigger than it looks from the outside, with ample seating even during Sunday lunchtime. There are sinks with soap here and there so that was convenient too. Payment methods include cash, Shopee Pay and PayWave. Remember to help out by returning your tray!"
Oh Luak was a bit oily and salty. Popiah was good. Prawn noodles was decent.
"Hope this place Closed Down AsAp !Worse place to eat .Food are not too  nice , not cheap nevermind but the guy in charge there is like  Malaysian ah beng . I was there to tapao my food for my wife and was holding my sandwich while waiting for her to msg me wat she wanted . I took a bite of my sandwich and was kena scolded for eating at the their place . Never to come back . Super rude to customer . I hope Food republic take over n have better variety of local food ."
Fried char kway teow 
"Came down on a weekend for a late lunch, but it was already post lunch hour. So found quite a few tables empty. Decent number of seating tables considering it's in a mall basement. But can't say about the rush during peak hours.

Ordered the char kway Teo, and it was freshly made. Flavours could be more robust, but the bean sprouts, prawns etc were fresh. It was piping hot, fresh off the wok and it was satisfying. The accompanying sambal was good too. Also tried the roti prata teh combo and it was good value for money. Even that was freshly made so spot on.

Yet to try other stalls, will be back again."
Not as good as expected. No customer touch. MSG overdosed.
"Service terrible, especially cleaners."
"Let the crowd and previous reviews speak for themselves. 130pm on a sat, place is only half full. Chewy Char Siew meat with noodles. Tastless and watery Hokkien Prawn noddles. Wet Claypot chicken rice. Weak cup of milk tea. Only saving grace was the rojak."
Decent food
The chendol at $2.50 is pathetic with the single young woman server taking care of 2 stalls being over stretched.
"The Penang Prawn noodle is good, but should have added in Water spinach"
"Sounds like this is a baby free outlet which my first time to experience in Singapore because we were shouted to stop feeding our 2ys old with carried baby food instead of food bought inside. Be careful of the guy wear in black stay around ""Ya Cai Fan"".
We usually buy drinks and feed child first, then order food after feeding. And have been more than one year no any bad experience.  Not sure they changed rule or not from today, but this is what happened.  Should be the only one in Singapore don't allow child feeding. :( Too bad and left right away."
"Decent CKT with enough wok hei

Trick is to come down during off peak period for the nice char wok tastes. The chefs are not hurried and take their time to fry !"
"Wei Dao Ke Yi,Bu Guo Tai Man Liao,Gan Shi Jian De Bu Jian Yi"
"Like this food court, miss Malaysian taste sometimes and as good as it gets.
Tried the kway teow store and not bad. Will be back to try others!"
"Rude and no proper English. I think it is mainly Chinese stalls with pork, no clue why it is called Malaysia Boleh..."
"If you are looking for affordable local food in a nice air conditioned building, you can try Katong i12's Malaysia Boleh foodcourt.

The decor is slightly different from the usual foodcourts and has a good amount of seating. We were there on a weekday morning so there wasn't a problem finding a seat for three.

I tried the Claypot Sesame Chicken with rice (add-on) and it was not bad. It was prepared rather quickly too. It has a good amount of sesame and ginger flavour in the sauce."
"UPDATE:
Their prawn noodles can't make it. Prawn like baby shrimps.

Avoided this food court for a while as it's opening phase so crowded, popiah was horribly made at that time and no reception for StarHub 4/5G.

They seemed to have improved! Pretty good place when you visit them non peak. Lots of selection. Typical food court prices $5-10. I've just reviewed the Ah Piao Kway Teow Soup in their page. It's excellent. Will try the chendol, prawn noodle, assam laksa, etc progressively."
"Ordered chicken rice.  Takeaway in a plain paper box had to top up 65 cents each.  Also no chilli included for takeaway.  Chicken tasteless.  Rice was tasty but full of MSG.

2nd round, Ordered chicken rice for eat in and one of us gets free soup and one doesn't.  Inconsistent service.

And I think I got tricked by the takeaway price.  Should have asked for receipt.

Not worth the calories.  Chicken skin and bones and 3 slices of cucumber."
Hawker fare
"A few stalls not open. Food from available stalls was mediocre. Hawkers were arrogant and unfriendly. Char kway teow must be with chili. If u can't take chili, too bad, eat something else. Unbelievable. I went with 3 other friends and they were all dissatisfied with the food n hawkers. Never will we go there again."
Nice spot for a quick meal but the food was average at best. The roti chanai was good other than that everything else we had wasn't including the chendol and chicken rice.
"Fried oyster with only 2 oysters?!?!? C'mon, why so stingy?!?!"
"Zero star. The kwey Teow soup has only a few strand of noodles swimming in the soup; One piece of fish cake, half piece of  meat and liver each, and one fish ball.  Rojak  tasted terrible with chunks of cucumber and bungkuan.. Fritters were hard like stone and can't even bite. Paid $8.50 and still need to look for food.  Won't visit again. Not recommended."
"Tried their claypot rice, BaSheng Rou Gu Cha, their sesame chicken, their chendol, their Hainan Curry Rice, fish maw kway teow. All VERY GOOD!"
"Malaysia Boleh is our go-to food court because it has something each of my family members likes to eat.

My daughter has the ban mian every time and it is her favourite ban mian out of all the food court versions she's tried. The noodles are springy and the soup is tasty, and for a small bowl, the price point of $4.50 is not only affordable but good value.

I had the chicken claypot rice. I enjoy a piping hot bowl of claypot rice with as much black sauce as I can help myself to. The rice at the bottom is crunchy and there are bits of salted fish. My only quibble is that the chicken pieces are a bit fatty. Other than that, for $5.80, it's quite a perfect meal. Oh, I couldn't find chilli also, which would have brought my meal to another level.

Drinks at Malaysia Boleh are also not expensive. Canned drinks less than $2 with a huge cup of ice. "
"So far this place, the food is least appetising, compare to Malaysia Boleh I Ang Mo Kio and Great city."
Decent hawker fare and pricing. Hainanese Chicken Rice is reasonably priced and tasted okay!
"Good food but horrible attitude by the staff. I am completely aware that their QR code payment is only for Shoppee Pay, I don't need them to reiterate that they can't accept other modes. And the tone and response of their replies need to be addressed."
"Terrible, bought the bak ku teh for $7 and only got 3 small pieces of pork"
The usual stores similar to the few other outlet. The char koay teow is rather wet and sticky and short of wok hey. Penang rojak is ok though. Popiah is short of the wet soup that is usually simmer at the top. Overall still OK but hope to see new stores though.
Authentic and affordable Malaysia food in Katong. It's very crowded on s Saturday evening. Fried Kuay Teow and Chendol are good. I stay near by so definitely gonna come back and try other food as well.
"KL Char Siew Mee - i actually feel sad for the noodles when i first saw it when presented to me. Yes, SAD! 4 piece of CharSiew and that pathetic look for S$5.50. Full lean meat so it's not that tender to bite. Wanton soup.... my recent Onsen trip water is hotter than the soup. The Wanton is ""soggy"" inside think the meat is too finely minced. Not good even for a ""eat all wonton mee"" lover like me. A 1 star plate for me. Not to order in future.

Orh jian or Oyster omelette for $5 a plate. Search no more, there is only 1, 2, 3 oysters in it. Taste vice is better than wanton mee. Chilli vice is ok, besides the very small portion generally ok to order. A 3 star plate for me. ""Chin Chai eat lah""

Chendol looks pale when first got it. The picture is already taken in food mode (mei yan). The chendol is too pale green, it's hard... oh mine. Tips if your are eating, dig from below and get all the miserable Gula Melaka up to mixed with before you eat. It will give you more flavour at least. I am ok with the sweetness but my claims that it is not enough and no fragrance of gula melaka. 2 stars on this dish. Order it only when you really have the urge."
Nice wonton noodles!
The food here taste reasonably good. Love their Yee Mian soup and PoPiah.
Don't go. Period
"Rip off, food quality and style are far from real Malaysia food.
Tried the Penang laksa, noodle soup rojek, all very disappointing"
"The worst service from the hock Kien mee stall, which not really serving with real chili but Cili padi? The staff not really friendly I think the boss should take note that your staff are not look happy at work! Hope can get better service next time!"
"Came malaysia boleh I12, cost maintain $4.50 to $6.00. Lesser stalls than Jurong point."
"Many nice food. Some you don't noticed it because it's not on the shinny colourful signboard..

For example they have satay, ramlee burger, laksa, soya bean drink"
The fruit rojak is really good. The yiu tiau is crispy and done well.. yummy
"Was very noisy as the sound of the kitchens and air conditioning and music all combined, making it hard to hold a conversation.

Food wise, it was ok. Nothing fancy, as there is little difference between the ""Penang"" food that was advertised, and the usual ""Singapore"" food all around."
"Good variety of hawker fare at affordable prices! Food court is also not very packed, easy to get a table."
"Went on Sunday. . the stall selling chinese paus, the stall attendant was very rude. Didnt even bother  when i told him i wanted to buy. Dont go..Mark that stall. Prices are not cheap either."
"Worst Malaysia boleh ever, even the halal one beats this. Chilli Pan Mee no chilli, ask the lady and sha gave me attitude. Char kway teow no wok Hei"
"Avoid the lunch hours, busy and for good reason, lots choices."
Wanna to buy the peanut pancake for my son however the girl behind the counter said is not for sale... the idea is to push for those pancakes >Sgd 1.60...... what a way to run the business
"Authentic Malaysian street food. Most of the popular treats can be found here, the Singaporean favourites. KL style Hokien mee, char kwey teow, Klang bak kut teh, Penang assam laksa, wanton mee, cendol, the list goes on. The same taste as what you'd get where they come from.
My favourites are KL style Hokien mee, char kwey teow and Penang assam laksa. Definitely recommended for those craving for hometown food."
"Pricy place for meals. Setvice so so. Food wise, i still think the Malaysian version tasted more authentic. Perhaps it is due to the katong area with higher spending power."
"Came here for lunch today as a party of 2, one ex Malaysian and one Malaysian, meaning our expectation of Malaysian food is higher than others.

Do note that the Malaysian palette is different from that of Singaporeans, food is savory and not sweet so if you have a sweet tooth and prefer sweet dark sauce, I suggest your avoid this place as you will find the food salty.

The curry was pretty standard for a Malaysian curry noodles. The chicken however was rather tough, no thanks to the fresh boiler chicken export ban, which is still in effect. Hopefully there will be fresh chickens coming from other sources soon, then the chicken will be more tender and tasty.

The mee hoon kway is pretty much the benchmark KL mee hoon kway, using nice anchovies and proper greens. The soup is tasty, light and not too thick. Mee hoon kway was soft, cooked to perfection despite sitting in the soup during the meal.

The char kway teow had pretty good ""wok hei"" and the lard lubricated the kway teow very nicely. No cockles here as this is the penang style of char kway teow. Again, not Singaporean style, no sweet dark sauce used.

All in all a pleasant lunch where each item cost $4.50. I had a bad experience with the Tampines One ba kut teh as the soup is meagre and refills are chargeable so I have it a miss."
Nice choices. Good food and lots of seating.
Service at some of the stalls there sucks big time especially the chap at the drinks stall who is so darn rude. Expensive and food portion is small. Taste wise is so so only.
"First time coming here.

The KL Char Siew mee at $5.50 was way too sweet even with a lot of chilli in it. The char siew on its own was delicious.

The praw mee soup while nice was also a tad too sweet for my liking.

The char kway teow was excellent as it had a right balance of ingredients and had some crunchy bits in it.

The chendol was the worst of the lot. It was tasteless and had too much coconut milk in it. You get much better chendol at Alexandra Village food centre.

Overall the dining experience was pleasant as there are many options to choose from."
The Cendhol and the carrot cake were good here
"Tried 1st time & the food quality was lousy, small portion sizes. Thought I try again to give it another chance. Alas, it was even worse. The popiah at $2.50 each is the worst I had in my entire life. Skin was soggy & ingredients tasteless. Don't know what I was eating. Very disappointed. No more chance for Malaysia Boleh."
Most stall foods are good and affordable.  Dinning area's mechanical ventilation system very noisy.
"Average fare, nothing too spectacular and portions are small, which is good for sharing and trying different stalls. Damansara chilli ban mee tastes ok though noodles quite thick and too chewy"
the staff are rude as hell. saw a few things customers were mocked or shouted at. i was personally shouted at for asking if an item was available.
Takes 25 mins for prata store when there's no queue and charge 50cents for ice
"As mentioned in another blog post recently, the latest hawker food addition to Malaysia Boleh at I12 Katong; Mr Prata, is a major dismal and utter insult to Indian food enthusiasts. They just use factory made pratas like those you get from the frozen section in supermarkets, cracked an egg on top of the dough and call it a day! What a long awaited letdown. Not Boleh!"
Nice msia hawker food
"Worst customer service I've had in Sg. Popiah was tasteless. Cold and not much filling. Hokkien noodle too salty and taste nothing but pork oil. Wanton noodle ordered extra noodle but gave us less than those who order normal portion. Too oily for a wanton noodle. Char kueh Teow taste nothing but chilli only. Lots of other Singapore hawker food serve much better Malaysian food compared to this so called ""Malaysia Boleh"" restaurant. What a disappointment! Will not go there again."
Stlandard not as good for some stalls. Rude staff.
"There are a number of hawker stalls but most serve mediocre food. The ones which I find acceptable are fried kway teow  rojak and popiah. The worst are claypot rice, prawn noodles and wanton noodles. Most of the hawkers cook without passion. It is simply assembly work, ie they just throw the ingredients into the pot or wok, and serve when cooked."
Late lunch at i12 Katong and decided to try Malaysia Boleh. Ordered the fishball noodles and the white fried carrot cake. The dishes still taste really good. Worth to try it out here ! 
"Never again. Deserves a 0. Poor quality with little or no taste or  no ingredients plus being pricey.
Penang laksa and kway teow do not have any visible ingredients (except 2 small prawns for kway teow).  I supposed one is supposed to get extras. Why do customers have to pay for extra ingredients when the base price is so high?
Popiah is bland. Youtiao roajak was just that with nothing else, not usual fruits plus youtiao.
Satay was probably best but pricey.
Overall, not good or value for money at all. Disappointing quaity and a never again place."
I've tried dry chili ban mee and mee hoon kueh so far. Love how thick and chewy the noodles are.
"Ridiculous store !!! They must be very proud of their MSG seasoning clay pot rice, after eating u feel extremely thirsty and have to drink 3liter water"
"Came here because I was craving for a soupy snack in the afternoon - pleasantly surprised to see many people here. The place was much bigger than I thought, and the ID was tastefully done with the fake concrete walls and round tables.

I tried the kway teow soup which was sooooo delicious. Easily Top 10 in Singapore - I was so pleasantly surprised. Tasted similar to ban mian but with fishballs and fishcake and mince pork.

The food looked really good, seemed authentic and was cooked by Malaysian chefs, will come again with friends and family."
"Able to spot the difference between the two plates of Penang fried kway teow?

We ordered one plate of Penang fried kway Teow, one bowl of Penang prawn beehoon soup, and a plate of rojak for sharing.

As usual, the prawn beehoon soup and rojak never fail us.

We did not realise that there was no ingredients (i.e., prawn or Chinese sausages) in the fried kway teow, until we almost finished the plate and we asked each other how many prawn had each eaten.  We were glad that the stall supervisor apologised and gave us a new plate.  So, please remember to check it the next time."
"I ordered pohpiah and it was ready in 2 seconds, literally. I just had my first bite. It was COLD. Not sure if their SOP is to prepare food beforehand but pohpiah should be served hot. Disappointed.."
Ordered an ice teh oh and it came piping hot. Requested for more ice to make it colder and the guy in pic was really rude and demanded for 50cents. He even said that he poured hot tea with ice so it is obviously hot...what twisted logic? We ordered iced tea for a reason.
Best foodcourt with quality food served in non plastics bowls.
ROJAK STORE: I went to eat the rojak thrice and the lady just automatic upsize plus 1 dollar. I asked why and the asked me to ask her boss... the third time I told I want the original price she said cannot. So I asked for a refund. Not right man.
"I been to most of the Malaysia Boleh outlet in Singapore for my meal. It was my 2nd time to Katong I12 outlet and today the taste of my usual order totally below expectation. Especially the Char Kuey Teow. It's totally disappointed. The bottom of the noodle is cold and the taste is lack the ""wok hey"". Only the Chicken Rice maintain the taste. Hope to find the Penang taste again."
"Malaysia Boleh! Opens Its Third Outlet At i12 Katong. These stalls will suit your appetite and you enjoy the taste of authentic Malaysian cuisine!

Some of the recommendations:
Claypot Chicken Rice & Klang Bak Kut Teh
If you're in the mood for some rice, the Claypot Chicken Rice ($5.50) is definitely one to go for! Drizzled with dark soy sauce, sesame oil and a splash of Chinese hua tiao jiu, the dish is undeniably fragrant. The chicken is tender and marinated well, while slices of lup cheong and salted fish add an umami oomph, elevating the flavours of the rice when eaten together!

Nothing beats a comforting bowl of hot soup and the Klang Bak Kut Teh ($6) definitely hits the spot! For Malaysian Bak Kut Teh, the soup is more herbal.

The Chendol ($2.30) emulates the famous Penang Road Chendol.

The ambience and decor closely evoke the street food vibes of Malaysia. Worth exploring if you are around Katong."
"Hainanese Curry Rice- way too sweet. Pork Bak extremely sweet!!
Claypot Chicken is good."
"Finally a food court in I12Katong. Not pricy and large variety of stalls and food to choose from. Basically Malaysia food! Ample sitting space. Not to be fooled by the small entrance, walk in and round the corner long stretch of stalls and sitting space. Clean and spacious"
Lots of seating. The bak teh was delicious as well as the clay pot rice. My son loves the steam bun options. Very clean
"Food wise so-so. Disappointed with Th outcome of the rojak dish.  Fritters are fried and hard,  other pieces like pineapple sourish,  same for mango. These are chunky n not easy to digest fur older folks. Hokkien noodle was OK."
"Always good food at Malaysia Boleh!

Had the Curry Chicken Noodles, Chicken Claypot Rice and Popiah! Loved the Popiah "
"This is another outlet of the Malaysia Boleh.. I tried their original one at jurong point. I would say its a very good effort to try to bring Malaysia food into sg shores. The food are no doubt decent and well portioned.

One should not have the expectation that it is of the best standard that Malaysia has to offer. There is definitely better dark hokkien mee, popiah, apom balik etc. However, the standard is decent to satisfy a craving for Malaysians even without crossing the boeder."
"No food is available at 9pm when the closing time is 10pm, waste my time"
Go and try Malaysia Boleh @ Jurong Point. Then you will know which is worth it and taste better. Condiments also not as stingy as in Katong's branch.
"Malaysia Boleh offers many options for you to enjoy. It features mainly on Penang, KL and Klang food.

The stalls include popiah, rojak, char kuay tiao, hokkien mee, char siew mee, hainanese curry rice, claypot rice, chili ban mian, Kway Tiao soup, mee hoon kueh, loh bak, carrot cake, etc

We tried their Bak kut teh at $7. The soup base is herbal. However noted that there's no refill of soup.

The ee mian is normal at $4.50.

I love the interior decoration and vibes.

#ILoveMalaysiaBoleh"
Don't eat bakuteh at Malaysia Boleh katong i12..just 3 very small so call rib in the soup and they charge small bowl of white rice for 1 dollar total paid 7 dollar not worthy.. taste of the soup..so so only nothing great and never reach close to malaysia bakuteh
"The assam laksa is definitely not assam laksa. Not only it doesn't look like assam laksa, it is not even close to the taste of assam laksa. Rojak also failed, no where near the taste of Malaysian rojak. However, the wanton mee was good."
"This is NOT Assam laksa from Penang. Who are you trying to kid by dumping sardine tomato, onions in an awful stew? There is NO KEMBUNG FISH AT ALL.  It's also full of starch. How can you expect people to eat this abomination ?!?"
"The food is comparatively better in this outlet than others. I highly recommend clay pot rice and the bak gu tei stores, which serves authentic Malaysian version. The black friend noodles is also a must-try here (my Malaysian friend said it's like home). So if you are near this Mall, do try the food"
Some of the food here are nice. Some are overpriced and average taste. The Klang BKT for example was overpriced and not much meat inside. The CkT and the ban mee I thought was great
"Penang prawn soup noodles (hae mee) was good, quite close to the authentic tastes of Penang. Char Koay Teow was ok, not too bad for Singapore standard. Overall a good experience, will come back"
"They say

Cheap food is not good.
Good food is not cheap.

Not true for the food I bought today "
Didn't eat in here but the foods are interesting. Have eaten somewhere else before came here. Will try next time. It wasn't that packed when I visited.
The soup was good. Don't think this stall is at AMK outlet.
I seldom give poor ratings so you can imagine how bad the food was. The KL Hokkien Mee was probably the worst I have ever eaten ( I have tried quite a number in Singapore). It has no wok hei and the taste is bland. You almost feel sorry and angry for yourself to gain calories on this dish. I won't try again. Hope to hear if anyone else agrees
"1st time I tried was at Jurong years back,  it was not bad. Since I live in the East,  I will go to East Point mall whenever I have craving. I stopped going after the food standards dropped. Today I was at I12 Katong, thought what the heck. Let's gave it a go..... should have listen to my husband.
Ordered fried kway ka (carrot cake), instead was served white carrot cake. Told me they don't have what I ordered when questioned. If it's tasted good, I can still accept it but yikes !
My husband ordered char kway teow and prawn noodles,  just as bad.
Conclusion- Never again "
"I think the food here is cheap, good and authentic. A good addition to the katong area for simple Malaysian comfort food!

Pan mee and oyster omelette was good! Dk about the rest.."
"Really popular, and there was a queue to get in.  Food was okay, but nothing outstanding.   The ckt was okay, though could have used a bit more wok hei."
Good malaysian food.
"Assam laksa was lukewarm, bland and bitter with hardly any fish found in the dish. Popiah was tasteless and soggy. Chendol was so-so. Overall it is a disappointing dining experience."
"Hokkien Mee Stall Employee was loud and rude to redirect customer to actual pay station despite me asking politely whether it's available because no one manning the counter. I also Ordered Bak Kut Teh and Oyster Chicken, chef then asked me what rice...""quick quick quick"", I thought he asking if I wanted a bowl of rice to go with it but he rudely corrected me and asked me BAk Kut Teh, Claypot sesame or clay pot chicken , GOT 3 TYPES ONLY!!! WTF.... I replied I ordered with him liao why he still ask. Very disappointing with both stalls I encounter today. Btw Chilli Pan Mian is good. The rest can try at own risk.... Beware of some of their attitude especially from both stalls I mentioned above. Soup machiam hot water... "
Very poor service from the Penang Carrot Cake stall. Gave the wrong order and was completely unapologetic. Will give this a miss next time.
This place stresses me out because hard to decide what to eat. So many nice dishes. Chendol good - Lots of gula melaka. I love the black and slightly sweet Char Siew noodles. Something I missed from my childhood days. Char siew was fatty and succulent. Amy yip pau was one of the best big pau I've tasted. It has Chinese sausage in it which is quite unique for pau. Popiah good. Hokkien mee very good and tasty. Rojak good. Bak kut teh different but nice - More pork and garlic taste than herb and pepper. Clay pot chicken rice also different with a lot of sesame chicken gravy. Quite nice and rice still stuck to bottom of pot. Assam laksa was good but next time I'll ask for more prawn paste.
"Just had char keow tiao, it was ok but the person taking the order was abrupt and kinda rude. It's 6pm and he tells me they don't have change for a 50sgd??amazing service and only shoppee pay available Their standards are dropping, seriously."
"Ate twice.First time had the hokkien mee.Tasteless and expensive.Second time tried the bak kut teh.Very bland and watery.Might as well drink hot water.$6 for that.
Its only convenient for me thats about it.If i walk slightly further to the hawker center..the food is way better.
Staffs are not friendly.They dont speak english.Even if you reply back in english they still talk to you in chinese.Are we becoming another China?
They only accept cash and Shopee pay.No credit card no NETS no Paywave.
Overall if only i am desperate or lazy then i will eat here.Other that...dont bother.If they keep going on like that,theyre gonna lose alot of businese when Kopitiam opens up just across."
"Assam laksa was very salty, needed some sweetness. Correct type of noodles. Fish was smelly, not sardines."
it's not a 24rhrs stall
The Salted Fish fried rice is really for Fans of salted fish . Chunks of freshly fried salted fish in every mouthful of fried rice . Lovely .
"I ordered Dory Fish Seafood Soup and my thought was that it was value for money with the generous amount of ingredients given, however the soup was not amazing, and I got to try 1 slice of Batang Fish and I felt it was dry and not fresh. Dory Fish, Minced Meat and Prawns were fresh, and the portion was sufficient for me. Better than average seafood soup stall and worth trying if there is no queue."
"Brought and recommended by friend for this SK Seafood Soup at Marsiling Lane Food Centre

Had the Batang Seafood Soup $9.50 medium size, Braised Pig Trotters $6.50.

Soup loaded with 3 big prawns, big slices of batang fish and big chunks of minced meat. Soup is really fragrant and robust. Amount of soup is much more compared to Yan Ji at Marsiling Market.

Pig trotters are well braised, fatty and lean good combination. Amount also good for the price.

1 really good seafood soup in the north.

Queue is to be expected for this stall all the time during their operating hours."
"I agree that the fish is tasteless, so next time i will spend extra dollars upgrade to better fish. Currently they are using the Vietnamese Dory fish.
Minced Meat & prawn & soup are amazing. must try."
"Queued for an hour, only to find out it was cash payment only. I didn't bring any cash and could only use PayNow, so I ended up not eating. Maybe they should consider adding a PayNow QR code for convenience."
"I ordered no 3, $8.5 ones, had 3 big prawns.  My friend ordered $7 ones, 2 big prawns.  Surprising the minced meat lumps were very well marinated, meaty taste.  Prawns were big and fresh.  Fish slices were abit below average, tasted like those frozen dory fish.  Soup infused with seafoods flavour, umami, drank all :)"
Tang Di Yi Liu!must try
"Very tasty and delicious fish soup - from the first sip. Generous fish portions to go with the rice.

Two downsides - the long queue, and that I wish there was a bit more soup."
Best seafood soup for me in Singapore hawker centre.
"Ordered batang at $9.50 with 3 big prawns blanched to perfection, 3 huge slabs of mince pork, generous amount of batang fish slices. Recommended!"
my favourite malaysian style seafood soup. seafood is fresh and affordable. i love the crayfish and dory combo.
Portion of the Seafood soup was huge! Ordered the $8.50 soup which was (M) size. Very generous servings with 3 large prawns and bug chunks of fish & mince meat. Be sure to bring cash as they don't accept digital payment.
"I just had my 3rd experience. $8.50 for a bowl of seafood soup - several big prawns, lumps of pork, fish pieces in rich stock.  Except for being a bit salty for me*, everything was good.  The gentleman running the stall was friendly, unhurried.  The queue moved quickly enough.  Food centre is old school but clean, spacious. Car park no issues at all. Post-dinner, there are enough shops to top up on fruit, bread, household provision.  *saltiness: That is my personal preference."
"One of my go to seafood soup place. Soup is very rich and flavorful. Inside the soup got some very tasty pork meat, fish and shrimp. Portion is also quite generous. I always leave satisfied.

Service is also consistently fast. I only need to tell where I sit and the uncle will bring the food in no time.

Only minor downside is there are quite a lot of birds in the coffee shop, especially near the tray return area. Picking a good seat location really matters."
"One of the better seafood soups Singapore. The regular seafood soup comes filled to the brim with a mixture of minced meat, fish and prawns. However, the chilli being only standard cut chillies in soy sauce is quite disappointing."
"One of my favourite seafood soup. Generous ingredients, prawn size is huge. Love the sweet stock base soup. Chunks of delicious meat. Pork trotter so so. Expect a queue."
"Very worth it for the price. Taste of the soup is on point, plenty of ingredients and uncle makes to order. Highly recommend this, this store deserves more reviews!!"
Tried the crayfish batang fish soup and the seafood soup. Delicious and tasty with two big fresh prawns with each bowl of soup that come with huge pieces of tasty minced pork on top of a fresh and sweet crayfish and batang fish slices for the crayfish batang soup and good amount of (I think) dory fish slices for the seafood soup.
"$7 for the basic seafood soup here seems ex at first.. but with the amount of ingredients it's justified.. the soup is tasty not too salty, prawns are fresh, minced meat also nice.. fish is tasteless. Waiting time today abt 20mins."
My favourite stall to patronise whenever I am at this hawker center. I would usually order batang fish without prawns and the portion of minced meat to replace is a lot. The soup is flavourful and not too salty. Sometimes would order without rice and it's filling already.
"Prawns are big and fresh, and the portions are generous"
Famous but I found it a so so seafood soup. Feel the one at old airport hawker centre is nicer. But they are generous with the ingredients. Takes super long to prepare the soup so prepare for a long wait
"When we dine at hawker centers, we don't dine for the ambience. The best we could hope for would be the chance at a tasty portion of food at a reasonable pricing. At SK Seafood Soup, nestled at a corner of a food center at Marsiling Lane, one would be treated to a veritable treasure trove of seafood at a relatively affordable price. My portion of seafood soup worked out to be $9.50 and that's a hefty price by any margin, let alone at a hawker center.

But before we jump to conclusions, and in case the picture isn't doing reality justice, the portion and quality makes the price a pittance. I got multiple hefty chunks of Batang fish and massive pork logs filled with mince pork, grinded sole fish and mushroom. To round up the deal, i got 3 huge prawns to seal the deal. While the fish is of the frozen variant and isn't the best, the prawns are sufficiently fresh, easily testified by how easy they were to deshell. The star of the show has to be the pork logs, and i mean logs, not balls. They are hand pounded and fits the cue handmade to a tee. The marination is masterful and the addition of the sole fish and mushroom seals the deal.

That being said, the soup base lacks some of the umami it had from previous visits. Possibly due to a reduction of dried scallops? It's an extravagant ingredient so that is understandable. It's still a somewhat rich tasting bowl of soup.

I have minimal complaints for $9.5, what can we really buy at $9.5 nowadays?

I also tried their pig trotters, while it is flavorful and has a thick soy sauce base laced with dried chilies, it isn't cooked for a long enough time for the gelatin and tendons to be sufficiently tender. It lacks the kind of fall off the bone tenderness which defines a pot of wonderfully cooked pig trotters. The portion is decent and i can't complain too much for a price of $6.50.

Due to their manpower issue, they are adopting a self service model and that meant that i had to wait a whooping 40 minutes for my food. It would be nice if they had an electronic system to facilitate orders and pickups.

All in all, it's very affordable for the portion and quality it offers, a snaking queue says it all. Other than some blemishes, it remains a place that i would travel to and brave the crowd for. A worthy haunt for a foodie."

"I would prefer this stall than ""Yan Ji"", have been patronizing boss for around 10 years

Ordered ""Batang seafood soup""
Won't go wrong as the ingredients were fresh as usual. Check out the portion!

Only downside is this market cleanliness can be improve, too much birds flying around"
"The soup is nice

All is fresh

"
"Soup standard tasted like before although price increased to $7 (updated on Mar '23). For the price, 2 prawns, sumptuous of minced meat cake and dory fish cube are in generous portion, so value for money. But I do preferred the soup be more flavorful. Overall, will go back again for their seafood soup especially on a raining day. Expect some wait as this stall is quite popular."
"I have eaten a fair amount of seafood soup. The seafood soup here is good. Even my picky 3 yo girl loves to eat it. Price wise I feel that it is just normal price. However, compared to other places, there are more meat. My only complain is to have more soup."
"Woodlands is spoiled for choice when you talk about Seafood soup. There are a couple of seafood soup stalls but this is the one that I will still go to, if I am craving for seafood soup. As I personally prefer more soup, this stall soup is filled to the brim, but recently I feel the soup is slightly watered down. Hopefully they will not reduce the ingredients due to the rising raw ingredient cost. A normal bowl of seafood soup will consist of sutchi fillet which is also known as dory fish, shelled prawn and most importantly their handmade meatball, which I believe is the most important ingredient to the soup."
"The seafood soup and pork trotters are very good. Always had their seafood soup when I am around the area. Tried their pork trotters today (sold out the last time I wanted to try). The soup is really tasty and flavourful, with dried chilli in it for that extra kick. The skin was clean and the fats were melt in your mouth kind. Good choice if you want some  collagen for supple skin."
Fish soup is nice. Like the taste of the soup.
Very Good Seafood Soup...
Craving for this. Ordered the batam seafood large $10.50 and stewed pork leg $4.50. Opened for dinner at 4.30pm. The seafood soup with the minced pork fired up your appetite. A wonderful dinner.
Still good as ever. But price increased again ..
"nice n tasty, sweetness of soup is just nice n ingredients are ok. will definitely return when nearby"
"Ordered the big portion with generous amount of meat, fish and prawns. Soup is great, on the lighter side but still packed with flavors. My personal favorite is always the minced meat (so much flavors!!)
$7.5 with rice, definitely value for money! "
2.5stars feel like it is overpriced if using dory fish.
The seafood soup broth taste awesomely good. Very fresh seafood and reasonably priced.
"Had the batang (mackerel)seafood soup (misspelt as Batam on the signboard), soup was tasty and slightly sweet. For $6.50 it's quite worth it, 2 prawns, 3 big pieces of minced meat and 5-6 slices of fish. The minced meat had sole fish in it so it was very tasty. Went on a Sunday at 1pm so it had a queue, waited for less than 30mins. Saw a few customers coming to the store to ask about their order,so if you come on a weekend, you probably have to be patient."
Nice soup ... friendly boss!
"Awesome seafood soup. Ordered 3 x big one. Too bad the batman fish have sold out, hence have to choose dory. The old uncle patient and friendly. I suggest you give exact amount or self collect to help the uncle. The red leg prawn is fresh and the minched meat with sole or salt fish are awesome. Soup is sweet too. Not thirsty taste hence no msg ba. Next tiem will try the crayfish as they are huge too. One blk away at blk19 there is another seafood soup stall sell similar wonder are they related since both initial are SK too."
"Big portion, taste good, value for money. Very well packed for take away."
Boss using bare hand to grab slice fish instead of spoon. And that was after collecting money! I am very shock to see this unhygienic standard ! Soup base was average only
"4.5 stars for this stall. The taste, portion (esp the soup) is decent an reasonable. Don't feel thirty after eating. By the way, I had the $7 portion, no. 3 (pls see their price at sign board). I would highly recommend!!!"
"Seafood soup is pretty amazing. Located in marsling market. Recommend you to try unless you are picky about the hygiene level of the market. With prawns, fish and pork in the soup for SGD 6. Hearsay there are other seafood soup in the area so i don't know yet which one is the best"
"I love hawker food like this. Clear soup with hint of tomatoes taste refreshing. But can be Thicker.
Good portion of Minch pork meat, 2prawns, generous of fish meat, for sgd6.  this better than the one selling at marsiling mall hawker. At least no burnt taste on the soup. The chef with good service. Will be back."
Fresh seafood soup and reasonable serving of soup as compared to the famous one nearby . Soft and tender pig trotter gives extra umm to the meal !
"Too bad, their promfet seafood soup is sold out. I had their normal seafood soup.

Seafood soup (4/5)
Well the soup was quite robust, and less on the salty side, which I like it now where the soup is not too heavy. However dont get wrong that the soup is on the light clear type.

I wouldnt say much about the dory fish, the prawn was fresh, big and succulent. The handmade meat ""ball"" or should I call it meat roll was long and flavourful. You could still see the sliced mushroom in every piece of the meatroll. It was still made in the traditional way where dried fish powder was used to greatly enchanced the taste.

They used pretty good quality rice as well where each grain of rice was fluffy and doesnt clump together.

If their presentation was better, it definitely will win much more people hearts."
"This hawker stall is manned by a couples for many years.  I asked for a $8 Batang sliced fish soup with 2 rolls of minced pork meat which was quite special and flavourful.  I purposely requested for 2 minced meat otherwise he would give too many from my past encounters.  The fish was fresh and the broth was cloudy, robust and tasty yet light on the palate."
"Batam fish was sold out on Sunday dinner time, so we ordered $8 portion dory fish soup instead. Generous fish chunks & minced meat, but the soup must have been generous on MSG as well, to make me thirsty all night.."
Seems like if you buy their more expensive soup then you get served. Else it is self service. 
"One of the best! Order the largest $7.5. Can exchange the prawn for more meat and fish. Unlike others, the hawker here is very generous with their soup"
"Ordered the grilled fish but taste like fried fish instead with super salty soup with no whatsoever taste of Qing Jiao.

Do avoid their skewers as its so hard to chew and it felt like fake meat.

Wouldn't revisit again."
"The skewers at the BBQ were a bit cold, and the taste was just average , so-so. The cashier was a bit dishonest--when I was paying, she didn't clearly explain that there were set meal options, and she had a bad attitude when she made a mistake in calculating the bill."

"The taste of the fish and the sauce ( soup ) getting from a  good taste to now diluted and standard overall drop.

The skewers are  cold  and dry .

Hopefully, they can improve. "
"Ordered the chicken & fish single person portion ($10.90-ish) & wasn't expecting much but when the beeper sounded & we went to collect the food, we were shocked at the HUGE PORTIONS.

The chicken & fish were laden with mushrooms, several vegetables, tau pok, black fungus mushroom, corn, etc. to make a nice flavourful soup base.

Many restaurants serve this type of Kao Yu with very salty & strong taste (Chong Kou Wei) but this one's flavourful enough without being too hard on your kidney.

Fish texture was great & fish was fresh and so was the chicken. Would definitely recommend & return for more. Super value for money. Please stay this way if not we'd have lost a gem"
"Order beef, pork and lamb skewers. Very disappointed. All the meat are too tough to chew. Also, they have minimum order of two skewers per item regardless of how much total items ordered."

Reasonable price and enough for 2pax.
"Ordered the Chongqing grilled fish. It was for $19.9 only. Something good about this place is that they serves individual portion at $10.90/$11.90.

4 adults shared the $19.9 find it a bit not enough. Should have added some other stuff to it.

Taste wise it is good."
"It's not grilled fish. It is fried fish instead. Taste so so, won't be revisit kind. But price definitely cheap."
"Base on taste alone this is just 2 star.  Fish is fish, soup is soup, if it is just putting fish on top of a sour vegetable soup than this dish will not be so famous in Singapore.
What makes this 3 star is;
Price is affordable (there is $21 and $11 version)
Cozy weather when I am eating it (it starts to rain)
The fish seems to be fresh (can't tell since it is deep fried, but the meat is tender and fresh)
Not very crowded in the hawker today
Some street singer singing and give a free bgm
Kids playing and screaming happily at the open area
All this added together suddenly give me a weird sense of peace and harmony, plus a sense of belonging...."
"Very friendly staff at the counter, full of smile and is humorous toward customers. However, fish is mediocre in flavor (bland), but it's tender. 3 stars for the staff but 0 star for the fish."
My favourite soup stall in the North
Worth the price. $18 for 1 mala grillsd fish. Taste normal and not spicy but the price is reasonable for such big portion. Will definitely come back again!
Cheap and good. Lunch.
They sell herbal soups too but are best known around the area for their grilled fish dishes which are served at a pretty good price. We tried the spicy grilled fish which came in a spicy sauce with ingredients similar to mala hotpot. The fish was fresh and enjoyable with every mouthful. Would recommend.
"It's hard to stop at one for this pocketful of tofu! It's packed generously with fish cake and braised egg! Love the chili sauce that goes really well with the tau pok. This is the only place in Singapore I've eaten this! The uncle does the dish really well, which you can tell even by just eating the braised egg which is infused all the way into the yolk but not making it all hard and rubbery! Love this simple but at the same time complex dish!"
Old school food. Chilli sauce is 
The stall closes at 4pm so come early if you like to order takeaway or dine in.
"Read reviews that this is the only store in Singapore that sells this item and decided to give it a try. Msybe it's just us but both me and my husband don't find it delicious at all. Tau kwa were cold and bland. No fragrance no crunchiness from the ingredients. I don't even know what I'm eating till I read reviews that it contain stew eggs, fish balls and yam. Honestly it taste like chopped up cold left over food spread over cold soggy tau kwa."
"2025.5.28

There is practically no competition for this snack in Singapore. I don't ever recall finding this in any part of Singapore or any part of the world. I believe this is a heritage dish of Katong and I pray that this will not become extinct.

As an eastern resident since birth, I have been eating this since childhood. It's my go-to for a non-carbs meal (which is very very hard to find in hawker centers). It is also a fantastic party snack which you can order in advance, alongside with their yummy fishballs.

A testimony to how old school this is :
They only accept cash. No digital payments."
"Walked passed the Dunman Food Centre and discovered this stall that sells the original ""Taukwa Pau"" since 1959! I'm kinda intrigued by this Taukwa (a firm, bean-flavored beancurd aka Tofu, which is make into a Pau aka ""bun"" or ""baozi"" (Bao Zi).

Basically, it's like a sandwich ~taukwa is used instead of bread. As for the fillings/ingredients, I think it's some kinda of smashed braised egg and crispy stuff that I can't figure out. Garnished with coriander and special sauce. Chilli sauce is absolutely awesome  

This Taukwa Pau (half Tofu) is selling at sgd2 p/piece (ONLY cash payment, NO PayLah, Paynow etc). Typical hawker settings (quite old), where I think the place needs a makeover/refurbishment to improve on the dining experience."
"Been eating this since I was a small boy who would accompany my grandpa in a taxi to get a takeaway of tau kwa pau. Wherever they moved, we followed. 30 years later, I am glad this little-known iconic dish is still around, although the brothers running are getting old. Hoping the generations would keep the simple yet delicious recipe (especially the braised sauce and chilli vinaigrette) going for years to come.

6 tau kwa paus and 2 packets of braised duck rice with a side of egg and a portion of pork belly for $23.20 for my takeaway today!"
"This is a stall that has been selling this traditional dish since 1959. They have relocated several times and are currently on the lower floor of Dunman Food Center.

They sell only one item: Tau Kwa pau.

Essentially, it's a deep-fried beancurd, that's partially opened up and filled with a mixture of sliced up fish balls, fried yam fritters, egg, duck and pork belly.

The fish comes with a braised sauce that you drizzle over the dish. A chilli dip is also given.

This is old school and I remember having this in my younger days.

Recommended!

"
"Just come here for the tau kwa pau. Braised duck is simply daylight robbery for the small portion

Was charged $12 for this small plate of braised duck (excl. the tau kwa pau)"
Something that is not that easy to find in singapore. I cannot judge if is the best but it definitely suits my taste. Hawker itself is very clean.
"Today I explore the Dunman Food Center. The dish is called ""Tau Kwa Pau"", the main dish is a tau Kwa, with crispy stuffing (I think it is egg white), and the sauce has braised duck taste, because they do sell braised duck. This tau Kwa pau has been a feature of Katong for so long, I don't really see it sold elsewhere. The pictures TKP is $2sgd. Good for a snack. I saw an old man order 3."
"Paid $6.00 for a plate of braised duck rice plus one piece of Tau Kwa Pau. Price wise is reasonable. However, taste wise is nothing to shout about. I think the Tau Kwa Pau is a little blend. But the accompanying chilli sauce is not bad."
"Say Seng Tau Kwa Pau is a famous hawker stall known for its unique tau kwa pau, a traditional Teochew snack. The dish features fried tau kwa (firm tofu) stuffed with a mix of ingredients like hard-boiled egg, fish cake, cucumber, and braised pork belly. The tau kwa is crispy on the outside while the fillings are tender and savory. Served with a tangy, spicy dipping sauce, the dish offers a rich contrast of textures and flavors--crispy tofu, soft fillings, and a burst of umami from the sauce. It's a hearty, old-school street food with a loyal following."
usually alot of stores open is only that may wrre close on sat
Traditional tastes
"An old school dish that is hardly replicated anywhere else

$4 for a plate of 2 buns
$2 for 4 fishball
$2 for a fried ham

Definitely a lot of man hours goes into preparation, as a result most plates are not piping hot or crispy unfortunately.

Still a must try cause there's a good chance this dish wouldn't be around in decades to come"
"These filled tau pok buns are so good. Each bite feels very wholesome and shiok. Duck was OK, I would get it as a btw. but definitely will go for the tau pok buns. Even kids enjoy them. The chili sauce is also great!"
Super shiok and value for money tau Kwa pau. Uncle is also very friendly and obliging. Strongly recommend. Good food to bring to a party or pot luck too
"Say Seng Tau Kwa Pau
****************************
 271 Onan Road, Dunman Food Centre

 We have been buying Tau Kwa Paus from ""Say Seng"" since my late Peranakan father's days.  Ever since I was a child, my father would go to Katong often to buy these tasty Tau Kwa Paus.

 Now, my 2nd sister is the one who drives frequently to Dunman Food Centre and dapao these super delicious Tau Kwa Paus for us.  Please keep up the good work and effort, Say Seng Tau Kwa Pau.

* Photos are throwback photos of what we had bought from 2016 till now, 2024.

***************************

A history of the heritage Tau Kwa Paus.
---------------------------------------
* Say Seng Tau Kwa Pau"" at Dunman Food Centre, 271 Onan Road.

 The memories
****************
The fiery, tangy chilli sauce and braised duck meat soy sauce always gives a kick to the entire dish.  This dish brings me back to the days when my foster Baba father used to dapao these for the family during afternoon tea sessions for ""diam sim"" (Hokkien for dim sum).

 Eating these Tau Kwa Paus brings back tons of nostalgic memories.  I am serious about food like my foster father, and for every dish he dapaos home, he would relate to me the history of it. Such is my late father's fondness for details.

The history of tau kwa paus and how it became highly popular among the Nonyas back in the 1930s.
------------------------------------

 My late Peranakan father told me that in the old days, the duck rice seller could not finish selling all the odds and ends of the duck meat.

* So, the hawkers improvised and began stuffing various leftover ingredients into Tau Kwa Paus; making it a new dish altogether. (   Besides chopped duck meat, they also added cucumber, fish cake, hard-boiled eggs, and fried yam bits. All these are chopped up and stuffed into the Tau Kwas.)

Now in those days, the Bibiks ie matriarchs and Nonyas love playing cherkee (a coloured card game). And they like to ask the amahs to order tau kwa paus for ""diam sim"".

 Why? * Becos it was an easy snack to eat it in-between Cherkee card sessions. They could eat quickly and went back to their addictive card games again.

That is how the humble but delicious Tau Kwa Pau dish rose in status amongst the Peranakans back in those days.  The Peranakans also call it ""Orh Pau""- a mangling of the Cantonese term for purse, which is Hor Pau.

*The Tau Kwa Pau when stuffed, looks like a purse, so the Babas and Nonyas call it Orh Pau ( resembles a purse)."
"$4 per plate, considering much effort goes into chopping the fillings in small pieces and stuffed into the tau kwa."
"It was closed when the website said it was opened, what a waste of time travelling all the way there. I won't t be patronizing tis stall for a very long time"
"At this stall is only 2 in Sg, but the 1 at joo chiat is this best n price gone up lah"
I have been eating their Tau Kwa Pau for years. It's still very good. The yam fritters are also a family favourite.
"Clean taste bean curb that doesn't have the sour or gammy taste from badly made soy products, stuffing offers different texture, sauce is not overpowering."
"So happy to see that standards are kept high and consistent.
All done from scratch
Such an enjoyable breakfast"
"Let's get this straight: Say Seng isn't about fancy ambience or service. It's about legendary flavour. I've been a loyal customer since their days at 131 East Coast Road, and I believe they might be the only stall offering this unique and delicious dish.

Their tau kwa pau is a masterpiece of textures and flavours, which is essentially a perfectly fried bean curd split open and filled with savoury braised pork cubes, wedges of hard-boiled egg, chopped fried fish balls, crispy fried yam bits and refreshing diced cucumber. All these ingredients are bathed in a braised meat gravy and their signature chilli sauce, creating a symphony of sweet, savoury, and spicy notes.

Say Seng has been perfecting this dish since 1959. That's over six decades of experience, and it shows in every single bite. If you're looking for an iconic Singaporean dish packed with history and flavour, look no further than this iconic stall!"
Ordered two of their tau kwa pau. Was a little small and i believe that they sprinkled some cucumber bits on the food that was a little hard. Do not recommend this to people with weak teeth. Food had nice flavor and the braised sauce that accompanied the food was absolutely delightful.
"The famous Say Seng Tau Kwa Pau is fantastically awesome. Have been eating this since 1972 when they were at Joo Chiat corner coffee shop. Have been one of our favorites food to indulge when ever we're hungry & just head to stall, whether is at Joo Chiat, Tanjong Katong & now at Duman Rood Food Centre. Many thanks for the Amazingly Awesome food ... well done  Cheer ... "
"The one and only TKP! Just order and pick up, easy peasy, no need queue!  Family favourite, even my elderly mum can wack 3 in one go."
"Reasonable price, service is good "
Come and try.. 
Best tau kwa pau in SG.
Old Hawker centre not so hygiene N clean.
Come here specially for BF as recommended. Taste is unique added duck meat and side dishes as well. Cash payment only.
"Here for their tau kwa pau! Been wanting to try for quite awhile now. I got 2 Tau Kwa Paus for SGD4! They only accept cash for payment.

It's my first time having TKP and it's good. Willingly ate all the fishcake inside (haha I don't like fishcake/fishball). When the uncle asked if I want fishball when I was ordering, I said no w/o hesitance.

The fried yam bits gave the TKP a good bite and salty flavour, something like what bacon bits do to pastas. Love the crunch from the cucumber bits too haha. I can't tell if there is also pork inside but I tasted hard-boiled eggs too.

The braised sauce is nice but I wish they gave more! The chilli sauce portion was generous and I only had tiny dips of it because it was quite spicy to me."
The go-to fix for Tau Kwa Pau for me. Ingredients are plentiful and simply heaven when drenched in the gravy and searing chilli sauce.
"Patronized them for a few years. Prices went up from last year from $1.50 to $2. The frustrating thing is that they have recently reduced the portion of the chopped up filling quite significantly, even though its cost is quite low. It really used to taste so much more satisfying."
"Still as good as ever.  The Food Center building, however, needs to be refurbished or rebuilt at some point in the future.  Claustrophobic."
There are very very few selling this dish in Singapore today. Expect long queues during peak hours. Do try their braised duck as well.
"Food are good always
Things are getting expensive each day.
Look at the duck meat portion."
A must try here in Dunman Hawker Centre. Duck Rice & Tau Kwa Pau 
"Back and located inside basement Dunman Food Centre.

The signature tau kwa bao ! Each fried beancurd is horizontally sliced in the middle and stuffed until it is overflowing with fried fish cake, cucumber, braised egg and fried yam - all coarsely chopped.

Apart from tau kwa bao, the stall also sells braised duck rice. The offerings are very hearty with ingredients like pig's tongue, pork belly, fish cakes, eggs, etc, and their own made chilli sauce is da-bomb!"
Interesting tau kwa pau ($2 each) with generous filling of mixed ingredients that give it different textures. The sauce adds umami and the chilli gives it an extra bite. It would have been better if it had been hot or at least warm. No queue at 11 on a weekday.
Finally found this long lost stall. Not as good as I remember it.
"Weekend lunch some queue but moves quite fast. Generous portions, inexpensive. Pork belly nicely braised and tender. Rice abit dry. Will be nice if there's soup to go along. Cash terms only."
"The only place left in Singapore for Tau Kwa Pau. Sauce is savoury, chili has a nice kick and ingredients create a wonderful blend of umami and texture. Come early in the day to get these before they sell out. $2 a piece."
"The soft and tatsy braised egg bits,  springy fishcake slices, crunchy cucumber, and the beancurd, all gave a nice mixture of texture and taste to compliment each other! Though the beancurd was not so crispy on the outside as I wanted it to be, but it still gave a nice subtle chao tar fragrance and taste.
The nicely thick, rich and savoury sauce was just enough to enhance the overall taste but not to cover the taste of ingredients.
I thought 1 piece for $2 seemed very reasonable with this quality, and I hope they will continue to offer this as long as possible.
This place is for sure going to be one of the place I will bring my family and friends from Japan to try to show how good Singapore foods are!"
Appreciate the good tau kwa pau but the stall might wish to watch out for their basic hygiene standards. Handling cash and using the same bare hands to prepare food (without gloves on) is a big turn off.
"It's been many years since we had this, that we also know as hot pow, and we were hankering for a taste.
We parked in Ceylon Rd as parking near the food centre can be hard to find.
It tasted as good as we remembered. Prices were good and the service was friendly and efficient.
The centre was clean and well kept."
It's extremely expensive for a good braised duck. The tau Kwa pau has fantastic flavour and extremely delicious.
"For tau poker lovers, they will like this gem tucked in the back row basement of Dunman food centre...

Tau pok is smooth on the inside and crispy on the outside. There are different ingredients around it that really complemented the otherwise plain taste of tau pok.  Its only perfect with their chilli.

This is a nice supplement to bfast..."
The food is unique and delicious
This unique Tau Kwa Pau was good but not life changing good. Will return to try the braised duck. Cash only.
"Had Tau Kwa Pau ($2.00 each) for breakfast, was good!"
"Tau kua pao is good, delicious. Very low carbo."
Good quality Tau Kwa Pau.Reasonable price for mixed duck rice.
"Savoured every bite of their tao kwa pao , a disappearing Teochew traditional dish. Each tofu square is stuffed mainly with egg, fishball, yam, topped with a lightly flavoured soy sauce. At $4, each plate consists of 2 halves, overflowing with stuffings. Die die must try is the braised duck, tender and moist, we polished off duck, rice and shiok chilli very quickly. Worth the trip to Dunman Food Centre just for this stall."
"Super yummy duck rice. Served with white rice and sauce, the dish is well cooked and packed with flavour.

Duck rice here is unique from others as it is served with white rice. But don't let that fool you as the dish itself is still as tasty if not tastier than other traditional dark duck rice dishes. The sauce drizzled over helps each mouthful go down easy. Their signature chilli similar to those used in wuxiang shops is also surprisingly easy to eat with enough kick. I usually add fishball to my meal to make it more substantial. No soup included but the dish itself is not dry.

Only operates at selected timings. Carpark is located around but sparse."
"One of the institutions being more than 60+ year old.

Tau Kwa Pau is basically a semi-dried tofu. Here, they stuffed it with an array of ingredients such as duck, fishcake, egg, cucumber, crispy bits probably soy bean paste. All these are drizzled with a braising liquid, from the braised Duck.

One of the vanishing snacks which is such a pity to lose.

They also offer braised Duck, fishball and other protein. Highly recommended is the deep fried yam. Crunchy and deeply flavored which went excellent with the tofu.

Chili is another highlight which is spicy and tangy. Very addictive."
"I came here to try the Tau Kwa Pau and Fish Balls. After tasting, I would give the restaurant a marginal three stars.

The Tau Kwa (deep fried tofu) itself is nice, but the fillings is a bit off. The fillings gave me the impression of leftover ingredients with a lesser Indian rojak recipe. Besides, the fillings are all over the plates but inside the Tau Kwa. However the concept is unique in Singapore.

The fishballs is normal. It's very unlikely I will come back for second try."
"Old school street food & a really satisfying yummy delight! A blend of protein, crunch & savoury goodness! The duck & stewed pork belly rice comforts the tummy too!"
"Their Tau kwa bao is out of the world. The tau kwa are generously stuffed with egg, fish cake, yam and other crispy filings, doused with braised duck sauce. Taste heavenly good with the tangy spicy chili sauce!
Never tasted tau kwa bao so good before."
"Impressed by its flavourful stuffed fried tofu.
Chilli sauce is nice too to go with the stuffed tofu.
Didn't expect this texture, taste and yummy.
Thumbs up."
"I love the Tau Pow from here it's so delicious it's the best.  however the the food court needs more work although we noticed they installed new white fans and the walls been painted. Also with  new tables and benches. I think the food stalls needs to be upgraded too,they look old and it needs a good clean up."
"Definitely the best Tau Kwa Pau, there was a copycat but didn't last"
"A dying trade and the only one I know of still surviving in Singapore.  I come here often for my tau kwa pau fix. Besides this they offer fishballs, crispy yam, pigs intestines, pork belly meat and duck rice. The Babas will like this. Of late the chilli is lacking spiciness hope that they can improve on it."
"Really gooood! Hard to find Tau Kwa Pok these days, and this is definitely one of the nostalgic finds. Delicious!"
$4 for two pieces of Dou Gan. It's not value for money. There's no display of their price list. Lack of transparency. No wonder there's no queue. I rather spend $3 on Rojak or $3.50 on wanton mee.
"Quite a unique dish. The tofu is stuffed with braised duck, chopped up fish balls, pork belly, fried yam, eggs and coriander.

Delicious but very pricey."
"Revised -- stingy with poor service - half the serving size and a 33% price increase ($4 for two small pieces)  plus no cucumber/coriander must ask now

Very sad demise of a once great stall"
Nice and it has lots of fillings. Seller gave generous packets of chilli sauce.
"2nd time taupau, seems quality improves a lot. Portions is bigger and Taukwa is firm. Overall taste is good and balance"
"Just visited there last Thurs and ate 3 for my lunch. Dunman food centre is quite empty but still very hard to find parking lot. Have been eating this Tau Kwa Pau for so many years. From Joo Chiat to Tanjong Katong to Dunman. Yes, price has increased to $2 but that is after so many years and hawker life is tough. There is only this unique Tau Kwa Pau in Singapore that I know. I will support as long as they operate, if only my late-father (one of his favourite) can eat with us. Hope they survive!"
quality has dropped. it was not as tasty as before and the tau kwa pok also shrinked
Three failed attempts and finally scored today! So good even after being kept in box for quite a while.
"One of the few places that I know in Singapore which serve deep fried tofu pocket.  Good fillings, sauce, and hot sauce.  $2 per tofu but lots of filling, not quite crispy om the outside but the tofu is moist in the inside."
The one and only tau kwa pau that is unique only in Spore. Taste is good and the chilli is super shiok.
Arrived just quarter to three on Saturday and found the stall already shuttered. I'd strongly suggest that anyone who intends to give the stall a try come early in the morning to avoid similar disappointment.
"It's now $2 for 1 Tau Kwa Pau but I guess it can't be helped with inflation ravaging through everything.

The braised sauce that comes with it is really complex and the chilli ties it nicely altogether, making you want to take another bite.

If I were to takeaway, I would probably need to get at least a dozen since it is so delicious.."
Returned on 11 Mar 2022 after hawker centre renovations were complete. Price has increased from $1.50 per piece to $2 after the renovations. Used to be a family favourite but opportunistic increase in pricing by a whopping 33% is difficult to swallow.
"Opening hours needs to be updated.  Went down on 2nd Mar 2022 lunch time, and found the place close."
Sold out at 1.30pm on a Sunday  I was lucky enough to get the last piece though.
"Haven't seen many stalls selling only tau kwa. It's like your Chinese version of tau hu goreng.

Pretty good for a quick snack. Mixed with minced meat, nuts and maybe egg?"
"Qued for around 1/2 an hour for this 1 amd and only Tau kwa Pok. The fillings given are generously stuffed into the Tau Kwa. It's a must try as you won't be able to get it elsewhere. If u are at Dunman Food Centre, go to the basement and it's located at a corner.

Definitely will return for more if I'm around the corner.

Overall 4.5 /5 stars"
"Tau Kwa Pau is nice and $1.50 per piece is very affordable to the general public. However, $40 for a whole braised duck is a bit expensive..."
"came here all the way from Jurong but were closed on both days Thursday 7/10 (3pm) and Friday 8/10 (10.45am).. Will try again another day 

Verdict: 
must try
finally got my hands on this famous old school Tau Kwa Pau on Wed, 27/10/21 morning. $3 for 2pcs serving is a steal and value-for-money for its savoury taste and loaded with ingredients."
Eaten tau kwa pau since I was a kid who lived in Marine Parade. Eat the mixed rice or with braised duck.  Its yummy.
Tapao back. Great taste but like that $6.50 not too worth it.
"Still the Best Tau Kwa Pau of the EAST! Nvr fail on the ingredients and taste.... Must go early only weekends, anytime after 11.30am? Good Luck if you can place your order.... "
It's amazing. All time favourite. The flavours and texture are simply perfect. Will definitely be back for more
"An insitution in the East, ever since they were at East Coast Road. Combination of ingredients and the sauces brings back all the vivid memories of childhood having this with family. The braised duck and meat is good. The fried yam is out of this world."
"V tasty and delicious tau kwa pau. Been patronising them for more than thirty years. Previously at Tanjong Katong Rd,  East Coast Rd and later moved to Dunman food court.  Loved the chillie that comes with it.  Glad that the standard is quite consistent over the years. Highly recommended."
Original.  Best there is .
"No luck ! Visited twice in a month.
Closed on both visits !"
We brought the paus home... so tasty!! I never really had it before and didn't know the meat inside tastes so good. So many ingredients. It's a meal on its own.
"Special, traditional and unique to our local food. I have been eating Say Seng since it was in a coffee shop in East Coast Road. Nothing magical about the ingredients but it is just so magical with the combination and the duck lor sauce. Haven't visited much but the quality has still been there for ages.
Truly a dish which old and young would like."
"If there are epic food flavours I'd vividly remember from my childhood days, this would definitely be one of them. And it hasn't changed an iota since those days.

Not to be compared to the tau kwa paus you'd typically get with the Chinese rojak, this version is essentially a fried bean curd, slit in the middle, stuffed with Chinese braised pork cubes and hard-boiled eggs, chopped fried fish balls, crispy fried yam bits and diced cucumber, finished with a drizzle of the super flavourful loh chup (braised meat gravy) and their signature chilli sauce, and topped with a few random sprigs of Chinese coriander leaves.

As if these weren't enough to satisfy my cravings, I also ordered a separate plate of fried fishballs and yam fritters, which totally didn't disappoint me. The yam fritters, especially, was extremely cripsy, crunchy and so unmistakably yam-my! 

It's a taste to return for and good ol' nostalgic flavours to revisit time and again. I'm sure I'll be back for more. "
Absolutely must try. Good as snack or a meal
Came back to get 20 TKB for family. Love it! Please support our local hawker! 
The one n only
Dry bean Pau...maybe the only store in Singapore selling.
Need to book or arrive early to buy. Limited stock.
Taw kua taste very good with the chili next time will try yam and their kuay chap...
Went too late...taukuapau already sold out. Ended up buying from Dunman duck rice and vadae from the same level at basement. Both were delicious. Good find
Yummy Tau Kwa Pau
"Super nice, had it from the old location till today"
Love this unique Gu Zao Wei braised duck and tau kwa pau! Unlike anything I've tasted before. Worth revisiting!
Good food & must try
Hard to come by. Still as tasty.
Something special. Something traditional. Something represent local.
This must be the only one left
News on good food should be shared. The food here is good - the fish balls taste better with the chilli  provided. My family has been patronising this stall for years now - from their East Coast Road days. I recommend it.
Beautifully stuffed tofu
They have maintained the standard and quality of the tau kwa pau. Cheers!
Ok la... not bad
Good. Wish they had microwave to warm up the Tau Kwa Pok if you are eating there. That'll make them more delicious! 
Reasonable price tau kwa pau.  Not a common dish to be found. Try it
Still good after many years with the right balance of ingredients. Worth a trip to Dunman Food Centre.
"Heard about Tau Kwa Pau for more than 10years and it wasn't until this year that I got to taste it for the first time. The taste is not something unimaginable and though not extremely salty but it makes me thirst.

In my opinion it's more cultural/historical than for the taste. I like the fact that they still put coriander on top which many hawkers have stopped using. Will recommend if you haven't tried before."
It's good still very authentic
Excellent & unusual food fast & good to eat without fail 
a healthy diet ! ! They start early...6am and the turnover rate is quick throughout the day. Their other foods to go with the tau kwa pau are also pretty good.
Great Teochew dish.  The gravy and chilli combined with the taukwa and fillings makes the whole dish flavorful!
"Very popular their tau kwa pow,"
Tasty! Disappointed that the ingredients were scattered outside the tau gua instead of being stuffed inside though.
"Comfort food from the past. Friendly and helpful staff makes the eating experience very pleasant. Tau Kwa Pau served generously with delectable toppings of diced fishcake, slivers of braised duck and  braised pork, crunchy bits and garnishing of greens, go so well with their signature chilli dip. A mouth-watering treat for those longing for the taste of the good old days."
Simple and delicious.
"Something special which I've never seen or try before.
Taste pretty normal for me... OK to give it a try if you've never try it before.
Comes in standard portion and serving for one pax."
"Supposed to open but closed too early, unable to buy anything."
"Ya Fa Yun Tun Mian,Ji Jiao Hao Chi"
Would have been sooo much better if serve hot. I felt that the fried yam was much more flavourful than the tau kwa pay itself. Braised duck sauce lacks flavour but their chilli managed to complement it nicely. Tau kwa pau filling was filled to the brim for $1.50 per piece.
"Always a favorite when I first tasted it 30 years ago
Wonderfully tasty !"
Eaten it many times. This time went there on the request of others who wanted to try. Bought several packs for a couple dozen friends and colleagues. Definitely no complaints but requests to be added to the list for future purchases and also where to buy them.
Still as good as ever...must have been a couple of years since i last had it
Fidelity in the chilli sauce preserved for 45 years. Never fails to disappoint.
"Old school stuff, almost impossible to find."
Excellent and unique
"Tau Kwa Pau aka Tofu Bun.
Inside this Tofu pocket, you'll find a variety of ingredients - tofu, diced braised duck, fish cake, egg and a selection of veggies. This rocking combination dipped in the accompanying braised duck sauce and chili takes it to another level (flavour/taste wise). Whilst not a conventional snack, to me, it truly is one of the best snacks around!
Not featured here but definitely a worthy mention is their braised duck rice and array of duck innards."
"Te Bie,Zhi Ci Yi Jia,Bie Wu Fen Hao,Hao Chi Xin Jia Po Dao Di Mei Shi. "
Old school traditional food that is hardly found in Singapore anymore. I Guess this should be the last place in Singapore that serves up this dish. The fried beancurd is paired with their special house braised sauce and chopped up fried fishball and minced meat mix. Please try it before it's lost forever
Very kind person
Very authentic taste and having 2 of it makes a meal.
"One of the best snack in town. Tau Kwa Pao with crispy minced meat and egg, plus their special sauce with chili. The fried yam, fish ball and pork meats are essential order! Best for take away too."
Love it! Last time I had it was a decade ago. Would be perfect if served heated.
Very good!!!
"Good combination of ingredients and Tau Kwa, with a slightly sweet, sour and spicy (chilli sauce is separate) taste to spice up the flavour."
Good food. Reasonable price
"Still has the old school taste, excellent."
Super fast service and still a great taste after all these years because it's still run by the same folks.
"This stall never fails to impress me. Cannot count the number of times I have returned here for the Tau kwa pau amongst other food. Haha. Unfortunately I could only order Tau kwa pau today cos I had a super heavy breakfast. They serve very good braised duck, fish cake, yam cake as well. Price is very reasonable and the guys working there are friendly and unassuming."
Pretty much the only place u can get these tau kwa pau. Very enjoyable and affordable
Love it since young.
Tau foo with ingredients and sauce taste good
Still the best tau kwa pau.
"Still as good as last time when they were at tg katong, if not better."
Very good food specifically d braised duck & takes pau
"Today come earlier to eat this Yummy TAO KWA PAO...cant find any other store doing this....Duck, fish ball, belly pork , yam are all my favorite"
Disappointingly dry and tasteless
"This Teochew-Nyonya delicacy is actually a diminishing food item among hawker stalls today.  Hence, I wasted no time and headed down to Dunman Food Centre for 'take away' since I had already taken my roti prata at the nearby coffeeshop.  Though many other reviews claimed that the standard has dropped these days, I was delighted to try it.  The tau kwa was stuffed with chopped tiny pieces of braised duck meat, hard-boiled egg, pig intestine, crispy yam etc and topped with coriander bits.  Separately, I bought the crispy yam fritters which was tasty together with the hot chilli sauce.  Tau kwa pau was delicious and yummy plus the chilli sauce!"
"Been eating this for years, still as good!
Good for breakfast, lunch, teabreak and party takeaway too!  Closed every Monday."
Consistently good over the decades I've bought and only from Say Seng. Pleasant service & speaks English too. Great duck sauce & chillis. Don't forget to order the crispy yam pieces
Very good tai kua pau.
Many people say their food is delicious
"Still as delicious as before, when they were located at the corner of Joo Chiat and East Coast roads.  They managed to maintain their style of serving, flavour, and portion size all these years."
"As of 27 Mar 2019, the tau kwa pau is HALF its previous size. The crispy bits were like tiny pebbles that threaten to chip one's teeth. The sauce was ultra salty. Standard has gone down significantly"
"Mar 2019. The tau kwa pok was one of its kind and couldn't be found elsewhere. Despite that, it was a disappointment.
It was not even hot not to mention piping hot. It was a marsh of yam, flour cake, tau kwa and some unknown crumbs. The crumbs were meant to be crispy but turned out hard which could get stuck between my molars.
The duck meat was the saving grace. Been here done that and didn't think i would be back."
Hao Chi!Kuai Shi Chuan Liao. 
Have been patronising the stall since his father's time. Still tastes as good.
Good stuff. One & only in Singapore
Unique Tau kwa pau but not really tasty.
"Happy to be back for Tau Kwa Pau which I have not had for years. It is located at the basement of Dunman Food Centre. May not taste as good as it used to be when it was at its corner Coffeeshop. Regardless, still good enough for me to make a trip here. S$3 for a plate of 2 Tau Kwa Pau. No crowd on a Sunday morning."
"Gu Zao Wei Dou Gan Bao! This Say Seng Tau Kwa stall is the real and actual stall looking at the peoples managing the stall. Their father started the Tau Kwa Pau stall at Joo Chiat Road X East Coast Road, can see the stall from the old photo of Joo Chiat. Tilled present days the siblings are managing the business. Very traditional and special food still around. Tasty and delicious too ! Must try! 5 stars !"
Always enjoy the tau kwa pau and duck rice!
Nice authenticate food
"The fried yam cakes mixed with eggs, fishballs and other odds and ends as stuffing make the tau kwa pau unique that you can't find elsewhere. The braised duck is good too, tender and not tough."
Best duck rice and kuey chap in Dunman hawker centre - Dunman duck rice
"The standard had dropped tremendously  since their days at Katong corner coffee shop. The fillings are different. Now they only put in diced fishball and yam fritters.

The special minced crispy stuff which was one of the main ingredients was very minimal, if not totally taken off.
Sauce is not fragrant and very salty.

Bottom line is
After eating them, i believe you won't even think of returning back for some more or the urge to ta'pao home for loved ones to try, is totally zero."
Very nice tau kwa pau. $1.50 each is quite filling.
Not many hawkers sell this food now. A dying hawker trade. Probably serve by the last generation in this generation. The tau lea pok is serve fresh every day. All food iOS sold by 2pm.  No leftovers for the next day
Only had the tau kwa pau.. didn't understand what the hype was? It's just overpriced tau kwa with a side? Nehhh for me
"The Tau Kwa Pau is good. But the duck, and braised pig bits are sublime. So why bother with tofu."
Old school tau kwa pok. Used to be more tasty though.....
"One of the more unique food in Singapore, not known if there is anywhere like this in Singapore. Stall also selling duck rice, its the fried beancurb with its mixture of ingredients that make this dish unforgettable. Duck sauce used as gravy, add some of those vinegar laden chilli for extra omph. Can take away or dine in."
2 prices of Tau Kwa Pau may not be enough for a guy for a lunch and it cost $3/-. But if consider as side dish then is OK.
The only one I place I know of that sells Tau Kwa Pau with yummy fillings! The fried taro cakes are a nice complement to the meal. Duck is tender and yummy too!
Their braised duck and pork is good. Not forgetting their popular tau kwa pao. Not to be missed.
Having a cheap & nice porridge with side dishes for lunch
This stall had a steady stream of business which had me intrigued. I ordered a plate of their signature tau kwa pau and was pleasantly surprised at how well all the ingredients in the little pocket went together. An interesting heritage dish worth a try!
Nice hawker food
Taste of their famous Tau Kwa Pau is still the same since 1959. It is something that is hard to find in Singapore these days. It's a disappearing hawker dish.
A unique dish that you can't seems to find elsewhere. Not something that I will crave but I don't mind having it once a while.
One few place for great local food.
Delicious..must try !
Great art of cooking and serving alive in the world.best food and great service peace.
The one and only original.
"It used to be around the Katong area. Then, they moved to Tanjong Katong area and are now at the basement of the Dunman Road Hawker Centre. Still,  the best tau kwa bao that keeps me coming back again and again for more."
"Perfect meal. Tasty, healthy, full of protein. Love their chili sauce. 2 is good enough to fill you for lunch."
The standard of the Tau Kwa Pau remains the same since the day I was growing up in Katong
....best Tau Kwa Pau in town!
"Famous tau kwa pau stall with a popular following, despite shifting shops in Joo Chiat / Tg Katong areas in the past 2 decades.
Besides the delectable tau kwa pau, shop also serves braised duck, steamed squid, rice with assorted pork cuts, fish ball, fried yam cake, braised egg. Thick gravy and tangy chilli sauce blends with the food."
"This is the original tau kwa pau at Katong. They have shifted a few locations from East Coast Road to Tanjong Katong Road and then now to here at Dunman Hawker Center. Their specialty is the tau kwa pau which is tau kwa (fried bean curd) filled with a mixed of chopped ingredients of egg, cucumber, fish cake. The tau kwa is soft and ingredients works well with it together with their dark sauce. They also sells braised duck rice which is also yummy with their specialty sauce."
"Althought the stall name is Dou Gan Bao, they sell braised duck, braised pork, braised eggs, fish balls as well. The braised gravy is thick and flavorful. The braised gravy is the main ingredient. It's used for braised duck, pork and tao kwa pau. The tao kwa pau is quite special with ingredients like shredded eggs, fish balls, cucumbers etc. It's normally crowded but the queue moves quickly."
"$6.80, for no veggie, just the meat and rice, despite it being quite generous, is not worth it at all. Better get standard economic rice."
Nice buttermilk chicken with rice.
Food portion enough for 2. Since am a small eater. Paru is soft to bite. In queue for quite a bit of time. Price is affordable $6. Although it's a hawker centre I saw this cleaner auntie consistently wipe table after diner left . Kudos to u auntie.
"Have been wanting to try this stall for a while but I'm always only in the area after they have closed for the day. Was finally in the area early enough today. I got their nasi lemak ayam, and added on bergedil and sambal goreng. The total was only $5, which is very reasonable for 2025's prices.

I wished I could have dined in, but I was in  a hurry. The rice had a bit too much water for my liking. The sambal goreng was alright, but I regretted adding it as it covered the lemak taste of the rice. The sambal was also decent.

I would want to try the food again if I have the time to dine in."
"My family's favourite stall. Our must buy is Nasi Rawon and Nasi Jenganan. We normally select the basic set, $6 , with Paru 3-4 pieces  and Sambal Goreng, tahu tempeh goreng, serunding, blanch cabbage, long bean and tau Geh. It's my most favourite childhood menu and I am glad , it does bring fond memories.

Service was fast, but serious business, no smile, no nonsense chatting . Maybe because the Q never dies, so must be fast serving.  Overall , taste wise 5 stars."
Mee rebus is good 
"It is rare to see this laksa. The menu label it ""laksa Siglap."" Typical kampong style, look rich but taste light. The gravy is semi thicken with spices, not starch, which is applauded. Only $3.50 a plate is a steal price. Taste is not too heavy, not salty. The spices and light coconut milk complemented the thick rice noodle where I couldn't find anywhere else in Singapore. I see many old folks ordered, and lucky me got the last plate at 12 pm. The stall sold out their food by 12.30 pm. Overall, I recommend this dish if you are around this area. A good experience indeed."
Ordered Mee Rebus. Would have given a  higher rating if not for the overly sweet sauce. Wish they can reduce by 30% of their sugar level.
1 of the best hawker stall for nasi ambeng & mee soto. affordable and superb tasting dishes. a must to go stall when in Marsiling market.
"Sitting in front of the store for 30mins, notice that both madams serve without masks on."
"Rice a lot but dishes like vegs & asam pedas gravy to little, not enough, end up eat plain rice."
Great Malay food!
Great food
"Ordered the minced pork noodles dry version, the noodles were on the softer side so if you like it al dente, you need to mention to them you prefer hard noodles. The noodles were evenly coated with Chilli (quite spicy!) and vinegar. There's even a huge slice of msuhroom and 2 pieces of liver (cooked perfectly, I usually dont eat but I could stomach both pieces and actually wanted more).

I think they added a bit of ketchup because it tasted a little sweet with every bite. Overall, well balanced and I will order again. The waiting time is about 5-8 minutes per bowl, so you can expect the estimated waiting time if you are queuing for this local delight.

I saw that they also sell fish soup, will try it next time!"
"One of my all-time favourite fish ball noodles stall. You can't go wrong with their Bak Chor Kway Teow Mee dry version.

The other thing that impresses me the most is how the person taking the orders can remember who ordered what. It was the case when it was manned by the younger boy. Now it's the same for the auntie who took over. Actually, it's to the point that she remembers my preferred noodle version whenever she sees me. And I don't really frequent the stall that often."
"stall closed from 09/06/25 monday to
19/06/25 thursday opened on 20/06/25 friday 

One of The Legendary Stall of My Favourite "
I've been eating from this stall for the past 40+ years. Thou I've moved to CCK. I still come here to eat once every week when I visit my mother. Their noodle got the traditional taste that's the same. The son took over from his mother but continues to serve the same old taste. Loves it.
"I bought a mee pok from this outlet first time, the medium one cost me $6 and I asked to add mushroom and the lady whom is taking the order told me total $8 and I said huh ok nvm I just pay $6 and she said I give you for $1 and before I agree she told the cook aunty ok and I paid $7 but since I wanted to eat. I ask for soup it seems like a big hassle from the att I notice and then she pass me the food.

I notice no chill or cutlery well some places self service and when I took 2 small red cut packet chill the serving lady rush over and snatch one pack and if this was a lady she would have should becoz her nails scratch my skin!!! Then she told me you cannot take you want go take the self service and i can only give you 1 packet... I was thinking it was take away what els will I do as I am not consuming the food there???  By right she should given chilly for take away ... So dame rude and even the cook lady said nvm just give mentioning boss bla bla in Chinese but she seems not to care and I went over to the cook aunty reported politely to her about the lady att but she do not understand English and I walk away not coming back to such rubbish attitude place just for chilly which cost is $0 or only $0.05 cents want to act childish.

Omg how in the world this ppl are ready to lose customer compare what I spend $7!!! At first attempt she try to scam me $2 for mushroom... what Lelong ah can anyhow sell so expensive and also just for a small chilly packet which they already pack for take away why pack to standby, everything self service la bodoh! Lost the mood to eat ... Probably the boss must have done such silly thing and the worker follow! Bane this place forever!!! The food is average and mushroom I paid which I got was a scam! Better eat elsewhere I spend $4-$5 on a good food and support shop whom respect and treat customers with respect!"
Old school flavorsome bowl of fishball bcm.
"The chef uncle really whips up a superb bowl of fishball noodles. The fishball in particular is also soft, chewy and tasty.

But these are all marred by the lady attendant. She cannot get simple orders right, yet insists on rushing to take em, and uninterested to acknowledge our requests (dry, no pork). This is just after she got another patron's order wrong. In the end, the dish is off - a waste of customers time and money.

In contrast to the young gentleman when he helms the ordering - calm, systematic, on point - then the kitchen can deliver some magic. Looking forward to improvements."
The fish soup know teow tng is nice. The fish balls are tangy and at $3.50 per bowl is very reasonable.
"Great bak chor mee! Noodles were savoury, and the texture was just right!"
Noodle was cooked very quickly because there was two cooks. You can add extra vinegar on your own. The mushroom was big and juicy. $6. Ordered the minced meat noodles.
"I think this is the best fish ball noodles in the East in my opinion. The ingredients are fresh and generous portion.
The lady boss is very friendly and smiley.
I will usually go for the no 4 option which comes with the mushroom which is very tasty too."
Sooo good ! Perfect balance of protein to noodles .. & the slight kick of chili ! Very addictive!
"Mee pok is al dente springy, fish balls qq and fresh, pork and liver fresh and tender, mushroom is perhaps too big and preferred thinner slices. Overall very good bowl of mee pok."
"Check out ig: @oyinshii

Best fish soup ever.

Who knew a bcm store (bak chor mee) would be able to serve up quality and fresh fish soup like this? I am someone who is quite resistant to boiled fish as I find them often to be quite pungent and I don't like the texture of overcooked fish. But this place has got it all figured out - the fish was tender and falls into pieces upon one bite, soup was extremely flavorful (without reliance of milk) and best of all, their noodles complements the soup extremely well!

Beware of the long snaking queue because people who knows about this place, knows how good it is! There will be a slight wait during peak lunch hours but I would say just suck it up and queue for it man. It's too good to miss!"
"Their kway teoh with fish slices($6) is very nice. Kway teoh is smooth. Soup base is light with a bit of sweetness, nice after taste. Fish slices is fresh, tender, less salty and thick. Portion is slightly big. 9/10"
The fishball noodles are quite nice. Mee pok and mee kia both springy. Mushrooms are juicy. Fish balls are fresh. Good for a quick fix if you live around the area. CDC vouchers accepted here.
"Service level is bad... went at 4:30pm and we were the only customer at that time,

They mixed up the orders, and instead of apologise, the 2 ladies at the stall still went ahead to make a joke out of it,

That's ""Service"" on a ""truly Divine Level"", that it would have deserved 0 stars.

Food is extremely overrated by the way. Taste is average at best. There are lots of other much better BCM stalls elsewhere, don't waste your time on this stall."
There are 2 ladies who usually takes orders and stands in front of the stall. The older one is ok but the younger one has the worst attitude; grumpy and ready to snap anytime. Noodles are very average. I didn't even realize until today that there are other noodle stalls in the row behind. I'd be trying those from now on instead. Not the sort who'd give business to those who think they are owed a living. You get what you give.
"Situated at marine terrace food centre. It is one of the best bcm around to me. Usually crowded on saturday morning, but they are very systematic and organised and fast to serve your order. The portion is quite huge for one person. I normally cannot finish all the noodles. Noodles are tasty, but don't leave a thirsty feeling after the meal.  Highly recommend."
"food is good, cooking time - chef really takes his own sweet time - well I guess if you want good cooked food, you'll have to wait"
Traditional n to my taste
Nice but expensive $5 for small one
"My go-to meal whenever I'm in that area is the delicious soup from this place. It's consistently amazing, with a rich, flavorful broth that doesn't leave me feeling parched afterward, which is a huge plus. The soup strikes a perfect balance--full of depth and complexity without being overly salty or heavy. Alongside the soup, the fish is always impressively fresh and thick, providing a satisfying and substantial bite. The quality of the fish is evident, making each bite worth every penny spent. The overall experience is one of genuine satisfaction and delight, and I can confidently say that I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a comforting and high-quality meal. Whether you're a local or just passing through, this spot is definitely worth a visit for its outstanding food and excellent value."
The male boss is the most sarcastic stall owner I have ever come across. Zero service attitude.
Recommended. Nice fish ball noodle  traditionally made.
Ordered the kway tiao soup. Ordinary taste and meat was marinated with too much pepper.
Fish soup with rice is nice
"Visited 02/08/2024 Sunny Friday Afternoon. The following sharing are based on our unbiased personal opinion and experience

Once a friend brought me here to try and told me this is the best. Many years down the road I agreed with him!  If not the best definitely one of the better wan around.

Ordered a $5 Mee pok waited up a bit and was served with a bowl of piping hot BCM topper with slice pork, pork lard, fish cake and beanspouts. The noodle was cooked just right and taste.

The fishball was the right texture and bouncy to the bite. Overall this bowl of noodle hits my heart .

Nice fishball noodles. Can't complain. . Popular with residents living around the area.  Ie may have queue. But it moves quite fast.
"Chanced upon this stall today. Didn't know there was a takeaway queue and dine in queue till I was told by the lady taking my order. Next, I was gestured by the same lady to stand aside. Then, I was told loudly that I was blocking the way of the take away queue. Seriously, she could have told me nicely with respect. The service of the lady can further improved. Anyway, i only had one order of fish ball soup which tasted so-so. Will be my last time buying from this stall."
Still Good. Travelling all e way from Tiong Bahru... Keep it Up
"My go-to Fishball Noodles whenever i'm craving them.
I like how the 'dry chilli' version is not overly oily, and their house-made sauce is super palatable.

Highly recommend getting it dry with Mee Tai Mak and Chilli Padi on the side."
"Had been patronising them since 20+ years ago, but the food is no longer cooked by the boss, they were cooked by the staff whom had followed him for 20+ years too. The minced meat used to be more pepperish but now it no longer had the pepperish taste.

I ordered minced meat dongfen with addon fish that cost $10 a bowl. Expensive for a hawker but its a bowl with lots of protein. I find the portion is justifiable, fish, liver and meat were cooked just nice, not overcooked. Overall I think its still ok, though it is not as good as before. I would give 3/5."
This is one of those food stall that I knew existed for the longest time (more than 20 years) but I decided to give it a try while in the vicinity. I am quite picky when it comes to fishball noodle - al dente noodle and tender and crunchy fishball. This one satisfies both. I will be back.
Good indeed
"Food is ok but find it a bit expensive, $6, a bowl for a hawker centre. Think the most expensive in that centre.
Used to be $5."
Fish ball Noodle Soup is good.
"Always tasty.  Been eating here for decades.  What I like is the sauce, with some lard and onion oil.

Ingredients are generous, with fish cake, fish balls, soft and well cooked pork slices and minced pork.  The mee pok and mee Kia has strong alkali taste, so I usually order the bee tai mak (rat's tail) or kway teow mee which absorbs the sauce very well.

If you eat there, will come with tasty soup.

Very long lines, but service is super fast, efficient as the order takers are well organized res always 2 people at the back cooking."
"My absolute favorite fishball minced meat kway teow. So tasty even if I order plain (Bai de) with no vinegar nor ketchup. Kway teow is smooth with good portion of sliced and minced meat and liver, with fishballs, 1 meatball and braised mushrooms (I usually order smallest size)."
"I ordered the smallest no. 4 ""Fish Ball Minced Meat Noodle Dry"" with chilli. It came with a bowl of soup (not pictured) that was quite nice and tasted Xian Tian haha sorry not sure what the English equivalent of that word is. Uncle taking orders at the counter was nice and friendly :)

Omg it was soooo good. Honestly because it's such a neighbourhood place, I wasn't expecting that much but I was totally blown away?!?!

Almost every component was seriously well done. The noodles were firm and springy, and coated in a delicious sauce blend with lard + lard oil, soy sauce, a very yummy chilli that's just the right spice level for most Singaporeans and I guess some secret special ingredient cos it's an UMAMI BOMB. There's no vinegar added but I didn't find myself missing it (and I'm a Tai Hwa fan!). The minced pork was some of the best I've ever had in BCM-the marination on it was a happy surprise since normally BCM minced pork tastes quite standard. Sliced pork and liver were well-cooked and tender. The fish ball was really bouncy, tasted great and not fishy at all (I'm quite picky when it comes to fish balls cos I'm sensitive to the smell). The meat ball tasted kinda normal but there's tee poh inside which was nice. Mysteriously I also got a sotong ball in place of the fish ball I've seen in other reviews."
Best fishball meesua in SG! Really good.
one of the best fishball noodles in the world!
"The stall to go to when you need recharge,  after just recovery from illness.  Dieheart stall to patronised.  Though place is far from where we stay,  it is worth the drive to fill our yearning. I liked the way the cook the yellow noodle,  not too overcooked,  just nice to texture.  Fishballs was very fresh too. Price has gone up to $5 per bowl. Still worth it with the portion given."
One of the best fishball noodles. Fishball not fishy and springy. Sauce and chilli is delicious with the noodle.
"Really rare that what you see on the signboard and what you see in your bowl are the same!
Sure prices have increased over the years but I'm glad there's no shrinkflation seen here yet.
Also no takeaway charge so I was quite surprised"
Delicious bowl of noodles. Chilli packs a punch
Soups is like salt water. Overrated.
"it was too delicious that i finish before i could take photo. the taste of old school. the taste of growing up in singapore in the 70s and 80s the awesome traditional chilli, the pork lard that is used to dish up the dried mee pok is super crispy and crafted. the water like soup pack a punch filled w awesome taste and savoury sweetness. fish ball fish cake meat ball all top notch..very organized outfit by the owners who dishes the food to the hungry crowd thank you for the amazing dried meepok that has also home cook thoroughly braised mushroom that melts in the mouth."
One of my favourite places in Singapore for great Bak chor Mee since childhood
Ordered the smallest portion of fishball bee tai mak (ketchup) and bak chor mee (chili). However the serving is still chock full of ingredients. Liver in the bcm is super tender and the noodles are seasoned well with spicy sambal. I love the bee tai mak that is smooth and tangy from the ketchup. The lard pieces in both bowls are amazingly crunchy and aromatic. No wonder there's always a queue at this stall.
"Best mee tai mak / mee pok in this area, chilli is good. Fish soup is also good. Been eating for years. Price recently increased tho"
"Decent bowl of bee tai mak, and the accompanying soup was very sweet. Would come back again!"
"Our family's favourite comfort food. Fresh fish, flavourful soup. Queue can get long but the young chap is super efficient and organised."
"Order Mee Pok dry $5. Option if adding ketchup (red) or soya sauce (black)

Ordered the black version. Smell of the sauce is fragrant. A decent bowl of noodles if you are in the area."
Stall keeps increasing price ridiculously from $3.50 to $5 for a bowl of dry fishball noodles without a single prawn and not even a bean sprout over a short period of time!
Amazing food
"Mee pok dry with chilli, $6 portion here with extra noodles.
I would honestly say it's one of the best BCM I've tried. Slightly costly for a bowl of BCM meal but the flavours and quality of the ingredients in this bowl made it worthwhile.
Compared to Tai Wah BCM franchise, this is definitely more consistent flavour wise and worthwhile with the ingredients served.

Noodles are al dente, chilli is fragrant, liver is cooked just right, sliced and minced pork are fresh and tasty. Plus one thick mushroom well braised and served whole. Nothing fancy about the meat balls, I should try their fishballs next round.
Vinegar is not added into the sauce mix when served but they do provide it as a side if you ask.

The accompanying clear soup is deceptive yum! Finished every drop of this soup. If they use the same soup for their fish soup dishes, then those would make for a tasty meal too.

Slightly costly but worth a return visit.
Cashless payment available."
"one of, if not the best, dry BCM. fast service too."
"I come here to satisfy my mee tai mak cravings ever since I was introduced to this place by my Dad when I was a kid. My go-to dish, ""dry, white mee tai mak"", is a dish that relies heavily on light soy-sauce-like seasoning and pork lard for fragrance and taste. The carbohydrates (noodles/ mee tai mak) are cooked al dente and retain an addictive bounciness. A bowl of soup is provided for dry noodle dishes that has fishballs, fishcake, minced pork, and fish dumplings (common ingredients to pair with Singaporean hawker stall noodles). Their crispy deep-fried pork lard ""cubes"" are fresh, oily, and very satisfying (you might not get these if you don't ask).

While not the healthiest dish, ""dry, white mee tai mak with added crispy deep-fried pork lard"" is a no-frills comfort dish to me.

This stall has been passed from the father to the son and still sees to a healthy crowd. The cook matters by the way: there were times in the past when cooking was delegated to a stall hand. During these periods, quality suffered.

Ambience: No-frills, typical hawker centre ambience.

Ask for the deep-fried crispy pork lard! (in chinese this is called ""zhu you zar"") Minor note: not everyone likes deep-fried crispy pork lard though!"
"Sometimes they get the order wrong, other than that it is good.

Soup isn't too thick, accept different cashless payments."
Price too expensive. Only stall selling fish ball mee in the hawkers center
"Like their mee pok dry black sauce.
Often dapau for breakfast "
this is a clearly a very popular store but I can understand everyone's enthusiasm about this bcm/ fish ball noodles/ btm.
"Very popular fish soup stall in the neighbourhood. Nice clear soup with fresh premium batang fish - good choice for a healthy meal. Their minced meat noodles are also very tasty with lots of ingredients mixing well together.

They're closed every Thursday. Open till quite late around 8pm plus."
Long queue but clear very fast because they have a production like operation. The Mee Pok dry with chillies is very flavourful and quite generous with ingredients. Soup has minced meat and old school childhood taste.
"This doesn't disappoint. Still one of my fav fishball noodles. The chilli is on point, fishballs bouncy, noodles perfectly cooked. Ordered the $4 portion"
It was good the fishball
Very qq noodles and flavourful! Come at 10am to avoid the crowd!
Enjoyed the medium bak chor mee ($6).The liver was just the right doneness. Meatballs were nice and firm. Soup was good. Mee pok was fine. Mushrooms were good. Didn't have tee po or vinegar flavour though.
One of the tasty minced meat fish ball noodles at the East. The fish soup also nice with smooth fish slices.
"One of my favourite minced meat noodles stall that I have frequent for many years. Ingredients is fresh and generous. Queue is long during peak hours, but move fast."
Noodles tastes OK. But fishballs were mediocre and the meatball seemed to have been boiled too long and lacked taste.
Quite expensive at Hawker price. Prefer try others rather than eat in the same place.
"I finally understand why there is a perpetual queue here because their food is really flavourful. And at $5 for the smallest bowl of Minced Meat Meepok, it is properly loaded with ""liao"" of sliced pork and pig's liver (note: although not as pink and barely-cooked as other places, the liver is still very tender), three bouncy meatballs and braised mushrooms. The noodles are evenly tossed in a nicely balanced sauce.
Verdict: Worth queuing for because the line moves quickly."
"The guy taking your order is amazing. You can rattle off a complicated order as fast as you want and he will take it down to a tee. Fishball noodles without fishballs, add fishcake and sliced pork, mix mee tai mak and kway teow? No problem. And he remembers your ""pattern"" after awhile, if you are a regular customer.

The noodles are also pretty awesome, my regular go-to for lunch during and after Circuit Breaker. There's a reason why there is a queue but they are fast and hardworking, so you'll get your food within 15 minutes."
"Several stalls selling nice and reasonbly priced food... Like the fish ball noodles stall, Hor fun stall, Thai food and Char Kuey Teow stall etc All these 4 open till 8,9 pm... (sorry did not take any photos)"
My regular stall to go for noodles.
Cheap and nice!
So so only. But pricing consider expensive.
"This is really good. Queue is pretty long I heard but I got mine at the moment the queue was still ok. Sunday 8+. But I saw lots of tapao waiting. I would say it's better than the katong jago and Jalan tua kong one in terms of flavour, amount of ingredients and the price."
"The mee pok dry comes in small, middle and large sizes, priced at $4,$5 & $6 respectively. For the $5 version, there are 4 fishballs and two slices of fish cake. Portion is enough for a hungry adult.
The looks is plain but the noodle is smooth. Fishballs are fresh and bouncy.
On account of freshness, it is a good lunch meal."
One of the best fishball noodles I had. Great place to for a quick bite at a reasonable price.
"One of the most famous fishball noddles you can find. At $4, they give a generous amount of ingredients and noodles. Service is fast even with a long queue."
Kids love this. Queue always present.
"The fishball is fresh and on the soft side. Would be perfect if it's a little firmer, however their porkball is tasty and firm. They also come with fish roll and fish meat slices which is nice. The soup very clear and tasty, typical teochew style. I didn't have the noodle."
This stall is one of the few remaining pioneer stalls at the hawker centre. They have maintained the taste factor over the decades and has their own fan base comprising of regulars near and far. Have tried fish ball noodles from many places but this is by far one of my favourites.
Love the noodles over there. You can have it dry or with soup and a variety of noodles to choose from
Standard has not drop and staff really nice. Double thumbs up.
Best minced meat noodles in Singapore. I would love to be proven wrong.
Wasted my calories on the bar chor mee. Fishball is floury not springy.  Noodles became one clump immediately when I reach my seat
"One of my favourite fish soup and dry meetaimak stall in Singapore.

Fish soup is consistently good, fish is fresh. Mee tai mak is beautifully chewy and packed with flavour from the oil and chilli!

Highly recommend people to try this place out."
Huan Bu Cuo
"I would give this place 6 stars if I could. Grew up in Marine Parade and been coming here for many years, still the best BCM in sg in my opinion. I personally love the dry mee tai mak!"
Not the best but it is an above average bak chor mee with a fast service. The queue cannot be really seen because you will need to wait in the other side after your order and payment.
Best Mee Pok stall ever. Can't find any other stall that serves mee pok anywhere else.
"There are very limited stalls at this Marine Terrace food centre. Packed my breakfast from this particular stall that sells fishball noodle and fish soup.

Noodle starts from SGD$4 onwards,  To be honest, its a little pricy. I ordered the SGD$5 portion fearing the small portion might not be enough. Portion was just right. Noodle was nicely cooked and sauce was goes well with the noodle. My bowl of noodle comes with fish dumpling,fishball,minced and sliced pork."
"Not the cheapest, fish soup and a plain noodle $7 but quite generous with the serving. Soup is in the blend side but still not bad. Fish is a hot and miss. Some are very salty and some are tasteless. Non tasted sweet. Just a tad little fishy with skin on.  Was told the fishballs noodles were good. $4 with plenty of ingredients. Easily the longest queue in the center. Tip: they accept cashless payment."
"#2 is nice, if noodle can be softer will be perfect."
The foods is nice..
"Food was nice, but service is so so...."
One of the hidden gems in Marine Parade
One of the better fish ball noodles in this area.
Very good food.
Good and cheap
Prefer the noodle shop directly behind this stall. This stall has rude staff that show preference for 'regulars' and the portions are inconsistent. Taste wise. Almost the same as the shop directly behind.
Consistently good! Because I've been eating this for 20 years.
"This is without a doubt the best fish porridge in Singapore. I've been eating here for the past 15 years, never failed once. Highly recommended."
"A heartland hawker stall that serves up a tasty bowl of traditional fish ball or mince meat noodles.

A great place to get your noodles fix and at hawker center prices.

Ask them for the $7 not on the menu portion and you get a portion with lots of goodies that will satisfy 2 light eaters."
"Famous stall in Marine Terrace. Noodle is well blended with the sauce and meat.
Operating hours: 6:30am - 8:30pm
Closed on Thursday"
Good for hunger
Fish texture is great but there is a fishy smell with the skin on. Stall is famous with awards for its fishball noodles.
"Very affordable zhe char dishes from Sheng Xiang Kitchen that kept us coming back for more. Steamed fermented fishhead, steamed minced pork with salted fish and their greens are lovely dishes to order. Highly recommended."
"I decided to venture out of the usual stalls I patronise to give this a try - and I am truly wowed by the food. There are a number of stalls here well known for their steamed fish, but this one is slightly different in that they have fried fish - something that I like. The deep fried grouper and soon hock are amazingly delicious, so is the mapo beancurd, and spicy popcorn chicken. I am sure I will be back here many times."
Disappointing ordering experience.
"This is a place that I have visited a few times now, and on no occasion that we were disappointed.  Except for the day that they ran out of pipe fish Jian Zui Yu   which I highly recommended.   Stir fried spinach  Di Huang Miao is a must.  All of the dishes from the small menu are good.   The service staff are very obliging.
**Jan 2025 update - the shop has stopped serving pipe fish because of the inconsistency in supply.  The deep-fried grouper is very nice, must try."
"The freshest fish head you can probably find. I absolutely loved the generous portions and masterful seasoning. Always come back here for the fish head!

Note it might take awhile because of the crowd but its so worth it"
From a tiny 8'x8' kitchen that chuns out impressive Zhi-Char fares that taste as good as they look. Good portions at affordable prices.
Excellent bean sauce fish. So fresh and flavorful. Shiok with rice. Veggies with garlic nicely fried but quality can be better. Some leaves are already spoilt.
Yummy and economical
Super duper reasonable pricing with 5 stars quality (steam fish head) and other great dishes. Must try. Wont regret it
Nice place to take ur best meal in the town.. The chef very expert and good mostly highly recommend.. And off course.. The price is very reasonable...
"Disappointing taste. Overall salty, oily"
Their Di Huang Miao was really flavorful with a great texture. The portions are really generous and the laoban manning the stall is extremely nice.
We like the fried grouper which costs a reasonable $23 for medium size. The sambal potato leaves and steamed chicken with mushrooms are tasty too.
Really value for money. The food is great  and would not disappoint you.
"Tried today as per recommendation , satisfied food and good altitude , will go again !"
"Came to Dumman food centre for dinner but many stalls including our usual go to stall was closed. We decided to give this stall a try instead. They are located on the same row as the famous rojak stall. This stalls serves both local and china dishes.

Since it was our first time here, decided to go with the recommendation of the la zi ji, stir fried you mai with garlic and their salted fish steam pork patty. Since there wasnt any crowd, we didnt had to wait long before our food was ready. La zi ji was crispy and wasnt too spicy or numbing. Stir fried you mai was pretty good. The most impressive dish for me was the steam pork patty, it was well seasoned and the meat was overcooked.

Overall, food was pretty good. would recommend to try if you are here and not sure what to eat. We would definitely be back again to try their other dishes in the future."
Always here for the black bean sauce fish head.
"Back again specially for their black bean sauce fish head. The gravy goes very well with white plain rice. Highly recommended!

Spicy dice chicken (La Zi Ji) is great too, the numb feels so decently good.

You Mai Cai is good too!

Store owner is very friendly and always willing to comply to my request of having more pork lard for the bean paste fish head.

Price wise is reasonable."
"Tried the different styles of fish here, bean paste ones were nice! Dishes are more towards china style. Have to go on the days they get the ingredients to get the fresh ones (ask the boss, changes every now and then)."
"My mother and I wanted to try their crispy fried fish but they were not in stock. We had steamed garoupa and stir-fry potato leaves instead. The fish is very very fresh and vegetables were not oily like what usually we get at other cze char store. Prices are reasonable.
Will be back soon to try other dishes!"
"The rating is based on a dish that I tried known as La Zi Ji (La Zi Ji). This is a sichuan dish made up of small bite size pieces of crispy chicken and stirred fried with aromatics such as dried chili, ginger, garlic and sichuan peppercorns that gives off the numbing effect known as Hua Jiao. The dish is very well executed in terms of the generous crispy chicken pieces. However, compared to the better ones that I have had, the dish needs to use more sichuan peppercorns for aroma, add fried peanuts and use more dried chili. The aromatic effect is weak compared to the best I've had. Overall, it's still a well executed dish but not quite the 5 star level yet. Do note that La Zi Ji is an expensive dish, as sichuan peppercorns and dried chili are not cheap, and they need to be used liberally to achieve the Ma Xiang effect."
Very generous portion of fish head. Love it 
"Its a sleepy stall and I've only had their La zi ji($10) before. Slightly on the pricier side, but oh my.. best la zi ji I've tried. Spicy yet not blindy numbing, its a good balance of spices."
Fresh hongkong steamed fish head.  $15 for this half price of fish head.  I guess is not expensive.  Very well cooked.  Will come back to try other dishes.

"If you're here for smiles and customer service, don't bother coming. Stay far away.

But if you're here for their good food, you won't be disappointed! One of the better pork leg rice I've ever eaten."
"I've never felt so cheated in my life. There was a miscommunication between the menu and the customer's perspective, and unfortunately, I paid a disgruntling price for it.

I ordered a pork leg, and it literally came with only bones and skin for $9.50--without any meat. I'd like question the person who created this menu, will he/she pay $9.50 for just skin and fat, without any meat. Have they ever eaten it themselves. It's ridiculous.

I had it at chai chee business park"
One of the better Braised Pork Trotters Rice around with a few branches island wide. Worth a try!
"Don't bother going to the store after 2pm, store is almost guaranteed to have 0 staffs around. Been here almost every day as I'm around here for lunch almost everyday. Save yourself the frustration and go for the chicken rice just beside here. Shi Nian don't need your business nor money "
"Honestly, the two guys at the stalls are not as bad as they say in the review section lol. They were polite and just like any hawker owners.

Food was good, love the prawncake!!! And chilli hahahahah"
"Worst service. Foreign worker served me the food. No tact, no courtesy and check out the vegetables dangling by the bowl. Pls avoid"
"pork leg is slow-cooked to perfection, resulting in tender, flavorful meat with a rich, savory sauce.
friendly and attentive staff to serve all your needs."
Overall a good meal but think Shi Nian can improve more
"Staff attitude really bad. Allowing other people to cut the queue to order the food. I ordered $22 a lean meat from the photo basically a very thin layer of meat (sorry not all lean meat but majority are fat skin and the meat more look like pierce by pierce made up from left over meat) . When I ask for a bowl, as I order big portion from the store, the staff reply unhappily we never give extra plate.."
"Received really bad service from this stall. The 2 male staffs who managed the stall was really rude and bad attitude.  Its was a dinner hour, both of the staffs decided to went for their smoke break together and left the stall unattended with customers queuing. Pls see the picture we taken  as evidence. Strongly suggest to stop patronise this stall unless the service improve. After tis visit,  im very sure it will be the last. If these 2 are the owner of the stalls, good luck to them. If they are the staffs, hope the owner can assist to improve them."
"- the person who handle this stall, please attend customer service course.
- close the stall if you are unhappy.
- best is both person can leave the stall empty to go smoke at dinner time."
Pig leg rice was good! Highly recommended.
"Love the taste, i will come back"
Honestly the braise is good and the meats are tender BUT the attitude of the hawker ruined everything. I asked nicely if I would pay by Grab and he was like NO as if I owed him a living.
"Yummy pig trotter rice bowl.
Surprised not just by the taste and looks of the trotter (knuckles) but also the rice - doesn't tastes like cheap rice and it works so well with the fragrant sauce. Topping that is that the bowl offers a bite of the prawn cake that taste prawn-y and homemade and good salted vegetables ."
Horrible service
"Saw this newly opened pig rice stall at 84 Marine Parade Hawker Centre. Previously, this stall was occupied by the legendary Apollo CKT shut down earlier this year.

Shi Nian offers pig trotter rice, pig leg rice and intestines. Chose the Pig Leg rice, as the trotters seemed quite fatty.

What is so distinct is how soft the meat is - it just falls apart with soft nudges. The sauce is well absorbed the braised meat. Got a large chunk of prawn cake along with my rice too.

At $5.9, the quantity is decent."
The pork leg and braised intestines is good. Some part of the pork leg lean meat is slightly tough but overall good and nicely flavoured. However let down by the poor service and attitude of the staff. Although this is an hawker stall and normally service is not expected but the service guy was impolite and condescending. At least I don't see this attitude in any other stalls.
Tried their big intestine and prawn cake. The intestine was well braised infused with soya flavour abit oily thou. The prawn cake was nice but too much of the sauce actually overpower the main dish and sweet. Will be back for the lean meat or pig leg rice next round.
"Pork trotter rice is really good, flavourful and the sweet sour chilli goes perfectly well with it. Portion is rather small though, finished it in just a few minutes. Also barely needed to chew because it's mostly soft meat and fats,"
"SHIOK! Seriously enjoyed this bowl of rich goodness! You can either choose the pork leg rice or the pork trotter rice. The latter doesn't come with lean meat, so I ordered the former.

The pork leg rice is served with salted vegetables and a slice of prawn fishcake as sides. The main highlight was the good mix of slices of lean and fat, collaenic pork leg (meat and skin included). Each slice was tender, fragrant and with a melt-in-your-mouth texture! So good! The gravy was slightly herbal but not overpowering nor salty/oily. Oh oh! And their chilli is fresh and addictive! Goes very well with the dish.

Wish it would come with a soup or an egg. Haha! But overall, I'll be back again.

They also offer braised intestines, which I hope to try next time.

Do come support!"
"Staff were friendly. Pork feet and trotters are different from the amount of collagen in the trotters. Lightly flavored, sticky sauce (collagen yo!).
Prawn cake a little too normal for that price. Other than that, it's lit! Delicious."
"Had thid for dinner on Wednesday night and it was good! Almost as good as my grandma's version! Tender meat, sauce is collagenous and the chili goes so well with the whole bowl. Not quite sure what the piece on top left is but it was nice! Only downside is price is a bit pricey for a small portion, like my husband will not be full with 1 bowl. Actually i am also nor very full. Spent $5.90 for a bowl of Zhu Jiao Fan"
Food is overpriced
"gooey, tender pig leg rice bussin frfr"
"Craving for braised pork leg rice? This is a must try stall. Pricing starting from $5.90, you get a small bowl of soft puffy rice topped with slices of braised pork leg, salted vegetables, and one slices of prawn paste fish cake. The braised sauce is on the light & slightly gluey side which goes well with the white rice. Braised pork is soft and tender a good mix of fat & lean pork. The chilli is slightly garlicky but no over powering. Good till the last rice grain.
Prepare to queue during meal peak hours, but it is worth the wait. Big eater might consider ordering two bowls instead of one."
Authentic flavour. Must try.
"This Ter-Kah-Png (Pig Leg Rice) is damn shiok. Meat so tender, succulent, fragrant and the cuts are generous with a good mix of fatty meats and some preserved veggies too. Chilli also damn shiok! The one sample piece of Prawn Cake is really a teaser that'll make me order more next time. Wished it came with a small bowl of soup though. Overall damn solid and a nice welcome to this neighborhood."
"Oh gosh! The soup packs a punch and a fantastic supplement to the seafood! The seafood must have been very well handled and stored because there is no hint of decay, and a lovely hearty meal all around!"
"i like the soup! as far as i can tell the fish and seafood taste fresh. the texture is also firm and not rubbery, so i think it's cooked well. the meatballs are also very big, think overall it's worth it since they're generous with ingredients."
"Decent bowl of Seafood Soup, plus point is the fact that this type is so rare to find nowadays  soup tastes good, liao is quite generous I feel"
Eat there got prawns if take away no prawn same price + take away charge.
"Bug portion.. authentic seafood soup taste.. stall owner was kind and helpful to bring over our orders when we ordered abit too much.. best is the $6.50 braised duck addition.. value for money volume!!

Located in a not so accessible area, but i will definitely come back again

Thanks"
"I've heard that Marsiling and Woodlands both have amazing seafood soup, and I wasn't disappointed with what was presented before me.

I'm no food expert, just a layman who enjoys yummy food, and this bowl of seafood soup (with crayfish and fresh fish slices and minced meat) was all so fresh and sweet tasting, not too overwhelming for my taste buds, quite a balanced one, which I did enjoy!

Aunty was really nice and friendly and recommended me which version of the seafood soup to get as it was my first time! Overall, I enjoyed it very much and I'd definitely return and have it again if I'm in the area!"
"Tried their batang fish slices with thin bee hoon small size ($7++). Batang fish slices are big portion, thick, juicy and tender. Minced meat also big portion. Soup base is slightly thick with sour taste from tomato. 9.2/10"
Happened to come across this store in Marsiling. Was a decent meal. Felt the soup could have been richer.
Wanted to eat at the hawker centres unfortunately most stalls were closed. Hence chance upon this stall that sell the same seafood soup. Taste was good but broth wasn't as rich and flavourful compared to SK from the hawker stall. For a bowl at $8.50 with rice which is the smallest bowl it can only filled up one person appetite.
Honestly not worth the trip down here to have this. Soup is bland and porky. Don't have a thing for porky soup. Rice is old and not nice. Fish is passable.
"Excellent fish and seafood soup, very fresh, tasty and good service, Kor"
"Fish was fresh and abundance in quantity. Soup was thick and flavorful. Not to forget, the chilli was great too. Definitely worth a visit!"
Comforting bowl of batang soup at a reasonable price!
super good
"The seafood soup here is very good, highly recommended!"
Very nice! So flavourful!
Good food with friendly stall owner
Seafood soup is flavourful and fresh
Amazing food & service...extremely friendly
"Ordered batam seafood soup. I would have given it 2 stars if not for the sesame soya sauce. No idea why but the soup seems overly salty. I don't get that seafood freshness. The prawn is so difficult to peel like not fresh like that but somehow still tasty. Fish and mince meat are nothing to write home about.

The sesame soya sauce is the thing that elevated the taste, makes everything more delicious... But the soup why soooo salty =("
"Comforting, warm and a flavourful broth. V generous amount of meat too. Friendly seller as well! Will continue to patronise this place!"
Soup/seafood was delicious and portion is good for 2 honestly. Will visit again to try other soups.

"Lovely soup with batang fish, tasty meat cluster and great with Yi Mee 3 sizes to choose from."
"The two famous stores here are the seafood soup and Malaysian style Bak Kut Teh. Unfortunately, the standard for the seafood soup has dropped. It's not as rich as before. Not sure where you can find the rich soup version anymore in Singapore, you can try Malaysia instead."
"One of my favourite seafood soup, Fried fish is separately served which is incredibly crispy, prawns are big and fresh and soup is flavourful."
"Have tried this kind of seafood soup and few places where their soup are usually very intense and tasty. However the soup here is pretty mild, minced meat quite dry, noodle not cooked enough to soften.. but the good part is batang fish tasted fresh. This bowl cost $7.70."
"food was ok but getting more and more expensive. $7 for fish soup is ridiculous. fish was also not very fresh, especially for the price"
Decided to try their fish soup after awhile. Standard dropped alot. One bowl of batang fish soup is $7 now. Their batang fish tasted very fishy and not fresh. Soup is very diluted and blend. Not the same as last time anymore. Can't taste the fried flat fish now. Guess I will not come again.
"Soup is diluted and bland. Minced pork is tasteless. Definitely not worth the drive there. While the fish is fresh, the prawns were not sweet.  Personally it's not worth the 4.2 stars rating."
"Had the dory seafood soup medium and batang crayfish. The soup was very flavourful and the ingredients were fresh. Plus the owners are nice and gave additional soup and chilli upon request

2023 update:
I've been frequenting this shop (around once every 2 weeks) and the standard has remained excellent. The flavour of the meat is brought out in the soup and the sesame oil can be tasted in the soup.  It's my favourite stall serving this type of fish soup in SG. Prices are also cheaper than others. Highly recommend."
"Standard drop a lot a lot . Soup taste very bad now . Even the meat , "
"Liked the fish soup here, well cooked. The minced pork is well marinated. Been patronising here for many years."
A nice bowl of seafood soup. In my opinion is better than most out there just because the soup is rich is flavours and mincemeat and fish are fresh! Will try with prawns next round!
Can be better 
Gem of a find
So nice until want to cry. But a lot of pigeons at this coffee shop and the cleanliness not the best. In life you win some and lose some. With the quality food I'll still go back but maybe Dabao instead. The meatballs like got flat fish inside very fragant and yummy
"Had the fish soup and braised pork leg. Very nice soup and the portion was good, with lots of fish and minced pork."
"As someone who deeply enjoys this specific type of seafood soup, I must admit that I was rather skeptical when I first chanced upon Sin Kee.

Yes, I knew it was still rather famous, but it didn't seem too appetising when I went to the stall.

I paid a total of $8 for the $7.50 Mid-size Dory Seafood Soup ($6/7.5/9) + Rice ($0.50)

The seafood soup was cream and packed with Umami and seafood flavour while still being light and consequently not too surfeiting.

Generous portions of Dory Fish were given which were firm and seemed fresh. The minced meat was slightly lacking in terms of savouriness but was still acceptable.

Overall, great value for money."
"Great foods, good dining place for family."
"First time trying the seafood soup, bought the Batang fish version, the smell of lard is abit overwhelming for me  but it works if you are a fan. Overall tasty!"
Good deal......
Tasty fish soup
"Pao Shui De Xiao Di,Pao De Hen Bu Gan Yuan,Pao Cuo Shui Ni Gen Ta Jiang Pao Cuo Jiu Hen Bu Shuang Liao,Yi Ding Yao Jiang Shi Ni orderCuo,Lao Ban Qing Lai Yuan Gong Shi Da Ye. Hen Nan Ting Che"
Great tasting seafood soup as usual but it's pricey. For a medium bowl of batang fish and seafood mix with meatballs and soup with rice would set you back about $9.50 for a medium option. Flavourful soup with 3 big prawns and a lot of Batang fish slices and meatballs to go with..especially great tasting when it's the rainy season! But be prepared to sweat it out to wait for a space as its always full during lunch hours!
Their fried rice and noodles is the best
Value for monies. Very tasty.
Delicious soup top with fresh prawns and Batang fish slices. And the minced meats in the soup yummy.
"Standard has dropped, broth had lesser flavour than the hype."
"If you love fish, you'll love this place"
The Fish Seafood soup is good!! Highly recommend. Fish and soup was good. Ate many times 
The soup so tasteless . Prawn not fresh
Normal soup based. Ingredients are fresh.
"Very good flavour, fresh fish and prawn. Will come back."
"Sellers are very friendly. Tried the crayfish batang soup. The soup is so flavourful and tastety. The fish and crayfish are so tender and fresh. Paired with their homemade meatballs, really superb! Highly recommended."
"Wanted To Head Down For e Bak Kut Teh, However, e Queue Was Pretty Long & So We Decided To Take e Next Alternative  But... This Time Was A Little Disappointed w Their Standard Comparing w e 1st Time Am Down Prolly A Year Ago...  Not As Good As I Last Remembered~"
"The fish is fresh and yummy while the stock is super tasty.
Definitely I will come back for more of the fish soup"
"3 crayfish halves, chunks of dory fish, salted meatballs in flavourful broth. All $11.50. Yummy!"
Very generous portion of soup and ingredients!
Nice place to have dinner with my family.
"Reviewed 2 years ago - Awesome rich and flavourful seafood soup!!!

Latest update:
But not sure if it's the same stall or taken over by new owner.
The previous lady boss told me they have moved to coffeeshop @ 115 Aljunied Ave 2, #01-35. Now known as JiaLi Seafood Soup. Went once there to check out the place and for the seafood soup."
"Saw good reviews and came to try. Fish soup batang medium $8. With rice $8.50.
The soup is salty and lack dimension in flavour.
Won't come back again.
Felt v thirsty after meal."
"Was expecting the soup to be more flavourful. Stall is generous with ingredients, worth the price of $5.50"
"Still good, but personally prefer the stall in the market."
Standard dropped a lot.
Ordered medium size - 3 huge prawns with generous portion of minced pork + fish!! Seafood was fresh and soup doesn't even have a tinge of fishiness. Really yummy!
Recommended! The soup is tasty!
The soup is very flavourful and the ingredients used (prawn/crayfish/fish) are fresh. Definitely will come again next time. Thumbs up 
"Food was tasty and flavourful.
Lady boss was friendly.
Worth the wait for good food.
Will definitely come back again
Highly recommended if you pass by marshaling"
Tasty and flavourful. Like the minced meat balls with salted fish.
Yummy seafood food. Much cheaper than the famed yanji.
Good taste
New owners but they are friends of the former owner. Still a delicious bowl of fish and prawn soup when you are in the area.
"Wei Dao Zhen De Bu Cuo,Jiu Shi Zhong Wu Ren Tai Duo,Bu Hao Zhao Wei Zhi. "
"I have finally tried this stall. $6.50 for the small portion Batang fish. Taste of the soup and meat wise, are not aromatic enuff. In fact its pretty light taste to me. I have tried better ones....i will give 3.5stars for the food. However I still give 4 stars as the owners are friendly."
"$6.5 for batang fish slices, prawn (one big, one medium) and handful of minced pork. The soup is flavourful without being too strong or salty. The fish and prawn is fresh and texture is firm. Satisfying!"
Good seafood soup.  I like that crayfish with fish soup
"Food is mediocre. Can eat. But the staff I have been here twice, and twice I felt mocked at when I make my orders. I don't know if it's because of my looks or what but they make it VERY OBVIOUS especially the second time I was there. The two aunties were packing my food and one whispered to another, then both giggled.

I find this EXCEPTIONALLY RUDE and unnecessary. In service line, we respect all our customers regardless race, gender and looks! Will never patronise again and for all of you out there, don't risk yourself being placed in an uncomfortable situation when ordering food. Don't let this experience spoil your day."
"Roast delight serving Roast Pork, Roast Duck, Char Siew and Soy Sauce Chicken. The Roast Duck is good but the skin of the Roast Pork is a little hard. The chili is great."
"My hubby paid $6 for takeaway and they gave overnight roasted duck leg. Please don't patronize in the morning, in case they sell overnight food to you. Seen other review after I try to find this stall, so they sell overnight to other customers as well."
Rude staff. Will avoid this stall in the future
agree w many of the reviews that they do not seem to be very interested in doing business. very curt in their replies and not interested at all in your request for more gravy. stopped patronizing them.
Super salty and is the yesterday left over roasted meat
very rude staff
Been eating at this stall for awhile and service been consistently bad. They had RUDE STAFFs (aunty and this middle age dude has same terrible attitude) Food was ok only :) not worth to buy from this stall and probably will not buy here ever again unless all the stalls in adm hawker is closed and I have no choice 
"Staff very rude when asking customers. Shouting at customer when asking for options, does not like doing business and just looking quarrel. Better run away from this rubbish stall ! Never come again!"
"Tried the char siew and roasted meat noodles. Find the char siew more of a cooked meat and lacking unami, roast flavour and tough on the texture. Nothing stands out for the roasted meat. The sauce of the noodle was also so so."
"Good portion of meat, tried their Cahr Siew Noodle and added roasted pork, can see how generous their added side dish (roasted pork) for $1. The soup is nice and fresh as well. Could be better if they char siew is slight more juicy and roasted pork slightly warmer."
Staff is rude... is it that food is free of charge? Not recommended.
"Food is OK, but the 2 guy (staff) should attend customer service courses, although it is a hawker centre."
Give so little roast pork. That time I order the platter give alot roast pork one.. and put until so messy like dog food liddat
Nice and delicious food
"The Mee Goreng was extremely flavourful, pretty good deal for the price"
"Ordered white & black mixed, $5.80 (medium). Loved it at first bite, surprisingly the white is slightly better (usually black ones are more flavourful due to the sweet sauce). Definitely worth it. Fragrant and well cooked, not soggy and quiye crisp. They have quite abit of orders but wait times are fast, about 7-10mins. Recommended and coming back!"
Buy their carrot for white and black at $4.80 each is totally can say no use heart to cook. The black is very oily. White is totally tasteless.
Visited on vesak day afternoon and there was no queue. Ordered the $4.8 black and white carrot cake and the food took less than 10 mins to serve. Carrot cake was soft and more on the salty side. They are very generous with their eggs as well.
"Traditional food here that needs no introduction. My comfort food, always makes me happy.
The Black & White fried carrot cake is only $4.80, my personal favourite. Top with a cup of aromatic Traditional Coffee, it will just make your day. Perfect combination."
"My first and last time supporting this stingy stall.
Ordered $5 Mee goreng, no wok hei, weak taste, 2 small not so fresh prawns, a few fish cakes bits, can't see any sotong, probably ate a very short one.
Very different from the stall's picture where it shows 3 sotong rings and 3 prawns..."
"Ordered the small black carrot cake and char kway teow, tasted average. Maybe try the white version next time"
Wanted to eat fried kway teow. Found this stall. Not very good rating but anyway not much choice so give it a try. Wow! Surprised by the strong wok hey and good taste. Can eat!
"$4 portion was decent and filling for a meal. Not too sweet to my liking. For those who loves spicy, might want to ask for extra spicy."
Slightly above average hokkien mee and char kway teow. The white carrot cake is good.
"8.50 for oyster omelette. Although the egg was fried to crunchiness, the ratio of oyster to the egg/starch isn't justified."
"Not worth it, won't go back."
"Not the dry and crispy type.
Recommend if u like the soft dough type"
The half black half white carrot cake plate was delicious! Stills from a video
Less oily and less wokhey only can gave 4 stars instead. Looks very different from photos display.
"The pictures are attractive.
Very bland and the kueh was devoid of flavor.
Hardly any preserved turnip. A dash of fish or soy sauce would at least make a difference.
Forgettable"
"Crispy toasted omelette on top of the white carrot cake.
Slightly on the salty side, but I guess the cook added too much preserved radish into the mix."
"A pair of humble brother & sister team hawker at Marsiling Mart food center selling one of the best and crispy Fried carrot cake, a must try local delicacy when you come to north region. The neighboring coffee stall serves rich and aromatic local Kopi, great combo for late lunch or breakfast "
"Very nice n crispy oyster omelette.
Just remember tell auntie u want crispy version."
"Situated in the SAM Marsiling Mall and Hawker Centre.This stall sells several food items, like Fried Carrot Cake, Fried Oyster Omelettte, Fried Kuay Teow,Mee Goreng, Fried Hokkien Prawn Mee.Have tried the Oyster Omelette, Fried Kway Teow and Mee Goreng.All three items are quite good, worth trying.The prices range  from $3 to $10 ( depend on what items ordered ) . These prices are average hawker prices ( reasonable and affordable ).It is easily accessible by own transports, taxis, public buses. As for mrt trains , you have to walk a distance. The nearest mrt station is Marsiling Mrt Stn which may need a15 to 20 mins walk.

The food is soooooooo dammm good 5stars amazing recomened to go there everyday !!!
" Shameful and Disrespectful Behavior - This Needs to Be Called Out 

We are a very regular customer to this Soon Soon cafe .
Today, I witnessed something absolutely disgusting--and I'm speaking out not just for myself, but for every foreign domestic worker who is mistreated and disrespected in silence.
I took my elderly mother--who is 89 years old and in a wheelchair--to a coffee shop known as Soon Soon Huat Curry puff. I've been patronizing for years. With us was my trusted helper from Myanmar, a kind and hardworking woman who devotes her days to caring for my mother with compassion and dignity.
After we finished our meal, my helper thoughtfully tried to return the crockery to the tray area to clear some space. Instead of being appreciated, she was rudely and aggressively scolded by the coffee shop owner or assistant  a middle aged slim lady with short hair wearing spectacles --simply because she's a maid. The owner barked at her to leave the plates and didn't even have the basic decency to speak with respect.
Let's be honest: if it were me doing that instead of my helper, would she have been spoken to that way? Absolutely not. This was clear, blatant discrimination against someone just because she's a foreign worker.
I confronted the owner and told her clearly: My helper deserves an apology. But she arrogantly refused. No remorse, no shame. Just a cold, attitude that doesn't bother.
In fact this is not the first time I have noticed this .
 Let me be very clear: this is NOT acceptable. Not in this country. Not in any decent society.
Foreign domestic workers are human beings. They are caregivers, protectors, and in many cases, the backbone of families. My helper is a blessing to my household, and no one has the right to speak down to her--especially not someone who's running a public business.

With this kind of  Disrespectful rude attitude, this coffee shop doesn't deserve our business.  I urge others to think twice before giving business to someone who treats people like this.
Imagine if this happened to your helper who is a care giver to your elderly parents. How would this make you feel ?
I really hope the real owners of this coffee shop will stand up to do something.

We are watching. We are speaking out. And we will not stay silent in the face of abusive, elitist, and discriminatory behavior.

R. Bon"
"There are several types of curry puffs available. When I pointed at one and asked the staff whether it was chicken or another flavour, she did not respond to my question. Instead, she pointed at the wall menu and asked, ""What do you want?"" I tried asking about other food items, but again, she just pointed at the wall menu and repeated, ""What do you want?"" How is a customer supposed to know which menu item corresponds to which curry puff or dish on display?

Her tone and body language came across as very unfriendly, and she appeared to look down on elderly customers. In the end, I walked away without buying anything.

Her rude and unprofessional attitude is unacceptable, especially in a service-oriented environment like Singapore. Customers deserve basic courtesy and clear communication. It is disappointing to encounter someone so unwilling to assist or engage respectfully. This kind of behaviour reflects poorly on the establishment and may discourage customers, especially senior citizens, from returning. Staff with such an attitude are clearly not suited for roles in the food and beverage industry."
"Slightly More Detailed
""Our visit was fantastic, especially for the curry puff - it was a true standout! What truly impressed us, though, were all the traditional dishes. They're incredibly authentic and packed with amazing flavor. Plus, you won't believe how reasonably priced everything is. Highly recommend for an excellent and affordable culinary experience!"""
"Some meals please,
most forget.
But the service--
a wound, not a welcome.

No love in their hands,
no grace in their gaze.

Fix the spirit,
not just the system."
The lady boss with spec is super unfriendly. Food is nice but this kind of service not worth visiting.
"The casket aunty /maybe the owner is so rude
Ordered ice tea less sweet and it came out Super sweet and when I asked her to make it less sweet she said this is their normal standard and I'm the end reluctantly put like 10 ml of tea inside
Super bad service to new customers and only friendly to those customers she knows
DONT VISIT THIS PLACE If you never visited , is really nothing worth coming"
"Why I go there for .. kopi,  mee siam, nasi lemak n of course their curry puffs. "
Curry pok and good old kopi o .... Not many places like this left in Singapore
Service and consistent good quality of foog
Best curry puffs & coffee. I come almost everyday so you know its good 
Very nice beehoon & kopi set in the morning 
"I actually like the food here but two things made me decide not to visit again.

First the lady boss treats her foreign employee terribly. Witnessed this on several occasions. The first time, she complained about the employee to a customer in full hearing of the employee who of course kept silent. Today I overheard her repeatedly using degrading language to speak to that same employee, berating her for not doing things e right way. The poor girl just looked terrified the whole time.

Secondly, the lady boss openly favours some customers over others. She identified a couple quite far back in e queue (probably her regulars) and took their orders and gave them seats before their turn came, ahead of customers in front of them! I don't think this is right, even if they are her regulars.

She has shown that she doesn't value her customers or her employees."
My fav breakie spot in the east
Cash payment only. Not electronic payment friendly.
"Served Great Puffs...I personally like the Nasi Lemak and chicken curry puff.

Car Parking is difficult sorting peak hours."
"I recently visited Shun Fa Satay Bee Hoon at 220 East Coast Road and had a delightful experience that's worth raving about! I opted for their Coffee and Bee Hoon Set A, and it was a perfect way to kickstart my day. The set was thoughtfully put together, offering a satisfying mix of flavors and textures that hit all the right spots.

The highlight, of course, was their signature curry puff. The spiral pastry was beautifully crafted, with a crispy, flaky exterior that gave way to a generous filling of tender chicken, soft potatoes, and a mildly spicy curry paste. It wasn't greasy at all, which made it easy to enjoy without feeling heavy. The balance of spices was spot-on, catering to those who enjoy a gentle kick without overwhelming heat. It's clear why these handmade puffs, a family legacy spanning decades, draw such a loyal crowd.

The bee hoon was equally impressive--steaming hot, lightly seasoned with a savory soy-based sauce, and stir-fried to just the right texture, neither too dry nor soggy. Paired with the accompanying sides in Set A, it felt like a comforting, home-cooked meal. The coffee was a classic kopi, rich and aromatic, served with just the right amount of sweetness to complement the meal without overpowering it.

The cozy, air-conditioned coffee shop setting added to the nostalgic charm, and the service was warm and efficient despite the steady stream of customers. The staff's dedication to preserving their craft, led by the third-generation owner, shone through in every bite. At a reasonable price for such quality, this set was great value for money."
"Amazing curry puffs and mee siam is decent. However, only choosing to accept cash when there are hardly any ATMs around, that's being quite arrogant. 112 has a UOB ATM for the moment. The ESSO across the street has a DBS ATM."
"Excellent food. Friendly service. No fuss cafe, love the family atmosphere!"
Price is a factor to consider
"Food has always been good at Soon Soon Huat. Have been patronising since years ago and standard of curry puff remains solid. Place is on the whole clean and sanitary as well.

What has changed though is the service quality. While this is a coffeeshop establishment that doesn't charge service fees, consumers would minimally expect basic hospitality. When we sat down at a corner table, we were curtly told across the room that (yes she literally raised her voice across) it was meant for 4 pax, even though there were other empty 4-pax tables there and then. Anyway, we moved away quickly to the next available 2-pax table.

During the meal, some of the curry puff fillings fell out and dropped onto my hair, shorts, and skin. We requested to PURCHASE a pack of tissue from them but were told they do not sell. So we asked if they could spare us just one piece, and were informed they don't have any tissue paper at all. It's hard to accept that such a big shop doesn't have a single piece of tissue paper? Just comes across as unhelpful, unempathetic, and apathetic. My other half had to walk far away to get to our car just to get tissue. (Yes btw, parking is difficult around here; most customers park quite far away).

Used to be much better when another lady was helming the cashier. I'm a business owner myself so such heck-care attitudes are appalling to me. If only your attitude is as friendly as your curry puff.

(Edited this again from 3 to 1 star because towards the end of our meal, we saw the same lady cashier berating her foreign employee just because he had not cleaned a table outside in time. The staff appeared to have his head permanently bowed in fear of her. Said lady even lifted up her hand making it look like she was about to hit him. Shameful and atrocious behaviour esp in a public space visible to all. And in Singapore! Unheard of!)"
Rude and inflexible
Curry chicken puff nice...
"The curry puff and the Nasi Lemak are good. However, the attitude of the cashier has a lot to be desired. If these are second/third generation owners, I do hope that they know that customers are getting turned off by their attitude.

I ordered dine in and a box of curry puffs for take away.  I was seated with a companion in a two-seater table and I simply placed my takeaway order on the next table so we had more space while eating. She just shoved the box of curry puffs back to our tiny table and I said sorry because I thought there were other customers waiting for a table.  However, the place was not busy, there were a lot of other tables and no one was waiting.

This is not the first time I encountered such an unfriendly attitude. I gave it another go to give them a chance but I think she was not just having a bad day as the attitude is consistent."
"Soon Soon Huat Curry Puff draws a steady lineup, and for good reason. The team moves fast, keeping things efficient without losing the friendly touch. The curry puffs? Crisp, flavorful, and just the right amount of spice--worth the wait every time."
I have been eating this curry puff since I was a young girl. They were in different location that point of time. Super super delicious curry puff and it's one of the best.
"Nice breakfast place with superb curry puffs. Curry puffs crust is thin and flaky with lots of fillings of potatoes and chicken. Had the breakfast set too, toast is nicely toasted with butter and kaya. There is air condition dining too."
"I bought the original curry puff $2.20 / piece.  Very nice. It is very fresh. The potato filling is not very mashy type, can taste / feel the potato. Also, the filling is also juicy & not so dry that difficult to swallow. Overall, recommended if nearby & want tea break."
Ka Li Bao Hao Chi 
Decent Nasi Lemak and Curry Puff. The sambal (chili paste) and coconut rice were above average.
"One of the best flaky curry puff around, but do take note of its Cash only policy! Go across to the petrol station for the nearest ATM to avoid disappointment. Strictly Cash only. No paynow/paylah."
Good service Good Kopi.
"Wonderful place with excellent curry puffs of different types. My favourite is the sardine. There is also other varieties of food. The nasi lemak is also really good. The chicken wing is exceptional.
Love the homely service as well.
They also have the best local tea and coffee (teh & kopi) in the whole Katong area."
"Came here on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't crowded at all. The staff were very friendly and would chat with customers. I ate their original curry puffs and they tasted sooo delicious! They are huge in size and the exterior skin is very crispy. They're handmade with chicken chunks, hard boiled eggs, potato and some special gravy. I ate 2 pieces and it filled my stomach for lunch. Can't wait to try the other flavours, like potato, custard and otah. Their interior walls are filled with all the information you need to know about their stall and curry puffs, so you can read it while you're eating."
Durian puff is back!!!
"The curry Puff is good! Coffee not bad too. The rest are normal.

However the staff is super arrogant, so I'm no longer coming here.
They accept cash only. Once only had my phone/paynow/pay wave. I made a remark saying everywhere have paynow n they should have one too. The cashier very angry and say I can go other other places. So I go lor. 

Wonder why they insist on cash only business......."
"The curry puff here was very good--crispy, flaky, and filled with flavorful curry chicken and potatoes. However, I personally found the curry a bit too wet, which made it difficult to eat as the puff disintegrated quickly as it was crispy.

The real highlight for me, though, was the sesame ball. It was perfectly crispy on the outside and wonderfully chewy on the inside--definitely one of the best I've had in a long time.

Just a heads up, they only accept cash for payment, so make sure you're prepared."
"Visited this place on 22 Dec 2024 Sunday.
Curry Puff was flaky and moist. The last time I had this was at Henderson."
"The puff is so flaky and soft you could be mistaken that the curry puff was baked instead of fried.  I have four places that I go for curry puffs, this is best among the four. This curry puff got gravy wan! Since when have you eaten a puff where the ingredients are not mushy. Well now you know.

One curry puff with coffee-o $3.60"
"The flaky curry puff here is unparalleled. The delicate, crispy pastry almost melts in the mouth, setting the stage for the perfectly seasoned, well-textured curry filling. Its irresistible flavor and enticing aroma make it nearly impossible to stop at just one."
Great curry puffs. Only accepts cash which is a bummer. I never understand why such successful businesses choose to operate this way unless...
"Thks Max & the team, had a great fun to watch the rowdy. Would prefer to much more quiet if chose to dine-in. Will come back again.

Ordered 1 curry & 1 sardine puff. The skin was much more on thicker side. For the curry puff it was shiok with the punch of spicy."
"They lied on the media that Max Maeder the Singapore Olympic bronze start to work here. When I come to see for myself, I got extremely disappointed."
"My family lives near this shop. We have been buying their curry puffs for years. There used to be a very friendly and polite young man who always greeted and served us cheerfully when we come.
Unfortunately, this morning, an elderly lady in front of me, who ordered one curry puff and coffee, was treated discourteously and then verbally rebuffed.

After her order was placed on the tray, she asked nicely if she could change to a different curry puff. She was immediately told that she cannot make changes. Reason given was nonsensical.. ""once we take out, cannot change.""

After I got my order, I remarked to the two rude girls at the counter that their ""cannot change once order is taken out"" is ridiculous. After all, the senior customer never touched the curry puff nor breathed over it. Shee asked to change her order within 15 SECONDS!!
I was a witness to what happened.
The 2 female servers repeatedly mouthed their absolutely no-change policy despite my saying it made no sense given the context described.

The senior customer thanked me for speaking out in her defense. Soon one of the servers - presumably the daughter of the mother-founder - began her tirade of rude and arrogant remarks; such as:
""you don't like it, you don't need to come; you can go ahead and report to the police if you like; you say you won't come back again? Sure, no problem!! etc etc.

Such a rude and arrogant server-owner who obviously does not care one bit for her customers. She is ""puffed"" up with pride due to the popularity and success of her little shop. I have no doubt her mother would have taught her good manners besides making curry puffs!!

It is such a shame that after all our years of patronising this shop with good memories, they are marred instantly by this young, arrogant server-owner.

Let me say this:
"" Success in life goes beyond making money. It encompasses how you behave as a decent human being. How you treated that senior lady customer today and your attitude and behavior was totally unacceptable.

You owe your customers an apology. Just remember that pride goes before a fall. If you do not learn humility now, life will teach you - all in good time.""

You inherited this business from your grandmother. That makes you the 3rd generation to manage this business. Remember the old Chinese saying:
""Fu Bu Guo San Dai"" Wealth does not last 3 generations. At the rate you have been pissing off so many customers, this old adage will come through all too soon for Soon Soon Huat."
The cashier is DAMN RUDE!!! Talk to her half way and she just move away! Never see such a horrible attitude in my life. So what if the curry puff is nice? The amount of bee hoon set had shrunk. The standard of the coffee had dropped. I won't come back to this horrible bad attitude place.
"The thing I like about this place is that they make a very good sambal and it's free flow - can just help yourself to it. Food wise mediocre.

Service was curt and matter of fact - bordering on unfriendly.

They only accept cash payment!

Mee siam 
Good nonya style gravy with sufficient tanginess. But the taupok(hard texture) cut into very small bits was irritating to eat.

Chee cheong fun 
Powdery and lacked chewy texture. Sauce was good though.

Yam cake 
Mainly just flour.

Curry puff 
Stuffed full of potatoes and some chicken. But the skin was too heavy and doughy - very ""jelak"".

Sardine puff 
Good sardine filling but again the skin was too heavy and doughy - very ""jelak"".

Coffee 
Quite robust but too little milk.

Half boiled eggs 

Kaya and butter toast. 
Bread had a stale texture instead of being light and slightly crispy."
"Aircon coffee shop with best curry puffs! The puff-egg-coffee set is about $5, and the morning crowd seems to subside after 9am. The Chee-Cheong-Fun and Yam Cake is terrific, with good sauce and chili. The Mee Siam gravy is very tasty, but I feel it could use a little more Peanuts, more Tao-Pok and more Jiu-Cai. Next time I'd be packing home to add more ingredients myself, because I really like the Mee Siam gravy!!!"
One of the better curry puffs in Singapore. Signature puff is $2.20
"Food was kinda ok, but the staff have a very bad attitude. The lady at the counter asked me ""coffee or tea"", I said coffee, and they passed me copi immediately without asking for more details.
Then I said could I change to copi o kosong, she said: ""your coffee is served, we are not going to change for you. DRINK IF YOU WANT; IF NOT, DON'T WASTE THE TIME.""
Really ill-mannered."
I did a takeaway of the classic chicken curry puff this morning without any drama. The famous/infamous lady with short hair & glasses asked if I wanted the puffs individually wrapped or boxed. Puffs still taste divine. I would like to encourage potential customers not to be discouraged by poor reviews. We do not know why service was bad for them but I am happy to report that I was served 'normally'.
My favourite place for a good breakfast or afternoon snack.
"We encountered bad service attitude from both the 2 young lady staff when placing order and also when serving coffee tea to us by 2 different lady staff, equally bad attitude from them. We were also reminded there's a one hour restriction or time for eating regardless of what we eat or drink and cannot eat food brought from outside (which we are aware as one of us was holding a pizza box).
Nobody came when we left."
"Come here quite often for the curry puffs. But we had a bad experience with the short hair lady boss today. Rude and haughty over a drink order which I said was wrong but I guess she didn't agree. Small thing but she made it so unpleasant and ruined my breakfast. Seems like she doesn't care about our business - might as well, as we wouldn't be back."
"Probably one of the best curry puffs I've ever had!!! The crust was so flaky and crisp, and the filling had so much flavour. Highly recommended!"
"Had the curry chicken curry puffs at SGD2.20 each.
Love the crust, very flaky. At the same time it is also a con because it can get quite messy. Ingredients aren't skimped on. Curry wasn't really spicy but it was still flavourful. Only cash is accepted here!"
A friend ask me to try his breakfast haunt. Old school feel with cooling interior. Nice place to catch up indeed. But the food is....  Curry puff is really really good. Kopi O wise is a definitely miss for me. Mee Siam is very much water down.....  Food Quality B Quantity A Service A+
Food is ok for breakfast choices. Lady owner running the place is not the most polite person especially when you don't follow her rules.
One of the best curry puffs around. Flaky skin with delicious fillings. Time and effort went into the making. May the owners continue with the good job.
"was a great dining experience, v friendly and cool environment. the sardine curry puff was my favorite!! definitely will visit again"
"Very ordinary place. Nothing to shout for except maybe the curry puff, but not my preferred outlet."
"Good chicken curry puffs with decent quantity of curry potato fillings. Only accepts cash though. In this day and age, the boss here should start thinking about moving on to include cashless payment as well!"
"Friendly neighbourhood shop. The cashier aunty knows us and says hi even if we just pass by. Great curry puffs, yam cakes and sesame/peanut balls. Nasi lemak sambal to die for."
must try the durian puff
"Subpar customer service. Service staff at the cashier not paying attention when taking customer orders. Have to remind her that cash has been handled to her. Another service staff, seems to be the owner, remove water bottle and claimed there is no reservations of table. She said its written on the shop front. Even so, the signage is not obvious for customer like me.

Ordered breakfast set, decent teh c. Meal was alright, value for money.

Toasted bread could be better, bread is on the thicker side. Big size soft boiled eggs."
"The young lady serving at counter is extremely rude. No common sense for customer service nor basic patience expected of service provider. I wanted to buy Sardine puff, yet got slammed with ""no more!"". Repeatedly asked me rudely if I wanted ""otah"", when I have not even once mentioned. There are better sardine and curry puffs elsewhere. This is not a place I will visit again nor recommend to anyone."
"Lovely curry puffs .  Brought the family here for a nice tea break.  Bought each of us the signature curry puffs.  Perfect skin puff texture.  Fluffy and layered. Generous fillings of potatoes, eggs and chicken cubes "
They sell good tasty curry puffs. However the puffs are becoming overpriced costing $2.20 up by 20 cts early this year. As a regular customer I was really annoyed when they did not give me a transparent take away plastic when I requested claiming it is not their commom practice unless 2 puffs are bought.  Getting very expensive and calculating!
"Had potato curry puff ($1.50) for snacks, was quite good. They served lots of other food besides curry puff. They only accept cash, do take note."
Best curry puffs ever! Lovely people too.
Love this place. Our frequent place for breakfast.
"this place actually serves decent breakfast fare. we have been eating here for years - that makes us regulars, until today.

recently, to boost business, they started reserving tables for tourists on the katong heritage trail tours on weekends, however the timing of tourists' arrival is never accurate due to the walking nature of the tours.

this morning, i requested to sit at one of the reserved tables and promised that i would leave once the tourists trickled in (my fam were only having kopi and traditional toasts so it's a fast meal). instead one of the staff (the short haired lady with glasses) shouted at me and relegated us  to sit beside the toilet entrance and egg stack OR to sit outside along the pedestrian sidewalk.

this particular staff has a tendency to be rude to customers - raising her voice at them when things don't go her way. this has happened before at the shop, only this time, it happened to me.

the founder of Soon Soon (aunty has passed) may have developed a great curry puff recipe, but if her children / grandchildren running the shop today, adopt such arrogant attitudes in Singapore's F&B industry, that's rather unfortunate.

by the time we finished our breakfast barely 10 mins later, the whole row of reserved tables were still sitting empty.

and you know what? it'll probably be my last visit here as well - Nobody wants to pay for a meal, and be treated like a second class citizen in a F&B setup. there are other equally good curry puffs in singapore (maybe better), and the same for traditional kaya toasts.

post note:
i decided to check other google reviews to understand if i was the only one to have encountered such an unpleasant situation. i felt vindicated, so many other one-star reviews all attributed to this short haired lady with the glasses, whom some had said is the owner, and who had successfully created a bad experience for so many other customers too.."
The curry puffs are good but the main lady at the counter is extremely rude and unfriendly. Snaps at customers and doesn't agree when coffee orders are made wrongly. Have experienced this a few times now. It's hard to enjoy a good curry puff when you're faced with such a bad attitude. A real pity.
The lady at the counter always remained unpleasant with customers. I would say rather rude.
"I recently visited Soon Soon Huat and, while the curry puff was absolutely delicious, my overall experience was disappointing due to the service.

Firstly, there was only one soya sauce bottle available in the entire restaurant. The male staff took it from my table without asking and gave it to another customer, which I found quite rude. Even though he did quickly return it so that I could add it into my soft boiled eggs.

Furthermore, I was not allowed to sit at a table for four, even though I mentioned that my 2 friends were arriving shortly, despite the restaurant not being that crowded at all. And we had already ordered some food to munch on before they came. The female service staff was rather unnecessary with the constant taunts of ""Your friends not here yet, right?"" and ""Here cannot chope table."" I eventually decided to head off after finishing my food, and recommended to my friends to eat somewhere else.

When I attempted to provide feedback about these concerns, the service staff at the cashier responded with a blank look and no acknowledgment of my comments, which was really quite disheartening.

While the food was excellent, the service issues significantly detracted from the overall experience."
Food not nice
"Bad Service whereas the counter staff is very unfriendly and rude, toxic environment especially they look down those wearing ""worn shirt"""
 Downgrading service to ZERO star. Sheer arrogance. AVOID.
"I am a regular here, always coming in after church for currry puffs. I mistakenly forgot to mention I wanted no sugar for
My drinks, n asked for water in place of my sugared beverages. They said they don't sell ice water , just mineral water. Ok fine, for your arrogance, this will be the last of me here .."
"Now I know why I always pass by and business is bad. I had a terrible experience. Staff are very unhelpful and the food tastes horrible. There are seats but staff say it's reserved. The bee Hoon is full of msg, after eating we felt thirsty. Sad to say I came here with a happy mood but left with my mood destroyed for the day. Curry puff is $2.2 for a half palm sized. Tanjong Pagar curry puff has much larger size and more yummy. Skip this if you can"
"First time there and probably the last. While the curry puffs were good (potatoes a bit raw for my liking) service s!cks!

Why do two or three persons need to be in the queue for food? An old couple with son have to queue together and not allowed to be seated in the shop first.

Why do they need to allocate 2-person seats while we are already in one?

Why cash only?

Why black face to people who don't know your SOPs (which is weird and abnormal to many!). Can't take time to explain then just follow the norm.

I know your business is good, but if you don't respect your customers, they will not hesitate to go to the next shop."
"Nice curry puffs. The queue is efficient.
Cash only (minus one star)."
Very flaky sardine puff. Skin not too thick and their sardine filing includes onion.
"Super good curry puff! Totally not greasy, smaller than ock curry puff but doesnt have the jelat feeling after finishing. The puff is nice and crusty, stays crispy even after a few hours. Filling is good too. Only accepts cash"
"It was my first time to try this place and I was so satisfied and happy to try their puffs! :)
I tried their curry puff and sardine puff and both of them were super yummy!! I want to visit there again and try other puffs too.
The lady at the counter was very kind and attentive.
Thank you!!!!!"
Very good curry puff!
"Zai Di Ren Tui Jian Hen Hao Chi De Ka Li Bao,Hao Chi Dao Zai Duo Mai Hui Fan Dian Chi "
"My colleague surprised us with curry puffs from Soon Soon Huat, and wow! They were some of the best I've ever had! The potato filling was perfectly cooked - soft and fluffy, with just the right amount of heat. The real star of the show, though, was the crust. It was incredibly flaky and crisp. It actually reminded me of those famous Michelin Bib Gourmand brand -  light, airy, and utterly delicious. Highly recommended!"
"Best Curry Puff in my life!

There was queue but it's very fast. We came on saturday morning, so the seat almost full but we managed to sit outdoor side, sadly next to a trash bin so it was a bit smelly haha. But again, BEST CURRY PUFF EVER!!!

Would love to come back again on my next singapore trip! Recommended!!!"
"My family's go-to, definitely one of the better curry puffs around! Flaky, light pastry with a delicious curry chicken filling.
Cashless payments accepted. Street parking only (limited spaces).

Edit Mar 2024: Not sure why the store has regressed and only take Cash payment now."
"If you are around the area and craving for local pastries like curry puff , sardine puff , sesame ball , and custards, this shop will offer you that ""old-school taste."" All tasted great ."
It's all good.
"Curry puff famous. They start to do other Kaya and toast and local noodles. Pretty much another Kaya and toast shop with crossover from their famous curry puff.

A good joint with air con for those wanna rest their legs in hot Katong area."
"I tried the custard puff and it was honestly so good! However, the shop closes quite early and I can't buy them after school:( anyways great custard puff and recommend going there!"
"Amazing curry puff, handmade by Soon Soon Huat. Whenever I am in the east side of Singapore, I would drop by Soon Soon Huat, hoping to grab some curry puffs to share with my family and friends. They sell out quite fast so they are usually piping hot if I get to purchase them (before they run out). There are dine-in and takeaway options. I find the fillings very generous and crust is crispy and well-sized. Price is reasonable too. Would highly recommend this brand if you love a well-made curry-puff (made with love and passion :))"
"Shifted gears from Chin Mee Chin's endless queue and stumbled upon Soon Soon Huat Curry Puff. Opted for a quick snack--divine decision! While waiting for the Chin Mee Chin line, spotted Soon Soon Huat offering a simple breakfast--two half-boiled eggs, two kaya toasts, and a choice of teh or coffee tarik. Zero regrets changing plans; the simple breakfast set stole the show! Plus, the curry puff? Supergood! Totally recommended breakfast pivot!"
"Bought 2 chicken curry puff to go, and I must say it was great. The pastry was very buttery and flaky. Wasn't spicy si very suitable for children or people that can't take spice too!

If I lived in the area I definitely would come by more often!"
Curry puff are not tasty tbh.. not sure how the rest rate them. Service is okay tho just the food aren't tasty at all
"All the foods are so so. Nothing special at all.
The curry puff is just ordinary. Not worth the wait"
One of my go-to places for curry puff and sesame ball.
"24 Nov 2023: Amazing curry puff from Soon Soon Huat and it is love at first bite. We got the potato, sardine (a little spicy) and their signature curry chicken puff. Generous filling, crispy pastry (flaky buttery crust) and it isn't oily at all."
"Great food, and friendly boss "
"Curry puffs are spiral shaped and flaky, the crispy outer shell falling apart under your teeth with a satisfying crunch. Yet the fillings are incredibly moist, with a complex taste of curry spices enveloping comforting potatoes and juicy chicken cubes.

However, the surprise here, is that SSH cafe does really decent nasi lemak, and curry chicken cutlet rice. Maybe it is the frying expertise at work here, but the rice is nice on its own.

The cafe that serves most of the staff from the other cafes in the area. One of my favorite, unfussy breakfast spots."
"I have not been there for a long time but if I do, its take-away of few snacks.
I will not dine in there again because of rude lady boss; with short hair and spectacle at the counter. I wonder if she has improved on her attitude.
She is uptight about the seating arrangement and will dictate where you should sit with her lousy attitude.

She should consider not to serve customers at the frontline given so many feedbacks about her rude behaviour."
"Chicken Curry Puff was good, kind of reminisce the A1 CCP at Taka and you could never go wrong with Fried Springroll. However, it was another failed for the Honey Lemon here. Like most HL you could get in Sg, the ratio between honey/lemon was like 20%/80%. It seems the only decent honey drink to get are from KOI or GongCha at double the price but at least you get what you paid for."
My repeated go to for bee Hoon! Springy noodles and not oily
The curry puff is amazing. I just keep coming back for more every week. Yummy !
"Shi Zuo  Li Jiao(Hao Shi),Luo Bo Gao Yi Ban,Nai Cha Du Ke Yi. "
"Food ok and good
Service very poor and seller/management not friendly as well as very rigid esp even you cone in Four refusing to join 2 tables together but asking you to sit separately
How to dine as a family and having to dine separately
Service need to improve immediately otherwise cannot imagine"
"The short hair lady aunty was very impatient and rude to me and my husband. We were the first in the queue early morning and first time visiting this eatery with good expectation. However, she shouted and commented at us that we were taking up time and blocking the way when we were still looking at the menu and wanted to order more items and money to pay (less than a min). Even then, at least be courtesy and nice enough to just tell us nicely to sort out things near the table or so. Her attitude really spoils our day. Disappointed with the bad service. Good food but poor service and attitude. :(
We requested for 3 chicken curry puff but was given 2 and 1 potato puff. Ended up paying 50 cents more despite clarifying multiple times."
"Edit: attitude improved alot, service was fantastic , love the food too, would definitely recommend."
"The food was ok, but the the short haired staff with specs attitude is bad, saw her scolding customers on a couple occasions."
"really nice curry puff! probably the best in town. Pi Bo Cui,Hao Duo Liao,Yi Li Li Liao Quan Bu Du Shi De Chu Xi Mie Ye,You Xiang La,Wu Xi Si La "
"Curry puff, sardine puff, otah puff, mee siam, nasi lemak etc etc are all delicious. The biggest problem is trying to decide what to order as everything tastes good!

Queue and order your food, before proceeding to get a table. Cash only."
"I can appreciate their food but honestly, their lady boss is such a bit*h (the short hair lady with glasses).
I was just asking politely for better seats as we have a baby with us. Then she proceeded to scoff us with impatient replies and show us unnecessary attitude.

Just go there for the food and don't expect any decent service."
"Good curry puffs, the Kaya toast is nice as well.

Things to try curry puff, otah puff, Kaya toast and on sundays durian puff"
"Good place for breakfast, though prices a bit steep.  While most people prefer their bestseller curry puff, I prefer their sardines puff which is more flavourful."
Good tea.  Curry Puff is ok.  But I refer it to be more spicy rather than sweet.
"This place provides a nostalgic feel of the 90s, nestled in a quiet shophousr in east coast road.

Free parking till 830am everyday. It is perfect for my morning yuan yang cofee and chee cheong fun."
"Flaky and buttery crust. Delicious! Curry filling flavours lack of depth... needing more sweetness from use of onions  no bad eat but definitely not the best on the island.
Great service from counter, wife only has enough cash to pay for 9 but intended to buy 10 (yes, no electronics payment). Cashier simply waived off the loose change. Superb customer service!"
"We ordered nasi lemak, chilli is fantastic,  curry rice is awesome . Of cos cannot miss out their curry and sardine puff. Service is good too."
"The curry rice and the curry puff is so good. I love it.
The young girl at the counter attitude is very good. 5/5  highly recommended and will come again"
Curry puff the best!!!
"Delicious crispy curry puff and the filling was juicy and flavourful, although just a tad salty. The pastry is so flaky it disintegrated before I could finish it when eating from the paper sleeve. Cashier was friendly too. Would definitely return."
"A local favorite, you will find authentic and tasty curry puffs with innovative flavours that you can enjoy as well. The otah and sardine puffs are also very tasty. They have other breakfast options like the chicken cutlet curry rice which uses the curry puff ingredients and pairs it with rice for a hearty start to the day"
"Was greeted by a warm smile before even step in. Love the service, place , most important the yummy n addictive curry puff. Hot tea and coffee are very nice too!!  Tabao another 4 curry puff before we leave.

Will come back again!"
"#1st review#
I bought takeaway fishballs, curry chicken curry puff and sardine curry puff. They are delicious.

#2nd review# (8 months later)
This morning I tried the Bee Hoon which comes with a piece of luncheon meat, sunny side up egg, and shredded egg. It was delicious, especially when eaten with the sambal chili."
"Get ready to indulge in the mouthwatering flavors of the curry chicken puff and otah puff! These delightful treats are a must-try.

The curry chicken puff is packed with tender potato cubes, mildly spicy curry chicken, and a quarter hard-boiled egg. Meanwhile, the otah puff is generously filled with plenty of fish otah paste. The puff pastry itself is a delicious masterpiece - thin, flaky, and oh-so-crispy. Each bite offers a satisfying crunch.

Personally, I have a soft spot for the curry chicken puff. Its rich and savory fillings perfectly complement the buttery puff pastry, creating a tantalizing combination of flavors. But don't take my word for it - try them both and let your taste buds decide!"
"It was one of the best curry puffs that I have ever tasted. It's juicy, succulent, and tasty. Paired with a cup of black coffee, it's really delicious and satisfying. This is a shop worth a special visit."
"We been always patrons this eatery. They serves the best curry puff. Today was the unfortunate event,the lady boss seems to be facing PMSss. When she assigned a table. The table was dirty. That's normal when comes to busy period. After when we seat. We asked 1 of the staff to wipe. SHE come and scold us not to tell their staff to do work. ""SHE IS BUSY WITH BREAD."" later a few event she just give us a staring look."
"Encountered the rudest auntie with short hair and specs. We requested for one of her colleagues to help wipe the table.  When her colleague about to come over with the cloth to wipe our table she yelled out loud that she SHOULDNT wipe our table she needs to prepare the clean work which is the bread first. When this loud auntie came over after few minutes, I've made remark not required to wipe already, since she was reluctant  to wipe. She further retorted of course her staff needs to do clean stuffs first while we had a plate of food with us. She went on rambling for another few minutes to her staff so that as if she's right. We understood that the table must not be wiped immediately but the auntie made us felt that we were wrong if her staff didn't know how to prioritise.  Venting her frustration over her staff and us as customer was uncalled for."
Fantastic curry puffs. Great breakfast place. Chilli is VERY hot.
The curry chicken puff is really very good. Service isn't the best but generally fine. Can't complain must for such a tasty curry puff at $2.
"Been here only twice. First time I was told off by an extremely impatient staff. I struggle with hearing, and was arrogantly told off for not giving my food order as he asked,  I apologised for being old and hard of hearing but had to tell him he will be old one day too.
Second time I was there, I was rudely told off by an aggressive female staff for paying with too many coins. How many coins was too many? I had ordered only 2 curry puffs. Sadly, good business has gone to their heads."
I was a regular customer until I found a hair in their curry puff. Brought the curry puff showed the staff but what the staff did was just replaced a new curry puff. Never apologize at all. The short hair staff was so rude to me.
"Curry puff was super good and flaky. Coffee and ice Milo was also good on a hot day, but fried Popiah could have better as  pastry was soft when served."
"Food is average, but coffee is not hot. My worst experience is the counter aunty, she is rude, bias, Inpatient and unprofessional."
A small cafe selling local eats. The food standard is above average. My usual is CCF and yam cake mixed.
"Crispy flaky dough match well with the generous amount of fillings which consist mostly potato and chicken. Though we had one that quite salty but overall it was good.

Expect quite a long queue especially on mornings, but they serve fast so it was definitely worth the wait."
"I had the sardine puff, tasted average. Dining at the eatery felt like we travelled back in time. Old school comfort food for the regulars, I guess."
They were closed for an extended period despite website indicating they were open! What a waste of time travelling down from Tampines.
Great tasting curry puffs. Friendly service. Reasonable prices.
"Best curry puff in Singapore,  ever!!!"
"Have been following this curry puff since the time they were in Henderson. Lost them for a while after they moved from Kim Tian. So glad to find them again in East coast.

Skin is crispy n layered due to the dough folding technique. Fillings are full n moist.

Alway buy extra to keep for next day breakfast. Just Toast in oven toast n still crispy."
"Love their local coffee, nasi lemak and mee siam. Patronised many times. Tasted their curry puffs thrice, too salty for me."
"The last time I came to buy, but it was close on that day. I couldn't try it until today (8 months ago)

I ordered 10 pcs of Chicken Curry Puff and 10 pcs of Potato Curry Puff to bring back to Melaka for my family and friends to eat.

It was really light flaky tasty pastry! I am impressed that the flaky was really really thin yet buttery tasteful. They also have varieties of puffs.

Definitely will come again if I have the chance. FYI, it was really long que, you gotta wait patiently."
Lady boss very unfriendly and likes to scold her staffs. Very bad service.
"My wife and I come to eat here on a weekly basis, and their curry puffs are fresh & warm!

They also include the staple breakfast sets such as kaya toast, mee siam, nasi lemak, Bee Hoon and more.

I highly recommend their curry puffs! My go to are custard and chicken!

The service is also great!"
"Not good, very dry.."
"Curry potato puff..best seller..
"
"Curry chicken puff is fantastic although I find it a bit pricey. I like the puff skin, also curry chicken inside with bit of sauce, so not dry up kind. Tried sardine puff, also good . Dine in might not be good option as very hard to find parking, also a bit stuffy inside."
My comfort food
"Decided to visit the restaurant after watching the restaurant featured on Xing Qi Er Te Xie. There was a 2-minute queue on a Sunday morning. Ordered a couple of breakfast food - curry puff, mee siam, chee cheong fun, and coffee. Food was ok, nothing bad nor outstanding. Parking was a nightmare."
"Was here this morning 8th April 2023 around 9.15 am.

There was already a queue and lots of people at the outlet. Food was being pushed out the kitchen quickly and being snapped up quickly as well.

We ordered 1 chicken curry puff $2 and 1 potato curry puff $1.80.
Flaky but not oily. Hot. Curry fillings are balanced and moist. Not too spicy. Can see some chicken pieces and the potato is nicely soaked.
This is now my favorite curry puff in sg despite the higher price.

The bread is from another store so do ignore for now.

Recommended."
Popped in to pick up currypuffs.  Delicious.   Generous filling & nice curry flavour.  Sardine was very good too.  Didn't try the rest.
Love the flaky curry puff and the fillings as well! Service is great.
E Curry n Otah ones r 
"Had the curry potato puff. Pastry is very well done, flaky yet not oily. The queue can be quite discouraging but moves quickly so waiting time can be shorter than you expect. It's a pity some of the other puffs were sold out when I was there. They only take cash payments only."
"Curry puff was still hot when we had it and they were really generous w their fillings. Pretty nice curry we got here too 

My friend took away their otah puffs and she said she regretted not getting more because they were good!"
Tried to order coffee black with sugar at the side so that I can add the amount I like. Cashier that took the order (Chinese lady with glasses and blinking eye) raised her voice at me saying there is no such special order. I do not understand the difficulty in leaving the sugar on the saucer instead of into the mug. Poor customer service. Walked away and noted not to patronize again.
Good Curry Puffs
Pretty solid curry puff with light flakey puff pastry and a good amount of filling. I'd love for the regular one to be abit more spicy. Sardine puff is really good.
"Very delighted with their curry puffs n chee cheong fan. As a first-timer here, I found the counter staff very helpful n patient, taking time to explain the different puffs available. Simple coffee shop with a nice kopitiam ambience. Will be back to satisfy my cravings as and when."
"One of my go to place for Curry Puffs and sesame balls. One of the best curry puffs with tasty flaky pastry, moist & aromatic fillings. The curry puff is filled with diced potatoes, chicken and a quarter hard boiled egg. It's a must to try out their fried sesame balls with either peanut/green bean fillings, they are so devilish.

Note: pls order your food at the counter before finding a seat.

I read about a lot of bad review because of the owner (short hair lady) who deemed was rude. She is not rude or blunt, she has some illness which has caused her losing hearing on 1 side of her ear as well expression. She used to be a cheerful and polite lady when I started patronising her cafe."
Curry puffs are really good. There might be a short queue (probably depends on the time of the day)
"Delicious and really good curry chicken $2 and sardine $1.50 puffs with strong curry taste, stuffed to the max into a thin crust. The sardine puff is smaller but also packed to the brim.

The curry chicken potato puff seems to have more sauce than other puffs like Tanglin crispy curry puff.

Will add this to my list of favourite curry puff shops in Singapore."
"Flaky pastry & filling match well regardless of different flavour. I lived in the West(CCK) went there twice.  The food is worth the long journey to return back. So far tried curry puff, sardine,Otah. Curry puff & sardines is very well done. Otah puff is incredible! Will come back for more."
My fav curry puffs in the whole of SG. Love the flaky crust
Their curry puff's light flaky skin was the only thing worth mentioning.
Ultimate favourite curry puff place!
"terrible service from the short hair glasses lady, asked her if sit 8 pax and combine table, all her tables and chairs are modular, and she said ""no cannot, just like that, no reason"", must split into multiple groups, not accommodating at all. Extremely rude"
"Great Tasting Curry  Puffs !!  ...  they have other bfast items , as well ... like mee siam , bfast bee hoon  ... etc ..."
These are my favourite curry puffs. I particularly like the potato and otah ones.
"Good spread of choices.
Staff friendly and atmosphere good, though a little cramp  but it is fine...value for $$$"
Used to have great curry puffs but quality has dipped. Pastry seemed oilier and tough though thinner. Kopi C lacks milk. Young unlady-like boss curt and blunt with customers and staff. Scolded staff for small mistakes and sarcastically impled customer whom accepted a glass of hot water not ordered. Unlikely to patronise this unfriendly store again.
Nice curry puff!! For the same price as the one in minimarket its like double the size and triple the deliciousness!
"Not a regular but on both occasions the thinner lady with glasses appeared to be scolding & shouting at staff and expressing anger in front of customers. She could be the owner or relative to the owner but NEVER treat other workers this manner especially in front of customers. Everyone in the queue were shaking their heads. Not fantastic puff anyway, too salty. Never going back again."
Honestly this is the best curry puff in the WORLD. try it yourself you won't regret. Each and every cuff puff is handmade and deep fried to stock up the display selve. Never selling overnight food nor food left cold for few hours. You can enter the kitchen to take a glimpse how they roll the skin to become crispy layers. Words are hard to describe anyway. Go try it yourself. FYI I got no share or interest from the stall.
Got the $5 breakfast set. Eggs were not cooked at all just totally liquid. I like runny eggs but if there is zero solid matter its not edible. The coffee was pretty goos at least.
"Food are decent, however, the lady staff attitude is not consistent, just need to be prepared."
"Chanced by this hidden gem along east coast road when wife and myself were just initially aiming for the corner coffeeshop for simple bread/egg/porridge breakfast.

Wife said coffee shop did not sell porridge so went forward to this curry puff.

This shop sells most of the typical breakfast - nasi lemak, bread/egg set, bee hoon and their famous curry puff.

Amazing taste and lightening up both our days ahead!"
"Nice puff but with attitude staff.
I went there early in the morning, some of the flavors were not yet out and I have no idea. When I asked for them, the lady replied super rude and said ""don't have them!"" Then I just asked for one box with 10 pcs, whatever have. However, the lady kept asking ""want more?"" ""want two more?"" ""want anything more?"" like more than 3 times! When I said, ""you don't have the flavors I like to order, what else I can add?"" Then she replied even ruder: ""Don't want don't want lah!""
Looked through the reviews, and I'm not the only one who experienced this. Definitely not going back anymore."
"Incredibly tasty flaky pastry chicken curry puff.  4 out of 5 stars more due to my personal preferences.  Just some nitpicking.

1) The flaky puff pastry is excellent.

2) The filling is just OK for me.

- It lacks some spiciness, I have read this is on purpose to be child friendly
- It has a sliver of hard boiled egg. For me, hard boiled eggs have no place in a curry puff filling. 
- I actually think there is too much filling.  The star puff pastry's texture gets drowned in the filling with some bites.

3) The curry puffs are usually served warm/hot as they are fried in small batches.  Such an important factor to enjoying a good curry puff.

If I could rate this 4.75 stars out of 5, I would.  It's not perfect but pretty darn close! "
"Best curry puffs on the planet. Probably, in the universe too :p"

"Other than curry puffs, this place serves pretty decent mee siam, nasi lemak, etc. Best to come by on a week day when it's not so crowded."
Curry puff - sardine and potato taste good. Crispy crust and filling is not too salty
"Great local haunt for coffee or a mid day snack. Their hot meals taste home cooked and make a hearty and simple lunch. I like the fried fish macaroni soup and the nasi lemak. Family and friends love the curry puffs, we order them often for gatherings."
"Hands down one of the best flaky curry puffs in singapore. There're so many 'flaky' ones but they're either too bland or have crusts too thick.

Soon soon huat's crusts are ultra flaky with aromatic bursts of filling. I have no idea why would people complain abt the flakiness , which is the intent of such a crust. Their kopi is very good too !"
"Flaky crust if curry chicken puff, with crispy edges. Sufficient filling of potato cubes and some morsels of chicken with a sliver of egg. Not too spicy or salty. Puff size has shrunk from previous visit almost a year back but still enjoyable as it is not too filling"
Fragrance n crispy puffs 
"Curry of not bad. It has potato, chicken or steak sardine puff."
"Curry chicken puff. Omg, out of this world. Filling is generous, crust melts in the mouth but it does not fall apart. Nasi lemak also very nice.  Must come again. Sesame balls, a hidden gem."
Crust is a little too tough for my liking
Nice curry puff
"Best tasting curry puffs ever.
Flaky , moist , very aromatic curry and even a quarter of a boiled egg found inside the curry puffs.

The only place I would come for my curry puffs ."
"We came back a total of 3 times in a span of 2 days. The 3rd time was to takeaway these puffs for our family (we live in the west).

Their curry puffs easily topped our list. Flakey, crusty, the fillings were nicely seasoned too. (Tried both the curry potato and sardine puffs) Enjoyed the coffee too!

Service was impeccable. Thumbs up to the lady boss and every employee! Don't know why I'm reading such nasty comments on service.

Would definitely travel halfway across the island for these crusty babies again!"
Read about the rave reviews and saw the long queue at the outlet this morning. Decided to try the curry puffs. Bought 4 chicken curry puffs at $1.80 each. Was impressed with the light flaky pastry. It was so light that it flaked off with slight pressure. Visually the colour and flaky crust looked appealing. However was very  disappointed with the filling of moist small cubes of potatoes and chicken. It was very salty which marred the overall taste of the curry puff. Would not buy again.
"Quaint place. Kopi was robust. Curry puff not oily, thin pastry with full filling. Same with the peanut ball. Both cost a tad more than other joints but imho it's worth it. Mee Siam is good; huge serving and tasty gravy. Curry chicken rice was so-so. Will return for puffs and kopi."
The curry puffs are really great. Must try! Make your priority to try the chicken curry puff or alternatively the potato curry puff.
"Delicious, first time trying a curry puff and definitely not the last. Came here as part of the Hello Singapore food tour"
"Being a 'Pac-Man' chomping fan of curry puff. I must die die eat this after reading reviews of best curry puff in Singapore. It was simply love at the first bite! Really! The crust was buttery flaky, the fillings was moist and generous. Reminded me of A1 curry puff, then read an article on the sad history of the name... Nevertheless, will definitely support this curry puff joint when I'm in Katong. After my first memorable tasting of it, was craving for it for weeks, alas was there last Monday but was closed. Today wanted to get more of it but there was only 6 curry chicken left, wanna get all but a  lady was asking if I could sacrifice 2, of course I must 'share' the lovely curry puffs. Luckily there was a fresh tray of sardine curry puff, so make do with that and the regular potatoes. The staff are extremely friendly, simply love the small chat with them. Will make an early trip in future to 'Chope' some otak and custard ones! YUMMY!"
"Go for the chicken potato curry puff! Lovely pastry, fragrant curry spice, generous filling of potato cubes, hard boiled egg slice, and some chicken.

Potato puff has the same flavours but visibly downsized.

Durian puff is a specialty, creamy filling without becoming overpowering.

Sardine puff has more onions than sardines, so I will give that a miss."
Curry chicken chop rice.... Quite delicious.....order when u visit
"Review my repeat order of 8 pc sardines puffs on 21 April 2022.  The sardine filling taste sour, , disappointed.
To be fair, we were satisfied with the sardine puff we had tried a week before."
Nice curry puff and sardine puff. Parking can be a problem though. Need to park at Joo Chiat Road or even further down.
"Food is good. Coffee n tea is good. Drinks tend to take longer to arrive but that's because Uncle making the drinks is very thorough and serious with the accuracy of the ingredients and the ""pulling"" of his tea/coffee. So worth the wait of about 10mins considering the long queue."
Big curry puffs with lots of filling but personally don't enjoy flaky crust and seasoning
Zhen De Hen Hao Chi De curry
Amazingly good curry puffs! In a different league compared to the big brands.
"Probably our favorite Curry Puffs in Singapore. So fun after a bike ride on East Coast Park! Tasty filling, flaky crust. "
"First time tried the curry puff, bought most of the flavors to try with my siblings. We tried curry puff, sardines, otah and durian.
Overall feedback , it was disappointing, 1 out of 5 ratings we will give. Not recommended if you are looking for good authantic curry puff."
They are good and very clean
"Lousy customer service! The tomboy is rude. Without buyers your shop won't survive! Be good to your customers!

Add: There is always a cause & effect. Yes you don't like people call u TB, but buyers don't like u to be rude too. Look at other buyer reviews, I am not alone. You are rude to others too. Respect need to be earned. Without buyers your shop won't survive. Be humble . Thank u & hope u really better up your service as u claimed."
Not friendly service food also expensive and so so.... Not coming back waste money  
"Their curry puff is really excellent - A1!  Tried when they were 1st at Eunos Crescent.  Today we had the yam cake, chee chiong fun & meesiam - also delicious.  Staff here are friendly & efficient.  Cooler to sit in the shop as it's airconditioned"
"Sardine Puffs and the Fish balls!

Must try!"
"Both puffs had flaky buttery skins which crumbles with a slight bite. Chicken curry puff $1.80, choke filled with mild curry spiced diced potatos with boiled egg and small chicken chunks.
Sardine puff $1.30 was packed with equal amounts of sardine and onions and is much spicier. My favourite of the two."
Great food all round.
The food taste great. Old school type. The curry puffs r nice too.
"I doubt I'll be able to find a better curry puff anywhere else in Singapore. All 5 different flavors are amazing and at least one or two will be sold out at any point. They serve local favorites such as nasi lemak and mee siam too, in a cosy space with unpretentious service."
So-so mee siam. Nothing special. Fishballs a bit soggy type not springy type. Mee siam should come w chives not springy onions btw. Their puffs are the best. But because of that fame they are unable to manage consistent good service as you can observe from the two extreme review of their service. Some say excellent some condemn their service.
"Bought 7 curry puffs and 1 mee siam , all take away. For the mee siam i gave my own container 1for the gravy and 1 for the noddles. When i asked for plastic the lady said i had to pay for the plastic bag because i used my own container. What logic is that? So i bought 7 curry puffs am i entitled to 7 plastic bags?
Can i delete my 1 star?"
"Hesitant to try the custard, otah and durian puffs but they turned out to be amazing. Go during off peak hours (in the mid morning or mid afternoon) and there're no lines. Parking can be a little tough, but what do you expect?"
Nice curry puffs. The nasi lemak and Mee siam was a pleasant surprise. Do try them too!
Ya ya attitude due to popularity. Late to open to form queue. Last time I will be here. Bye
"Great pastry (crumbly, not dry, not too greasy) and the filling (otah was all that was left) was excellent."
"The lady with short hair and gold framed glasses is unhappy working and probably has depression so took it out to innocent customers like us. First time buying and will never return. We don't deserve to be treated this way.

Not surprising to find many same kind of reviews too. i am not the first one."
Fei Chang Hao Chi
Service is rude at the shop. Reason for not allowing to change seat is virus is rampant. There were plenty of seats. It's not like the shop sterilised the seat after each seating.
Super rude lady boss who only cares about scolding people with her bad attitude (short lady with the glasses as mentioned by all the other reviewers) and substandard food.
Unfriendly staff at the counter. Paid and requested a take seat. Only puff is served. Repeatedly inform the staff for my tea while she continue to serve other drinks. A short lady wearing spectacle reply me with a rude manner.
The best chicken curry puff. So juicy n big.
Best curry puffs in Singapore! Staff is always bright and cheery too. Always a joy to come back.
"I visited them since Apr 2021 as I started to work nearby and love their crispy curry puffs (original, sardine, Durian - this only on weekends), love their tender n bouncy fishballs... love their fried fritter with peanut fillings.. and love their services too! ^_^"
Nice Breakfast
love the otah puff is fragrance and the just right spiciness suit taste bud like me who cant take very spicy food.
"Excellent curry puff! The puff is the largest as compared to others.
The crust is excellent and very thin. The potato filling is to its brim. The rempah is also flavorful. Definitely top of my list."
Sardine puff 
Really great curry puff!
Nice curry puff. Love the tuna more than the chicken though. Great taste and puffy pastry.
"Great place for breakfast, super flaky and crispy curry puff filled with generous amounts of chicken curry."
"Have to agree the curry puffs are really good. I was queuing and was told to wait 10 minutes and I was served hot pipping curry puff. Loved the crispiness of the skin and the moist and hot filling. The curry chicken is really flavourful and different from the normal dry filling in many places selling curry puffs.
Ordered a durian puff too and it was so good having a combination of sweet and savoury at 1 go!"
Best curry puff in sg
Wow. First time trying this curry puff. It's super good. Even their kopi is good and goes well with this
"The lady boss was rude. Several occasions.  Never going back after giving the place a few chances to show its good side. The guy staff who made the coffee was alright. However, the lady boss needs lessons in customer service. eg: there was a mix up in order ( and it wasn't the customer's fault), but she made the PAYING customer feel very small. I am not one to expect a smile, an eye contact or a thank you from customer service especially in Singapore. But her behaviour was inexcusable. Several friends who had patronized her shop share the same sentiments. There are many other good places for coffee and morning breakfasts in food paradise East. And they provide decent or much better service."
"My favorite spot for traditional kopi on the east side, here you can get traditional kaya toast and eggs breakfast, but they also offer many other traditional dishes.

But the best might be the puffs: perfectly golden, flakey, crunchy and so pretty to look at. I'm always in for the seasonal durian puffs which are out-of-this-world! Not too sweet, flavorful but not overpowering, creamy and decadent. And, ehem, vegetarian friendly. Nothing beats a durian puff and kopi-o to start your day."
"Best curry puffs in East coast.
Best eaten while it is still warm. The potato and fillings are ample and moist to every bite.
For those who miss sardine puffs, it is a must try."
I always buy their foods because i Love all the foods but very poor service and this time that old lady was very rude when i had a hard time counting the coins in my hand instead of giving a help ..so i will never ever buy in their shop anymore start from today
Best crispy curry puff in SG. Otah and custard are good too.
Skin is flaky and yet crunchy. Filling is normal. Better than old chang kee but still prefer ikeas curry puffs instead
"Very friendly , kind boss and lady boss...just hard to get parking"
sesame balls yellow beans or peanut filling are crisp n not oily. Best eaten within an hour.
"Although the puff is good but think they are not very interested in small order. Happen to dine in for lunch & wanted to order for 2 pc curry puff, the lady said need to wait for half an hour. But till we finish our bee hoon soup+bread & left the coffee shop, the lady dun even bother to attend to us!"
"Offering a range of fried snacks, their crispy, flakey, spicy curry puff is a classic and must-try. The crust is addictive and can get messy when eaten, best to take a seat and savour it, leaving no crumbs behind."
"Cozy place if you crave for Chinese breakfast! Ordered curry puffs, carrot cake, toast and chee cheong fun. Already 2nd time here!"
Amazing curry puff!  Kopi is good too!  Must eat for curry puffs lover!!!
"Ka Pei Hao He,Ka Li Bao Ying Gai Hao Chi,Yao Deng Zhi Shao Ban Xiao Shi,Mei Chi Dao,Bu Hao Ting Che"
"Delicious curry puff I would sacrifice my calories for, with generous amount of potato and egg.

Will return to try the other flavours!"
I think I don't need to say more here about the service. Service is horrible here. Stay away if you don't want to spoil your day!
Their curry puffs are nice. Both the skin and the filling. Nice coffee too.
Crispy and flaky puffs.. kopi was good too
A recommendation brought me here. Tasted it.... hmmm guess not perfected for my taste bud. But the thought of 'Soon Soon Huat' is great! Maybe drop by at Lottery shop after this visit....
"Cheapest teh O along East Coast Road at $1.20  and delicious curry puff that you can tell that is home made. The crust is flaky and the filling is full. At $1.80 and home made, I give 5 stars for my morning snack today. The shortcoming is the line but it is pretty worth it."
"Soon Soon Huat's got the best curry puffs and traditional Singaporean snacks like Chwee Kuay for breakfast. I love their durian puffs when it's in season, and the banana fritters are excellent. They've grown their menu since they'd opened to include noodles and chicken chops. Come here if you want to have bitter black kopi."
The curry puffs are really homemade and the durian puff is really delectable.
"Curry puffs were very good, if you like the deep fried type. The pastry is less oily than puffs made in similar way by others.  The filling had a strong curry powder bite which would have been better if cooked longer so we won't think we're tasting the powder too much.   But despite powdery texture, the curried mix taste was heavenly and highly recommended. Ordered the set kaya toast and 2 eggs and coffee as well.  Quite good.  Kaya was eggy and not as saccharine sweet as Yakun today, and quite wholesome though the bread seemed a bit chewy.  Soft boiled eggs, one overcooked with a hardened yolk and one perfect.  Coffee had a bitter burnt smell, but better than Yakun.  Service was snappy, I.e. being snapped at about where to sit and how to hurry our order, but food came quite quickly (snappy again)."
Unfriendly & not accommodative.
A nice cozy family style establishment. Nice flaky pastry curry puffs! Love it with a cup of teh
Curry puffs here are delicious ... Pastry is crispy and not too thick and the fillings are solid. Goes well with a hot cup of local tea/coffee. Enjoy :)
"Nice place to sit down, and have a curry puff and coffee. Curry puff was really flaky and full of filling. Coffee was not bad too. I went around 3 plus on a weekday afternoon so not too many people."
Some of the best curry puffs in the game! Pastry is so buttery and crumbly and the puffs are ALWAYS warm and comforting. The fried sesame balls (peanut/green bean filling) are also delish. Tea here is tasty but a little light (even when ordered gao).
Love the authentic curry puff.
Fluffy and crispy skin with moist rich curry chicken filling. Best to eat it at the shop when the curry chicken puff is still warm. Goes well with a cup of teh C kosong.
"Love love the Chee Cheong Fun with the sweet and chilli sauce at the side. Unlike other places, it's always served piping hot. Good Kopi Si Siew Dai. I wouldn't go next door to drink Ang moh Kopi. The sardines puff is very spicy but not oily.  My only complaint is  they closed quite early. They should consider to close later on Friday and Saturday night"
Lovely the puffs and coffee here !
"The best curry puff and coffee in Singapore. I will always order the sardines curry puff along with a nice cup of Kopi O. If you are a lover of traditional coffee, it will be worth traveling just for this. Mee Siam and Bee Hoon is another favourite of mine. Parking might be an issue so do take note. It will be a worthwhile trip."
Up price already. But do take note of their operating hours over CNY. Puffs still taste good.
"Feb 2021. Queued up only to be told the sardine and curry potatoes were overordered and had to wait for 20 minutes.  No choice but ordered carrot cake (only one piece left), two banana fritters and two otah puffs.  Price of $9.80 was a little expensive, I felt.  Will probably not come back if they cannot ensure supply of curry puffs. They should at least put up a sign so people will not join the queue if items are not ready.

Jan 2021 Ate there and also bought home for the family to try.  The curry puffs have a lovely flaky skin, without being oily, and held up well travel wise.  The insides were okay, and not spicy, though I would have preferred more bite - the potato bits were uniformly small in size and a tad mushy.  I would not say this was top three - I like the genie ones in Realty Park and the J2 ones at Amoy Street - but it is better than some others.

The coffee and tea were pretty ordinary though.   Service was okay.  Would not specially drive here to buy, but may try if in the area."
"Food is nice , but the staff need improve. Is rude and impatient, it's the same for two consecutive days.  No listen what the guest needed.  Just leave the shop 5 to 10 minutes only,  go back ask for get back receipt, need to face they satirize customers, blame why don't ask receipt when order even I did mention I need receipt. Strong feeling when step out the shop, u are not they customer.  They no need be nice with u"
Nasi lemak is my favourite.
Favourite place for curry puffs and morning kopi! Quick fix for chwee kueh too
"Love the place. Besides puffs, they HV other local delights. Try it"
"Simple curry puff shop in Katong area, sells few different flavours with prices ranging from $1.70 to $2.20. Chicken curry puff was loaded with ingredients and generously filled. Not mindblowingly good but great for pricepoint."
"Contrary to some of the other reviews, I didn't find anything abhorrent about the service. In fact I thought the service was quite efficient. The chicken curry puff had a fresh, flaky pastry of just the right thickness which I liked. Not oily too. However, I thought that the filling was a little on the mild side. Would've preferred more curry spice in my curry puff. Good but not the best."
Nice leh this curry puff will come back for more. Worth the trip if you live in the west. Too yummy to take photo
"In light of safe management measures, I suggest that a sign is put up to manage the queue and dine-in as it's confusing for patrons whether we queue first or order first. The bad experience just spoils the mood resulting in non-repeat visits."
"Curry puffs were great! Coffee not bad, Chwee Kueh so so."
No frill truly local breakfast place. Nice staffs and clean. Foods choice are good.
"Love the nasi lemak here. But often served after 830am which is not helpful for office workers. You can choose the beehoon with nasi lemak ingredients (egg, chicken wing, peanuts and belachan) but it lacks the kick. Very friendly family crew.

PS: I just saw a review by a lady complaining about the boss-lady screaming and claiming deafness. I am a regular and I've never seen her screaming at customers. And in case this fact is lost, the boss-lady is a bit hard of hearing due to a recent illness for which an ear operation was required. Before people flare up, they should walk in someone else's shoes."
"I have to agree with B Wong on poor service. The lady with short hair and glasses just screamed and said she's deaf, when she couldn't hear my order. What a pity as their curry puffs are good and their other staff are ok."
"Poor service  / Food good ......Food & drink are good, especially the curry puff & Bee Hoon very delicious!  But the service very poor! The ""skinny"" & ""wearing glasses"" little younger girl so rude!  Quite disappointed"
Definitely one of the top 3 curry puff in SG(and top in the East for sure). Fresh off the fryer all the time. very well prepared curry chicken potato filling. And very good flaky skin.Make such good snack and i am proud to bring these morsels to friends anytime. I am so glad i stay nearby
nice curry puff...Best then a lot of brands. Gd place to chill
"Totally put off with horrible attitude today! Was told off for sitting on the table for 4 (we are 2a2c) just because we order 4 puffs, 1 fishball and 2 coffees and were deemed too small an order to be sitting there. So we should split tables instead. Never going to patronize again for such arrogant business"
Nice coffee and desert. :)
Their puffs are all handmade and v crispy!!
"Had the potato chicken curry puff and mee siam. Nice.
Was told to order first instead of scanning safe entry and they don't insist. Was uncomfortable with that. Also I find the staff's attitude toward customer rather unfriendly. Definitely not a place for me to start my day. Was given a buzzer to collect my food but it doesn't say where to collect. Maybe you have to be a regular to know and to be treated differently. But again where food is concern, its good."
"GOOD SERVICE , CLEAN, TASTY"
Walked past the shop on the way to work and decided to try their curry puff. Crust was flaky and crunchy with its filling packed. But the curry lacks flavour and spice.
"Best curry puff, especially the tuna."
love their durian puff !!!
One of the best ard... Coffee is great...  Will go back again
"I've been to this place a bunch of times post cycling for coffee, kaya butter toast and curry puff. Taste is good, food is affordable and service is reasonably prompt. I particularly enjoyed the curry puff - it was just the right level of moist, without being too spicy or oily."
Nice cozy place with delicious curry puff.
Superb savoury puffs! My favourite is the otah puff!
"Nasi lemak is good, the chicken wing is crispy and chunky. Less good was the kopi, usually too sweet, even when ordered siew tai. Not enough coffee taste, too much sugar. There is some air-conditioning, so it's more pleasant than without in this heat"
"Just bought the puff havent tried the food but received very rude service from the staff. Coming from service industry, i find this unacceptable."
"Delicious tasty curry puffs! I love the buttery crust. And each puff is packed with lotsa ingredients! I always order more for takeaway, can just warm it up in the oven, taste so heavenly!"
"Love their curry puff, tea and coffee."
"The Best Curry puffs In Singapore!! Fillings are generous!! Love the flaky pastry which is NOT oily!!
Love the friendly service rendered!!"
Loved the tea set offer of one drink plus a curry puff for $2.60 to $2.80.
Super bad attitude from cashier.  Will never go ahead!
First time to visit this place. Very interesting and tasty curry puffs.
Curry puff here is superb! Drinks like tea or coffee taste good too. Good place for breakfast or tea time!
"Family-owned place selling curry puffs, Mee Siam, Nasi Lemak and REAL GOOD coffee (the traditional type, brewed in a sock bag).

Their curry puffs are the best in Singapore! Filled to the edge of the skin with generous ingredients, the owners hand make each and every single piece of curry puff with love. Flaky and crisp layers of puff pastry are paired with well-marinated fillings. A definite must-try when you're here.

Their other main dishes are also delicious! Coffee lovers should get a cup or maybe 2! of their Kopi! Strong, robust and not too sweet. I'm not a coffee drinker but I'll always order a cup when I'm here.

Come on Sundays and if you're early enough, they sell Goreng Pisang (fried banana fritters) a must order snack. The bananas are fried to crisp perfection. They use only ripe and juicy bananas. These babies sell out fast by mid day.

Many food blogs and bloggers have reviewed this place but I must say it still: Soon Soon Huat is a jewel of Katong!"
"Soft skin and watery curry - the kind I like.
Not thick skin and more paste than meet - the overrated kind."
One of the best curry puffs in Singapore.
"Parents had on multiple occasions been told off by the lady boss! This is a horror - how can someone in the service industry scold their customers simply for sitting at a table that the boss didn't like them to? Put a sign and say ""i am the boss and I dictate where you sit"" to warn your customers :) I mean, if you serve bad curry puffs (which you do), i can still close an eye. But if you have bad service attitude, then seriously check your attitude and see if you should be here lol.

Also, just a response to the comment by the owner to another customer's feedback below... customers decide how they want to pay you. you do not run a business controlling where your customers sit, or whether your customers pay in coins or notes. If you wish to be so domineering, do it at home. I suggest you sign up for classes teaching you how to treat your customers."
"The lady boss's attitude was shockingly bad. Just this morning, they made a mistake about my bill, charging me extra. I didn't realise. She was honest to return me the extra but did so in an entitled way, almost like I should be grateful which in fact, I was
, until i realised that she was speaking in such a condescending tone, suggesting that I shouldn't double-check on the bill and the last straw was when she threw this last remark: ""it would be better if I hadn't return you the extra!"" before storming off back to the counter. I mean... wow... I was quite taken aback at that point in time. I mean I thought it was reasonable that I should double-check since a mistake was made by them in the first place. Anyway, just before leaving the place, I feedback that her attitude was bad. She said, ""But why do you have to check when I've already returned you the extra? Ok then, I apologise. Ok already? Can already? ""She said this repeatedly, in an irritated tone. And her facial expression totally matched her tone.  At this point, I think she had totally missed the point. (There were no new customers at the queue as I've waited when the counter was less busy to speak to her) I will never step into this place again."
"Lousy attitude of the cashier at East Coast. We merely take a longer time to order and pay and the woman at the counter said ""wow you take such a long time to order and long time to pay."" and start to shake her head. The food here is not cheap.

Yes the curry puff is nice but its not the way to treat your customers esp when your food is priced at a higher range.

Avoid unless you want to receive bad attitude.

Update: just to clarify, there was only one customer behind. I can understand if you want us to move along faster but customers would definitely appreciate a polite request instead of a sneer comment. It would be good that owners take in both positive and negative feedbacks and understand what happened instead of jumping into defense. In any case, the loss is not ours."
the curry puffs are very delicious an full of fillings. The breakfast are very good! Highly recommended!
"I've tried a lot of curry puffs in Singapore and Soon Soon is one of the best by far. Both the rich curry filling and the thin flaky pastry are faultless, really delicious!"
"Puffs were good - tried the curry chicken and Otah ones. Went well with the coffee and tea we had. The toast was however a little too soft and soggy by the time we bit into it, although the kaya and butter combination was well balanced and not overly sweet."
My favourite nasi lemak. love the sambal
"Best curry puff ever! Better than Tip Top, Old Chan Kee...."
Stumbled onto soon soon while walking around. I didn't expect the curry puff to be so delicious. We will definitely come back again.
The place is run by a lovely couple - always warm and friendly. Of course the food is great too! You won't be disappointed.
"have never tried the curry puffs (no opportunity) but the regular kaya toast breakfast set is surprisingly nice. kaya toast is soft and tasty, eggs are near perfect and tea is nice and sweet.  staff is usually friendly and warm (will ask if you'd like them to break open the eggs for you) will eat breakfast here whenever I'm in the area"
Best I've ever had
"Nice plump curry puffs with generous filling of chicken, egg, potatoes, all cooked in delicious curry gravy that's not too spicy. Pastry is flaky and crispy too. Perfect with their coffee or tea "
"Friendly owners.

Must try chee cheong fun, nasi lemak, and curry puffs.

Definitely worth going."
Nice curry puff
"Nice n crispy curry puffs. Crispy on the outside, juicy inside. Gotta work on the coffee tho. Rather pricy too..."
"Finally got to buy their curry puffs! They sell out early, happened to be here on a weekday early morning. Takeaway a few of their recommended curry chicken puffs for my family.

Oh god, hands down the best curry puff we had in a long while! Loved by grandma and helper, both commented this is different and very good compared to what they usually had outside.

Keep up the good taste! Will drop by for takeaways again soon~ "
"Best curry puff!!
Even tourist guides take their tours here to try the local specialties."
Fabulous Curry Puff loaded with ingredients
"Food is good, staff efficient and friendly."
Cleaned n nice food
" Chi Ming Ka Li Jiao,Xian Hen Xin Xian,Geng Ai Liu Lian Jiao,Fei Chang Ke Kou,Dian Zhu Hen Yong Xin Peng Zhi,Qie Dai Ke You Li. 
Curry puff is delicious,  shopkeeper carefully baked, the filling is very fresh. I real love durian puff . Entertaining customers are very polite and friendly.
 Au curry bouffee est delicieux, commercant soigneusement prepare.  Client d'accueil poli,  le remplissage est tres frais. "
"Best curry puff in Singapore at the moment. The skin is crispy and light. No nasty oil smell. The stuffing is generous and filled with REAL curry, not some curry paste. All they need to do is sprinkle some Instagram fairy dust and they will go viral."
Super curry puffs. V flaky crusts. Tried the durian puffs recently and they were delicious too
Friendly owners. Amazing curry puff!  Good coffee!
"Small and cool local Singaporean coffeeshop. Has aircon. Has local delights like chee chong fun, Kaya toast, mee Siam, nasi lemak!"
Good flaky layered curry puff skin. Rich fillings and great taste. Value for money. And mee siam is great too.
"One of the best curry puffs in Singapore, or should I say the best curry puffs I've found so far. The kaya toast + coffee set is also nice. Yakun and Killiney are no match."
"curry puffs are sucks and expensive, don't know why they dare to say they are the best in the East area!"
Always enjoy going back for Chicken Curry puff and Ice coffee.
"Poor service , lousy food, I will not visit anymore"
nice curry puff and chicken curry rice
"Nice, clean environment. Love the crisp curry puffs with tasty filling. Mee siam with gravy an acquired taste but decent enough. Chee Cheong Fun good."
"Pleasantly said, this will be the last patronage with this business. Unpleasant experienced provided by the boss man himself when just a query on what is the flavor of the curry puff in the shelf.

Since decided to try as have not been there quite sometimes back. Flavor has deteoriated and no longer as good as the previous year. For the price of each puff sold, there are much better curry puffs in the nearby vicinity that is much worthy probably for a better price too.

Was seated outside the entrance and had also noticed when the lady boss was serving a customer who just bought a sesame ball. The lady boss packed into a plastic and just throw it onto the table top.  When she was returning the change to the customer, it was obviously in a not thankful manner.

Kind words for business owner, branding is important though, however to sustain with such non-welcoming attitude, it shall all relates to service attitude. Challening for your sustainability in this current market conditions especially the trend that is taking place along this whole stretch of shophouses. Nonetheless, hope you grow well!!

No PUN HERE THO!!

Since you had notices on additional 30cts for take away, and set is only applicable for dine-in, why not to consider including --> ""NO QUERIES ALLOWED AS NO ONE HERE IS HAPPY TO RESPOND"" & ""ONLY BIG ORDERS WILL BE ENTERTAINED"" this will save alot of unhappiness between customers and you as grouchy business owners."
"Old school authentic brewed coffee. Also serves various snacks like curry puff and steamed items eg chee Cheong fun, soon kueh"
Awesome Curry puff!!! The lady taking the orders is very friendly!!! Keep it up!!!
The crispy chicken rice with Curry is phenomenal.
Yummy Curry Puff!!!
Great place for a light meal or snacks. Must try if you like curry puffs.
Best curry puff in Singapore. Better than Old Chang Kee curry puffs as the filling is fresher and pastry on the outside is not too thick. I highly recommend the durian puff as well. Real durian used and taste heavenly!!
Lovely Chee Cheong fun. Silky.
Best curry puffs in Singapore hands down
It is a good place.
The curry puff is very nice. Better than those big brands like OCK.
Spoilt for choices
"My family and I stumbled upon this place and fate was kind. I can say Soon Soon Huat serves one of the best chicken curry puffs i have ever had.. The guy behind the counter (i assume he is the owner) was super friendly.. We tried different snacks they have and they all are very delicious..

We had:
Chicken curry puff
Durian puff
Custard puff
Otah puff
Carrot cake
Fish ball..

Very tasty staple drink as well, good for after noon tea or coffee time. .Then you can take a lovely stroll around the neighborhood. .Very charming part of Singapore. ."
"I find the staff here very nice and they serve a decent breakfast. They have macaroni soup as well.Never tried the Curry Puff, wonder if they are crispy?"
"Was passing by during afternoon break time, attracted by look of puff. Staff manning is good and gave good recommendation on food for take away. Tried Curry chicken puff, juicy curry with biteable chunk of chicken and egg slice. Custard puff with green dot on puff contains creamy custard which is just nice sweet, though smaller in size. All puff have crispy skins, price is reasonable. Too bad, sardine out of stock. Will try to drop in and maybe dine in next time to try other food."
"Good curry puff! Sardine puff is one of the must try.
Customised curry puffs for my daughter with egg allergic.
They remember well what we always have for our drinks too "
Nice food & coffee.
"Very rude lady boss at this place. We are living in Hong Kong and always though Singaporean eating places have much better service. This place service sucks big time. The lady boss was very rude and insisted for the set that we are ordering in with the coffee, we can't take away the curry puff, first time we heard this. Never mind. Then I ordered a coffee without sugar and she insisted that she heard Kopi C and refuse to change, insisting that the customer is wrong. Then she told us off saying that we are wrong and kept bringing up the fact that her shop does not do set with the curry puff takeaway although we already paid for it separately. This has already happened on TWO OCCASIONS. Very rude and nothing special about the curry puff so why the obnoxious attitude? STAY AWAY if you don't want to have a rude lady ruining your day. Food nothing special. Bad representative of Singapore service. WE WILL NEVER GO BACK."
Best chicken curry puff in Singapore! Fluffy puff pastry with juicy fillings.  The nasi leak and curry chicken chop were excellent. They have masteees the art of frying. Great friendly owners too!
Quite a nice place to have snacks and food. But hard to find the place.
Good coffee.
"Best curry puffs and other local favorites (Chee Cheong fun, yam cake) along east coast road. Friendly owners always make us welcome!"
"service is AMAZING everytime i go there to buy food they never fail to greet me with a smile
curry puffs are THE BOMB especially the chicken wings fam
SOON HUAT AH"
Friendly shop owners that always tries to make conversation and get to know their customers better. Their food is always fantastic and warm with fresh condiments and is sold a reasonable price. Love this place and would recommend /have recommeded to all my friends and family.
Amazing food but an even better service from the lovely people of soon huat. They are quick to help me when i need to buy something from them and they are always on top of their game. A must try when you are around the katong area !
Awesome curry puffs!
Great food. Love the simplicity
"Easily the best curry puff store.

The curry rice set is phenomenal too. 10/10 would recommend. Always come here during my lunch break"
"Along East Coast Road,  same side as the Katong Roman Catholic Church is located."
Really good coffee and curry puffs!
Freshly made
The female staff was very rude. She took our food before we could finish without asking us! She has a very very bad attitude!! Someone needs to teach her a lesson.
"Outstanding curry puffs with different varieties like sardine, otah and even durian! Also have other dishes including Chee Cheong Fun, yam cake, carrot cake, Mee Siam... Good for breakfast."
Very cosy and quiet on Sunday night.
"Condescending staff (the female). All I asked was whether the drinks in the set can be changed (usually it is to top up the price difference) and her curt answer was,"" it's all written down here"" (with the look saying,"" can't you read, you idiot""). To at least give a fair assessment, we went ahead to try the sets (which was the next dumb thing to do to waste $6.60) and we found the curry puff to be so so. The filling was pitiful and the crust thick. It was not even warm. Drinks were ok but nothing you can't get from any coffee shop.  Wonder what's the big deal. Nothing to try here. Move along, move along."
Exotic puff and good nasi lemak. Friendly start too.
Simple shop. Clean and quick in the morning
Nice traditional coffee and tea place. Great curry puff.
Great curry puffs and a lovely breakfast place :) good place to hang out if I'm the area. Although the grammar for what they've written on the walls should have been checked 
"This is our (my dad, husband and myself) usual coffee hangout place and it's one of the best. I came here so frequently until the boss even knew the type of coffee I always order beforehand. The boss is down to earth and service is excellent. Food especially the curry puff is a must try here. We simply love coming back here for some local coffee and food especially after a long vacation. Highly recommended."
Best curry puffs I've tried.
"Perfect curry puff with ""croissant"" layers :-)"
"Durian puff (top) - 2/5/17
BEWARE: You may end up eating uncountable durian puff."
"One of my favourite curry puffs in Singapore! The curry chicken puff has crispy thin crusts on the outside, and the curry is kept moist inside with bits of tender chicken meat and egg. They are really friendly people too!"
Best curry puffs. Moist inside crispy outside. Yum yum. Must try
"Chance upon this coffee shop style snack shop when parking near it along East Coast road. It's main specialty is curry puff. They are also selling sardine puff, fried stuff (yam cake, sesame ball, chicken wings), nasi lemak and mee siam etc. Tried the sardine puff and sesame ball, they are very tasty and fresh.  There wasn't many diners when I was there but apparently quite a number of customers ordered take out."
Grandma made good with curry puff but the price of rental maybe a stumbling block. Needs lots of support to taste their juicy curry puff enclosed in the crackling golden wrap.
"Ordered wanton noodles but was disappointed -- the noodles were broken or cut up and lacked flavor. The char siew was served cold, and when I asked the cook, he responded as if that was normal. Despite being hungry, I couldn't finish the meal. A really poor first experience."
"Taste awful, had one bite and dispost all. Too much ketchup, char siew had old porky smell and taste."
"I can't complain. The service was good. I got my level of spice and dark sauce. The noodles had a good bite. The dish looked nicely arranged, and the price is fair. Also, the stall is open in the morning, including Monday when other stalls are closed."
Great value WTMee; US$3 for a nice tasty wanton noodles with charsiew  very basic but good enough for the price...
This hawker centre has few stalls opened at 730 pm.  This wanton noodles is not QQ.  Qness is at 40 percent.  The two fried wantons was not crispy.  They did provide an almost finished mayonnaise though. 2 Soup wantons were okay.  The char siao is not very tasty.  Not very roasted at all.  The green chilli condiment is nice though. The food cost 4 SGD as at 10 May 2024.  Overall it was an average experience
"Horrible. Is the worst of all worse wanton noodles in my life. Tabao as there were not much options today and ate the food through trying to swallow (as i dont like to waste food) first time buying and.... never ever again even if it is selling at 50cents.
Dont patronise it guys, beyond words to describe the food."
"If there is a zero option, I would have give it to this store. Shameless stall owner who is stingy with the toppings and charged 10 cents for a small empty bowl. Don't patronise this store if you have other options."
"Mian haPu Tong kana,wantanYang gemitainayatuZhu Wen sitakedoZhong Shen gaanmaRu tutenakatutakana. "
"The worst wanton mee ever. Starting with the noodles texture. It's bad and you're practically eating flour. This use to be Pon Tian and it was fine, after it became this Soon soon soon, the new store owner just didn't bother to care about the quality of food."
"Yucks!  Don't bother - it has a weird taste- too oily... or starchy, noodles. It cooked properly, clumped up(see pic) ...blexxxchk"
Seriously the tiniest wan tan ever eaten. Why waste time wrapping the wonton with such microscopic meat filler? I can seriously conjure up a bigger booger from my nose! What a ripoff! They will go out of business soon soon soon!
"This was so bad! If anybody thinks that the most recent poor rating of 5 months ago might be too outdated, please allow me to dispel that notion by assuring that the quality is still sub-par.

I have not tasted noodles this bad in a long time, if not ever. Incredibly bland, and yet not so bland that you cannot make out the awful flavours that permeate your taste buds.

I can't believe that we have descended into a state where it is necessary to look at Google reviews just to eat hawker food. It used to be such that hawker food at least had a basic level of quality- that you didn't feel nauseated eating it."
"If you still try this after all the ratings and reviews given, you must be born really special. Specially slow. There are better ways to burn your money."
The taste is off
guess owners not interested in their business anymore to let it be in such a state. a disgrace to wtm
Just horrible. Noodles were a shade of neon red due to how much chilli was put inside. Abalone was served ice cold without blanching it.
I want to give zero star. This shop is a scam !!!!
Taste like eating plastic noodle. Cup Noodle taste better than this. Too bad don't have NEGATIVE 5 star.
Weird service and bad food. Was ordering halfway and the cashier started using her phone so I had to repeat my order. The wanton mee is SO BAD. It's ALL chilli and no flavour - so spicy I had to dip my noodle into the soup and even so its still too spicy. Worst wanton mee ever.
expensive yet disgusting duck is dry milo is diluted the lady preparation was so slow and unbothered
Fried stuff not fried properly...soggy junk
Pretty average
"I should have come in to read reviews before I decided to just have my late dinner.
Not only was the soup cold, there is a caterpillar in the soup. It means they didn't bother to wash their veg. The porridge is tasteless and the meat tastes so sheepish."
"Short Answer: No.
Just No.

Even if this is the only store open in this Hawker Center, I'd just recommend you to head to a nearby Fast-food chain to save your pellet.

Other 1* reviews just explains the food experience I've had."
"This has to be the worst Wanton noodle I've ever tasted. Such a disgrace!

Had the best chicken rice next to this stall. It wasn't filling enough so I went for Soon Soon Soon Wanton Noodle and it was a bad decision. Really bad decision. The noodle had no taste except for the chili, no salt, just bland. The Wanton uh maybe it's just fried Wanton skin with no meat, and it was cold. The vegetables, oh dear vegetables were just blanched and served. You can feel the staff are not interested to serve nor in the prep work.
Can't believe how it'll be if you take away.
Will never come back."
"WTM was ok.

Shop was dirty (dirty tables and no one wipes clean).

The lady taking order was so preoccupied with replying her date that she doesn't even notice us standing in front of the shop for almost 5 mins and didnt even hear the orders we made twice.

I would recommend you find your wtm at the nearby shops which taste better for cheaper."
"Delicious and nice.
Portion abit on the smaller side."
Will never come back again for their food.. wanton mee was not delicious.. vegetable was not presentable and its just boil caixin with fried onion.. i would rather walk afew mins down to eat kok kee wanton mee
The noodles are nice for the price but I could say not the porridge
"Horrible, no taste at all, throw away the whole packet immediately after the first tried"
"Feedback: female Chinese cook not attentive (must repeat order & forget to separate my soup), slow, wanton super small, Cha Siew not well roasted, looks pale and cut randomly (awkward shapes), soup taste mild & a little salty."
Newly opened and no patron. Now I know why. Food prepared by amateur staff. The food here is horrible. Wanton noodle has no wanton. My wife's bowl of wanton only has skin and no meat in it. I ate a few bites and left in disgust.
Wanton noodle stall not selling wontan
"I ordered for the second time a roasted pork and char siew rice.. What a horrific surprise. The portion was a third of the normal size (delivered on the first time, the day before). The meat was dry, nearly no sauce and the roasted pork, previously good was just some dry meat with a lot of cartilage. Not eatable. This is really dishonest to send such food for delivery, when you know that the customer is not in front of you and there is no way to reach you directly.
This is the last time I order. Really upsetting"
Do Not Order Delivery! Don't be fooled by their high reviews on Food Panda. Noodles are too spicy; char siew rice is sugary sweet like dessert (!). Horrible packaging
bland without taste. charsiew is very dry too
"Not worth your money, spend it elsewhere. Food is tasteless and wanton basically is just skin."
Nice noodle. The taste is just nice.
self made fishball and nice wanton.
"I ordered thigh chicken rice but ended up receiving mixed chicken meat instead. The chicken didn't look appetising at all. This isn't my first time patronising the stall, so I was quite disappointed. Unfortunately, I didn't take any photos of the chicken rice.

I've attached a screenshot of my credit card charge for reference. For privacy reasons, I've blocked out the date of my visit."
"Not only flavorful, but the portion of chicken was just right, plenty of meat to go with every bite of rice."
"Wanton Noodles, Dry ($4.50) - 6/10
The noodles were springy and thicker than usual, coated in a black soy sauce that had a slight sweetness. The char siew was lean and thinly sliced, but it lacked the tenderness and flavor to stand out. The wantons had smooth skins but were on the thicker side. A decent meal, but not one I'd return for.

Dumpling Soup ($5) - 7/10
The soup was delicious, with a clean, savory flavor, and 4 generously stuffed dumplings. Each of the four dumplings was filled with a flavorful mix of prawns and crunchy water chestnuts, offering a satisfying bite."
"Food is good here, compared to other tanjong rhu wanton mee. I like the noodles really springy no alkaline taste. Char siew of the leaner old school variety. Ordered dumpling soup today $5 for 4 pieces generously filled dumpling with prawn in every piece with a thin layer of skin really yummy. Don't really like this hawker here as many crows, hard to find seating and plates at tray return not cleared promptly."
"Busy wanton Mee stall at Marine Terrace Hawker Centre.

Was craving some nice wanton Mee and spotted this stall. Quick moving line. Opted for the $5.5 version wanton Mee with chilli.

Really springy noodles, generous ingredients such as bok choy, sliced pork, fried wantons and wantons. The chilli goes so well with the noodles, really liked it!"
"A decent bowl of wanton mee, not bad."
"noodles are al-dente and springy, sauces compliments well too. wontons were full of meat and skin doesn't taste alkaline-y as well.

char siew is just the regular cardboard char siew (added extra so lower your expectations if you're ordering a normal portioned bowl)."
"15/3/2023 - I ordered 2 sets of Dumpling Noodle (dry), delivered by Grab. But arrived was Wonton Noodle (dry). The difference in price of Dumpling and Wanton is $6.80 and $6.10 respectively.  I also requested for cutlery but not in the pack when food arrived
This is already the 2nd time within this month that they changed (intentionally or unintentionally) on my order. But the price is higher for dumpling and wanton. I wanted to rate/call the seller but no contact number disclosed.  Why like that???

From A Very Unhappy Customer"
Above average
Wanton noodles just tasted ok n nothing special.
Closed on tues and wed. Please note.
Yummy noodles q was long but service was fast n good
Nice wanton noddles
The dumplings are fat with ingredients and the noodles are springy with no trace of alkaline
Thumbs up for the food n pricing.. but be patient.. waited 25mins for fries only.. avoid peak
It is not 24 hours as stated in google it only until 10:30. Travel all the way from the east.
"Highly recommended . Affordable, delicious, great chicken chop experience.  Very friendly owners."
"Chicken chop already cooking... understand as need to prepare for crowd but at 6pm is not crowded at all. Soft French Fries and dark in color ... could it be due to re-use  oil?!?!
Used to be good..."
"Disappointed! Ordered their chicken chop take away, ended up when I reached home then realized it only came with baked beans and chicken!

Where's the fries and coleslaw?
If I knew they changed the side dishes, I wouldn't have order. Waste time!

Or did they do it on purpose? If that was the case, it was very dishonest!"
"Ordered fish and chips. Fish is slightly salty but it is crispy. Overall, good meal for $6.50"
"pls take note baked rice picture was misleading, looked like mozerella cheese but it was simply square cheese, disappointing"
"Disappointed and unethical! Ordered chicken cutlet rice takeaway and when I reached home, I realised it only comes with chicken and baked beans with missing fries/coleslaw! Completely different from their menu! My family had the same bad experience before and we will not buy from them anymore! I notice this is not the first time and other customers had feedback the same!"
Love their Chicken baked rice so much it taste so damm good have been a returning customer since 2018 although not regular but if I happen to be in Admiralty I'll always come for this 
"Absolutely love the western food here at kampung admiralty hawker level 2. Pictured is the chicken chop spaghetti. The chicken chop here is my favourite, very lean and tender meat. I usually order the breaded fish and chips as well. The mains with spaghetti and chips(fries) are great, though the rice is ordinary. The young owners are very friendly as well, great service overall."
Generous portion at really affordable prices. The chicken chop we ordered cost us less than $6. Would definitely come back again
"Chi Liao Ji Nian,Yi Duan Shi Jian Mei Lai,Jin Tian Hui Lai Chi Huan Shi Hen Hao Chi.
Li Mian Gong Zuo De Xian Sheng Xiao Jie Du Hen You Shan."
very friendly uncle owner..cool guy
Boss is being extra sweet. Can see that he is really passionate about his food 
"The kind of food that makes you happy when you received your order. Value for money!! $8 for fish and fries. Freshly cooked, crispy, fragrant and favourful. Nice presentation and great service attitude like they really value your business."
"Western food gem in homeland hawker centre. 3rd generation since 1976. Tried pork chop, chicken chop and fish and chips. Very well cooked and reasonable priced at 8 bucks only. comes with lots of fries and coleslaw."
The chicken chop was perfectly grilled just that it is a bit too salty.

Will not visit again. The spaghetti is not nice and the coleslaw is the WORSE I have ever eaten. How can they get a queue for such standard is beyond me.
"Stumbled upon this old-school western gem in Marine Parade Hawker Centre. The chicken chop ($7.50) was a tad underseasoned but well seared, pairing nicely with crispy fries and baked beans. Topped up for some aglio olio ($1.50) and it was a decent addition. Generous portions, friendly service, and just a 10-minute wait at 8pm on a PH eve. A hearty meal that's worth a repeat visit!"
"Overall: If you're looking for a delicious, affordable, and satisfying pork chop, Tip Top Western Food is a must-try.  It's a hidden gem within the hawker centre, offering a taste of quality that belies its humble setting.
Price affordable, friendly service and food was good encompassing old school taste."
"Excellent service! Food is nice and cooked to your request, e.g. medium rare for steak
I specially like the coleslaw."
Very friendly and polite. Nice tasting chicken chop
"The coleslaw was one of the better ones in my opinion, I can still taste the cabbage instead of the flavours being drowned by the sauce.
The fries were fresh, as they should be, and the chicken chop was not dry.
If only the brown sauce was richer, deeper in flavour."
"Food were yummy...we ordered 1 chicken spaghetti 1 cheese fries
The servings were generous
Stall owner friendly"
"The best thing I can say about this place is this: My wife and I don't come here very often because we live far away, but when we do - Ponytail Uncle makes us feel like regulars. Good food and good vibes"
Excellent value for money and v kind and friendly proprietor
"The food here doesn't disappoint. Today's fish and chips were no exception. Besides the food, the staff were friendly and service was efficient and orderly.

The fish is tender but not too fragile, with a crispy crust of just the right thickness. Fries were not too salty and the coleslaw was okay for me, though some would say it is chopped too finely.

Accessibility to Marine Parade Food Centre has also increased with the opening of TEL4. In fact, Marine Parade Station Exit 1 leads (literally) right to the food centre."
Friendly Uncle with Pony Tail who gives extra fries and remembers me even after not being back for half a year. Food is crispy and Hot.
"Ingredients are always fresh and delicious. It takes 15 minutes after ordering, but it's worth it. Uncle is very kind"
Must try. Even if I have to travel from the west from Bukit Merah (thank god now have TEL) to Marine Parade for a hearty chicken chop meal.
"Served with a smile, quality of meat was good and inexpensive.
Will be back for more (and I live in the West)!"
"Huge quantity, wow! At $7.50, the chicken cutlet item blows many other similar stalls out of the water with its price point.

It was just sad the coleslaw was tad too bland to my liking and the fries, although decent, weren't quite enough to make it memorable. The saving grace was the chicken cutlet itself. But I won't complain any further considering the price point was something to come back to.

I'd still recommend it! "
"Offers a range of good and value western food for 3 generations since 1976 now helmed by young culinary school graduate, Darelle Tng."
"Visited on a Friday evening.  Surprised its not too crowded at the hawker centre.  Serving was pretty fast,  staff/owner who attended to us were friendly and patience.  Most importantly,  the foods was good. Prices was reasonable. For the price,  the serving was big. Good enough. Will revisit for another meal if we are passby Marine Parade."
Decent western food
Simply THE BEST!!
"Ordered aglio olio with prawn!
Very affordable with big portion. Abit underwhelming that the pasta was over cooked.

Fragrant when served, got gelat after a few mouths because it's super oily, not sure if it's the oil used, but it's unlike the other aglio olio I have eaten...

But would wanna try their other dishes like chicken chop etc!!"
Strongly recommended to patronize. Excellent service and nice food with reasonable prices.
generous with cheese for their cheese fries
One of those very few old school style western food. Steak was good but didn't really like the sauce. Crispy Chicken was not bad.
"Friendly hawker! I tried the chicken alfredo, it was creamy but not too jelak. This is proper comfort food."
Stall has been here since i was a kid and parkway just opened. 3rd generation now operates this stall
"Had the $9.50 steak (medium) which was cooked to a medium but was alittle rubbery (prob due to the cut). Cannot complain though coz the steak portion was decent. Generous with the coleslaw and fries (tasted good and fresh). Overall 7/10 for me, could improve with abit more seasoning in coleslaw and steak."
"Located at the central of Marine Parade food centre. Tip top western food offers a range of economical western food. Ranging from chicken cutlet, grilled fish, steak, chicken wings, spring chicken, spaghetti, nuggets & fries. Food are freshly cooked when ordered. Server is courteous and polite.
Tried the steak, due to the uneven thickness the thinner side of the steak was dry, while the thicker side meat juices are retained. The fries & coleslaw given was a good amount, spread thin to give bigger portions impression. Overall, the steak was average, while the sauce on top need improvement. Thick gluey sauce with little salty taste doesn't gel with with the steak.
Parking is available around the food center, both open space & multi-storey carparks."
The chicken chop was good. Add $3 for a piece of pork chop that's quite tender. Don't accept CDC vouchers.
Great western food!
"Don't usually do food reviews but this has to be one of the best western around east side. From the mains (I ordered steak and chicken chop) to the sides( coleslaw are well prepared , fries are golden brown and crispy!) , highly recommended!"
"Being an Indian vegetarian, I didn't try the other dishes. And this review will be based on the vegetarian dish I ordered.
I ordered Cheese French Fries  and the quantity and quality of food was amazing. Though there was mayonnaise topping instead of cheese 
I found the price reasonable if I compare it with Macdonald's or some other popular restaurants."
"Amazing food, loved it so much, friendly service, got my order done so fast, no long waiting time, even on peak hours, the staff are friendly even we have special instruction orders, would highly recommend everyone to go here and try the food, affordable price, great taste.  loved it!"
The food here was good and the brothers working there always greet customer with a smile. i have tried their pork chop and chicken chop. The best one is chicken chop with decent size and i went there twice. Fries average but colesaw here is well made. Will come back again. Left picture is chicken chop and right picture is pork chop.
"Good food, great service"
Ordered 2 chicken cutlets and the serving size is huge for both the chicken and coleslaw! The wait was not too long (about 5 to 7 minutes) and the food was not too oily. Great Western option if craving for some fried food.
"Don't normally review food places I regularly go to but wanted to after I saw the reviews here.

This stall is popular because their portions are very value for money, the price is ok and the food is good!

Be prepared to wait as there's usually a long queue of people at the meal times so go early and don't need to wait so long.

So glad I have a western stall here and don't need to travel all the way to Old Airport.

This is 3rd generation hawkers who are very hardworking and tough."
Opens as and when they like at their marine parade branch. Wasted my trip more than 6 times just to find it closed. FB and any info related to their opening hours are also not updated/
Used to be good. However standards have dropped. Staff forgot my order. And they close on random days without notice. Should avoid!
"Compared with the last time, the standard has dropped. My last visit wasn't good and I have stopped coming for almost a year.  Visited yesterday at around 6.45 pm.
Too much oil and over grilled chicken. The French fries are over done.. so hard.
The two ladies were inattentive. One was smoking at the corner and the other was feeding a wild  cat. Not sure if she washed her food after that. Unfortunately they are not professional"
"Bland, cold and overcooked pasta/chicken. U can make better ones with prego bought from supermarkets..

Definitely not tip top in anyway"
The food is ok. But too salty and oily. Used to be very popular back in the days but standard dropped after being passed to the next gen.
"Needs to improve ..
Coleslaw is very dry and almost tasteless.
Fries too overcooked
Chicken chop is grilled prefect but the sauce is too salty.
You guys really need to try your own food before serving."
"Chicken Chop not bad 4/5
Price reasonable 5/5
Fries 2/5 , should put abit salt.
Coleslaw 1/5, it not cold
Mushroom source 4/5, to me not bad, abit sweet to but healty
Chili 4/5"
"Ordered a chicken chop which cost $6.50 at about 2.45pm yesterday. It was ready after about 5 min of waiting. The chop is hot with its sauce (mushroom?) and pepper scattered on it. The sauce is alright but not fantastic. The two sides of coleslaw and fries were also served hot (fries only) and amount is sufficient for me.

Do take into consideration I ordered my food after the peak lunch hours."
Not open on a Friday afternoon at 12pm with no notice.. tillers were half down... Disappointing...
"One of the very popular stall in Marine Parade that serves western food in the past. Understand that they are currently helmed by the third generation. Order the chicken and pork chop as well as the grill fish. All of the dishes we ordered were SGD$6.50 each. Each plate came with generous amount of fries and coleslaw.

Taste of food was acceptable but they were served cold. It feels like it has been sitting around for some time on the counter."
"Really did'nt enjoy the food. Food was oily and tasteless. I remember the old TIP TOP WESTERN to be very different from what i just had.
First and last."
Generous with the sauce but didn't find it really tasty.
Fish & chips was kinda disappointing
"Prepared to wait long, taste is so so and not something I will crave for. Only have one cook and the other 2 are helpers.  Will be better if they check with you if u are prepared to wait for more than 15 mins before taking the order."
Friendly staff. Tasty food. Fish melts in your mouth.
Decent mee pok in Woodlands/Marsiling area...good enough for BCM fix if around the area...
I had the laksa here. Cost $5. Broth was flavourful and portion was generous.
"Interesting to see dry koka noodles here, no very common at other bcm stalls. Tastes not bad but feel its a little too salty."
"The vegetarian food is very affordable, most are 3.5 and 4 sgd. the two ladies are so meticulous that it they are so slow. Anyway my in laws like their Nasi Lemak, mee rebus and chicken after eating there on two occasions. It is near the new TE mrt."
"The Mee Siam had a great balance of savory, tangy, and creamy flavors with a nice zesty kick. The Lontong was packed with ingredients like soft rice cakes, tender cabbage, and crispy tahu goreng. The gravy was lighter on coconut but still flavorful, offering a healthier twist while remaining satisfying. The portion sizes were generous, making it very value for money. Looking forward to trying the Mee Rebus next time (available on Thursday iirc), which I've heard great things about."
"Tasty and affordable vegetarian fare around marine parade. Tabaoed a portion of charsiew rice, and it's so gooood."
"Fully vegetarian. Glad to have this vegan/vegetarian option at this hawker center. You can get a meal for as low as $3.
Opens at 6am. Best come by 11am-12pm for lunch. Around 1pm the food is running low."
"Very tasty vegetarian foods.
The curry noodles was just right, not to spicy yet full of fresh veggies.
The bean curd is very fresh too.

Amazing service and delicious
"This is a traditional pancake (apam balik) place.  The stall only sells pancake, and I believe it is also halal.  When I was a child, one of my uncles made and sold pancake on a trishaw.  The pancake made by this uncle has the same feel as what my uncle used to make."
Really yummy peanut corn pancake.
Uncle is friendly and the pancake is nice.
Fast and delicious!
Nice and freshly made
Comfort food for me. Traditional taste. They also sell other flav and mix. Highly recommended.
Love the soft texture of the pancake.The peanut and corn fillings are enough to fill for an afternoon snack
Huge selection of different ingredients you can add to your pancakes. Both owners are friendly and welcoming!
Affordable with a wide variety of flavours!
Favourite and the best apam balik I can find in the north/west area. Small ones are $1+ per piece. Uncle and auntie are very friendly and really fast in preparing orders. Recommended flavour is Peanut + Corn!
Lovely old couple with never ending smile.
Best mee jian kueh / apam balik! So hard to find good ones nowadays. My favourite is with cheese or chocolate or coconut
Very generous with the fillings.
"I rmbr buying this whenever i'm otw to to work and now i miss it so much..this is the best apam balik i've had. All the fillings is very generous. I like most is peanut, chocolate and coconut. Yummy "
Very delicious n have a few choice to choose
Uncle has moved his stall from Old Marsiling Central to Marsiling Lane Food Centre.  Every piece starting from $1.

Best mala fried rice i ever tastes. The cutlet is also super good
"Delicious variety of fried rice! Chance upon while walking past the station.

Ordered the mala fried rice with XL chicken. Keep coming back."
"Chicken tastes great, rice is flavourful. Best eaten with chilli, recommended- I look forward to eating more from here. Give it a try"
"On Wednesday 15 January 2025, I had XL chicken cutlet egg fried rice set for my lunch when bought from Asian Food Street outlet at Woodlands MRT station before I ate it at Woodlands Temporary Bus Interchange, and I liked this meal as the XL chicken cutlet egg fried rice set tasted very delicious. Overall, the service provided to me was very good and I would love to try these other fried rice dishes (except Mala, Pork and Beef) like chicken sausage, prawn and garlic chicken chop from this outlet in the future."
Prices very high. SO much higher than any around
"1. Long tong from the Malay stall was above average! I wouldn't call myself a long tong connoisseur, but I've had it a couple times at other places that always left me disappointed with its watery soup. That was definitely not the case for this stall. The long tong was flavourful, sufficiently spicy with a kick, and the rice cakes were moist with a good bite.

2. The guy who served me was very friendly as well, even proactively suggested other dishes when I mentioned I was looking for meat and wanted something not fried.

Will return to try the other dishes if I'm nearby :)"
"Ordered signature noodle from Teochew noodle stall,
the broth taste good, only that it is not full as the display picture and missing the seaweed, nothing special for the noodle.."
Clean food court with many seats and good selection of stalls. Most food options are taste about average but priced reasonably.
"Wonderful food n clean environment
Have large selection of food"
"A decent place for food, not a lot of stalls, so will run out of options relatively fast. Nothing special, but a good place for food."
"The food court is ok.

Affordable and has all necessary options as a food court.  Typically I always get the satay and zi char here cos its one of the few better stores here. The malay food here is good as well with decent portions. Other stalls are ok.

(The picture is Chili Crab from the Zi Char stall)"
"Worst Economy Rice (cai fan)stall - avoid at all costs.
Service person don't know how to count and give correct change even had to give 3 tries to get the change correct. Bear in mind this is a young person."
The table stinks....I believe it was clean with wet cloth reused many times....I have to switch 3 tables to find one with less smell. Pls do something abt it....
Food not bad
All that you need from fast food to seafood and groceries tooooi
"Many varieties of good food here. Half of the stalls are opened 23hrs (1 hour washing), with a 24hrs FairPrice supermarket next to it."
Awesome support and friendly approch
Good fried food
"Lots of good food. Should try Indian shop Mutton curry, very nice."
Good variety of food to choose
"Big kopitiam, many stores available. Have another kopitiam in the same building (888 plaza) just 1 minute walk at the side. MSCP and bus stop right outside.

Many cuisine to choose from, heard from some vendors that they have been there for 10-20 years so its a great place for authentic local food!

Very happy to discover this old school gem!"
"Came to eat Laksa from Fuzhu Fu Zhu Wanton noodles store, it taste terrible to the extend that the noodle is still hard and the food are not fresh! There is even a strand of hair in the laksa, got to purchase another meal to fill my stomach. Avoid if you don't wish to spoil your appetite... Tasted worst so far"
Slightly above Average Kopitiam
Very nice restaurant for food

"Amazing service, amazing food, great ambience. Very affordable prices and it opens 24hours a day. The drinks there are great, all made with love."
"Char Kway Teow nis nice, sweet and not dry type..
Oyster and carrot cakes also not bad though their looks not that pleasing. Self service crispy pork lard not bad..
Only thing is plates seem a bit oily even on areas without food, not sure if due to handling or washing standard."
The uncle that cook like we customer owe him alot money HELLO THE BOSS THERE GO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT FOOD ALREADY SO BAD AND THE SELLER LIKE THIS YOU THINK WHAT
My fav go to place

"Dapao-ed food from Shun Xing Shao Kao.
Took away a portion of sambal sotong and sambal kang kong.

Verdict.
Taste:
Sambal sotong.
Sambal used is good. No doubt about that.
The sotong was not very fresh as it was a little mushy instead of being chewy.

Sambal kang kong
Kang kong was abit bland. Not much belanchan and sambal taste.

Price:
Price wise abit pricey considering the small portion and taste wasn't like awesome.
Sambal sotong is like $15 and the person still told me can feed 3 pax.
Kang kong is like $9.
Portion wise you can see my pictures.



If you're looking for better bbq in woodlands that actually taste better and more value for money.
There are other stalls.
Fu Lee seafood or KPT 515 which has value meals at $8.5 for a piece of stingray that was of decent size and egg and enough rice."
Kareoka here
"quite a variety of food options to choose from. the bbq fish and esp the Si Jiao Dou were great! ordered the half boiled cockles as well but it may be alil too bloody than what i usually had in other places. will inform them again next time. but it's good that their cockles were super huge, it was damn shiok to eat it.

the fried oysters was not bad too, quite crispy, tho it would be better if the flour is lesser as it was abit too thick.

satay was not bad too!"
Ice tea very nice but ice coffee no taste.
"Like all other food court, it has variety of stalls serving western, Chinese, indian and Malay food s."
Very brightly lit and windy but heat is still trapped in the eating area.
"Bidding goodbye to 2021 with family members for supper at our neighbourhood coffeeshop.

This place has majority of the local favourite dishes from all ethnic groups.

There are quite a few popular stores here, from char kway teow, hokkien prawn noodles and carrot cake, Ban Mian,muslim nasi padang, zi char and the all time Singaporean favourite pan fried stingray and etc.

The only downside about this place is that only two person per table allowed as they dont have tracetogether check-in and people monitoring."
A nice food court with great food
Both Indian and Malay Halal food here is good.
"Very bad service the cleaners are not really responsible.
Just for the sake of cleaning the table and still still dirty . Not a place to dine food NEA step in and take action them.
Cleaners not waring mask sitting and clearing the plates."
"Review only for Shun Xing Shao Kao BBQ stall:
If I could rate zero, I would.
Served foul smelling rotten plate of cockles. When we informed the lady, she said that's how it's being cooked and she can fully cook it for us once more which we agreed to.

Came back with fully cooked foul smelling rotten plate of cockles. And I say a plate of cockles because it wasn't just a piece or two (which she initially responded with a ""is it just one piece?"" when we told her it was spoiled). Totally made us question the plate of gong gong we unfortunately ordered from them too."
Come here to get mixed vegetable rice. Bean sprouts and curry chicken for $2.50. Same  but bigger portion compared to Kerk Kopitiam. See how big pieces their chicken and potato is? Their Bean sprouts comes with toufu too. Curry sauce sufficient.Yummy !
Neighborhood food but the western food & night dishes are to go for. Has a great amount of variety.

A wide variety of food stores!!
"I stay very near here. Been 8 years, but I think I came here eat less than 10times. Really nothing special. Just got something make you full.  The only acceptable is the Indian stall."
"Plenty of choices. Overall foods is quite nice, ban mian, poh piah, chicken rice, teo chew noodles, western, coffee and tea also nice~ but one thing i need to comment is the tray... always dirt and food stain on it..."
"I am reviewing a particular Malay food stall that is located next to an Indian one.  Not sure if the stall is titled Nurul Huda.  It is not about their food, rather the service provided by a lady in red tudung at the counter.

This incident happened today 9 Aug 2021 earlier at about 10am ish.  I was exasperated when my nephew recounted how he was treated by the lady mentioned.  We had been patronising this stall for about a year now.  Usually we opted for takeaway even during pre covid period.

Most times, thick gravy would penetrated through the brown packaging and sometimes rendered the food uneatable.  My nephew had asked to have sambal petai and sambal fish separated and to be packed in small plastic bags.  This has not been a problem before with other food servers.  We are even willing to pay if being asked.

However this lady was blatant.  She sighed in front of my nephew.  When asked to pack another order, she uttered 'Astashfirullah' which means God forgives to give the impression that it was a 'tall order or request'.  At the counter when my nephew was about to pay, she was being sarscatic.  She told her colleague it was tiring working at the counter.  All this comments was passed right in view of my nephew.

What was she thinking?  Just because my nephew didn't retaliate, that doesn't give her right to be rude.  Other patron after my nephew had ordered the same way with another server but was not treated fine.

Don't be afraid to cancel any order if being scorned the same way.  Don't let such behaviour get away scot free."
Many choices. I love the teochew noodle
No Good Crew auntie Head coffee
Please try teochew noodle.
Important pl. But still need improve

"half of the stalls owners are rude and take customers for granted.

my favorite stall is the fish soup, however always long queue, very deterent to buy.

the seafood let down my order twice. first it was mistaken for 'takeaway' order. I sat on the table and waited for almost half an hr, all the staffs can visually see that I'm there with my bf when the food is ready but they didn't do anything until I walked up to them and opened up packaged food in front of them to eat. the second time is ordered stir fried chicken and it came stir fried fish and the auntie kept pushing us to take the fish becusee it's already been cooked, not willing to replace with the correct order"
"Mixed rice stall food taste good and give big portion of food,  wanna tan Mee also very tasty,  alot of food to choose from"

Good place to have a quick affordable meals
The stall sell satay bee hoon contain two thin strain of cuttlefish and charge at $4.50. This is not the way to do business. I will not patronised this stall again. The coffee is good.
Variety of food is good and airy. Good place to relax with friends.
"Big, well developed and busy coffee shop with many stalls. The variety of food is great. The beer is too expensive though and I don't know why. A bottle of Tiger, which is usually $6.40 - $6.50 in other coffee shops and hawker centers, here is $7."
Foods are so so only
Great place to eat. Pricing reasonable.
"This place opens 24 hrs. A place to get nice food at any time. Budget, clear and clean place at the location just beat the main road so that you can catch from far. The food are nice, of the local delights."
Expensive for breakfast set of 2 eggs black coffee kosong and kaya toast $4.80
Very large coffee shop with lots of food variety to choose from.

The chicken from Western Food stall is having a diet.
Food is ok. But the most disgusting about this place is the yellow plastic chairs.
"Pretty convenient breakfast place with roti prata, Mee Siam and so on. It's also next to multiple ATMs and banks."
"Great place for supper as it opens 24 hours. Lots of different food options to choose from. The menus for each stall have all been recently changed. The food options stay the same, but the menu is bigger, newer and more trendy.

Do take note if you're ordering from the seafood stall, always remember to check price before ordering to prevent a surprise when billing."
"Tasty  Fried lung, Liver and vegetables  $5
Muslin food are usually a bit more expensive than others."
"Definitely one of the best if not the best nasi sambal goreng in sg. I grew up in marine terrace, so I had this since I was young which was 35-40 years ago (can't recall when I first had it. And i am on the wrong side of 40s now.. ). Now I am staying in the west side, and I gave tried many NSG all over sg, but I still go here every now and then to get my nasi sambal goreng fix.. too bad, now the kerepek is no longer available though.

Portion size is a lot. Good value for money.. The sambal sotong is very highly recommended.. and the nasi rawon is not bad too.

Me and family go to place for nasi sambal goreng."
Lontong way too sweet. Lemak tastes like sugar water
"I have tried the Lontong, Sambal Goreng
With Sotong, Rendang, I can say
"" Superb""...Better  to try it yourself.

- Mohd Azam"
Very good Lotong
Their lontong is average in taste.The mee siam is also average. Service is standard. Atmosphere is pleasant and ordinary.
"Had breakfast on 26/5/24, lontong was pretty standard but the sambal sotong was awesome! Highly recommended! I'll be back to try other dishes."
"Since childhood I have been eating here. From. Sengkang to Marine Terrace when visiting parents, a must go place. Best lontong and Nasi with sotong and coconut shavings. Love theor ikan bilis if available."
"Best lontong and nasi padang I have ever experienced. Friendly Salina & family will be there to greet the customers in the early mornings, except Monday. The sambal sotong and sambal is the best. Warong Wak Nakem at Marine Terrace"
TOP TOP TOP! My wife introduced to us their Nasi Sambal goreng sotong set. Their sotong are to die for! My wife used to live in Marine Parade so had this since she was young. Food still consistent as ever! Favourite!
"First time tried  the nasi rawan at this stall. The serving size is generous for $5. Chilli is hot! Tried cow lungs for the 1st time today and I'd say it's quite mild taste and spongy like, unlike other organ meats which tend to have stronger and gamey taste. Unfortunately the fried chicken wings was flat and bit cold probably cooked a while back."
"My most favorite halal stall and the most food dishes i like is Nasi Sambal Goreng Set & Nasi Rawon Set, order the fried chicken wings the flavour & texture are just perfect"
"Traditional malay food such as nasi sambal goreng,nasi jengangan and nasi rawon."
"Nice food, but stall owners have an attitude"
"Swop paru for tempeh. Looking at the generous amount, who would thought it cost $5 only. Sedap pulak tu. Customer service is good..."
Tradition kind of taste. Price very reasonable. Portion very generous. Recommended.
After 25 years my last visit. Today I decided to have breakfast there. However decided to pack snd eat at my own home. Greeted by staff there very friendly and chatty. Food not only good but delicious. Surprisingly maintained its flavours and quality over the years. Will definitely come by again when I am around the vicinity.
One of the best nasi rawon in singapore.. The sambal sotong is awesome.. The rawon gravy is savoury... Prepare for long queue..
"Awesome lontong!!

I can dare say the best in spore.

Generous portion! The veg, the rice cake,  very generous.

The gravy is not over powering with too much lemak yet not lacking in taste..

The sambal is just nice in its mixture of spiciness and sweetness.

Total cost of the lontong is only $3!! Where to find so  generous portion at that price?

I also added a serving of paru (lungs) and fried chicken wing..

Total cost: $5.20!!!
So cheap ah.
So sedap ah.

I sure come back again.. Even though i stay in the north.. I still come.."
"Not bad the food, nice.... come early. Long Q......"
Always good and consistent. Come here for local Malay dishes which is affordable and nice!
"Absolutely delicious! Every bite was bursting with flavor, perfectly cooked, and clearly made with care. A truly satisfying and memorable meal!"
Best Nasi Lemak in Woodlands
"Food taste very good better price also
Woodlands my fav lunch box this place"
Yummy and filling plate of nasi padang
The portion of their Mee Rebus is huge for a $4 meal!
Food is good. We odered the Nasi Lemak and Nasi Sambal Goreng for breakfast. Pricing is affordable. Stall owner very friendly. Will definitely come again.
"Ordered 4 times thru delivery app.
All 4 times I ate the same thing which is mee soto and lontong.Legit sedap.Keep it up guys! "
Tasty and reasonably priced food. Stall owners are very generous with their servings.
Been ordering from this place through Grabfood for many years but have not tried eating there. Finally decided to try it today because we love their food. We ordered the NSG Daging Rendang and Chicken. The food is soooo good as always. The dishes are fresh and you can see that the food prepared is clean! Do come and support!!
"Nasi Sambal Goreng $5
Generous amount of rice and sambal goreng. Comes with tempeh which is not easy to find nowadays.
Tasty and crispy 1.5x fried chicken wing. Decent bergedil. Chili is quite sweet, spicy and a little salty. Also comes with shredded onions(?) Rather salty though."
"sadly, this store is permanently closed"
"Update: came at 11am on Saturday. They ran out of nasi lemak had to settle for plain rice with Paru. Plain rice texture is not as good as lemak as it is more moist/wet. But others are still great. Although to be fair the chicken was not as crispy today.

Update: paid $6 for nasi lemak plus cow lung. Lung reminds me of gizzard which I am a fan of. $2 but large amount. This time round this given me ikan bilis and peanut. Super satisfying meal

Update: tried their sambal goreng. The rice is really inferior to nasi lemak. Will keep to nasi lemak plus another side.

Wanted to get sambal goreng but it was already sold out (b4 11am). So ordered nasi lemak instead for $4. Not sure if they ran out ikan bilis and cucumber as I was only served chicken and egg.

Godly
Fried chicken. Totally crispy and batter goes well with rice as well. Chicken is tender and juicy... Taste I actually can't tell much because of

Sambal chili. Spicy, at least zhong la but still can finish it without water. Don't mix if your tolerance level is low.

Pro
Rice was fragrance. Didn't taste the plain cos I mixed in the sambal.

Normal
Egg."
Not a bad Nasi lemak one of the better Nasi Padang in Canberra and Singapore it might be the best nasi lemak and nasi padang
"One of the best Nasi Lemak in Singapore! I felt that this is a gem hidden in Canberra-Sembawang area that not many people know about. I really love their Nasi Lemak, it taste like the ones you eat in Malaysia (rare to find in Singapore) and really well-seasoned chicken wings. The mee reebus is also very tasty. They close right after lunch hours during weekdays, so take note if you are coming here to eat!"
Power to the people..
"Food was marvellous. Plus point, the price for a nasi padang stall is cheap. The abang who serve is also nice guy"
The sambal that was packed with my nasi lemak is spoilt. And its just starting of the day.
"The nasi lemak is outstanding. The chicken and sambal is tasty. The sambal is not too spicy and not too sweet. The fried chicken was succulent and simple. The 'Kerak' was the stand out point. Its a substitute for anchioves i guess. And my dish was $6.50 with the add on paru sambal and 3 selar kuning.

The seller was also very kind. Wanted to treat my dish as they didnt have small change. But i managed to pay them back before i eat my dish.

Best in the north so far. You guys should give it a try!

Service 5/5
Taste 5/5
Value 5/5"
"This place is a gem. Affordable price, large food portion,very friendly people and food is delicious. Dont miss this shop! 100% recommended. Its very rare to find affordable, delicious and big food portion malay food nowadays."
"Best Nasi lemak northside! Used to be at Yishun industrial but moved to new location at Canberra. A die die must try for anyone who wants authentic and old style malay nasi padang, mee rebus and of course mee soto too!"
My family is over the moon when we found out that they open at 115 Canberra Walk!!!! Do visit them if u miss their Mee Soto sambal!
Amazing food but where did you move to?
Nasi lemak mantap 
"The best nasi lemak in Yishun, the fried chicken wing , crispy and juicy, flavourful also. Fragrant rice , just perfect . Sambal power spicy but not overpowering. Topped it with the paru sambal, bagedil and fried egg. Last you for hours at end! Breakfast for champions. Honestly , a lot of places in Singapore even Changi itself cannot hold a candle to this hidden gem ."
Very friendly people and the fd is great.
One of the best nasi lemak in sg !
Just ordered thru Grabfood. The lontong and sambal paru was delicious!
Very delicious nasi Sambal goreng!
"Cheap food, great customer service and very generous owner."
"Value for money. At least every time I order crispy fish or spring chicken.. everything comes piping hot

Love the mash potato N onion rings
If U love Belgian fries..they give U ALOT alot

8.50 for half spring chicken.. acceptable

And they close late so it's great for late night makan"
"Blk 80 Marine Parade central has a nice old school western fried rice stall. Love the har cheong gai chicken chop.

#friedrice
#harcheonggai"
"One of the best all-round Western food places, rivals some of the best restaurants around. Killer price point and amazing value for money."
Came here late at night. Food was fast and portions are generous for the price. Tasty as well and huge variety in their menu. Will recommend to any for a late night supper spot in the east
Food slaps la sial. I think it's frfr the spot. You know how they say knn what hidden gem hidden gem? I think this place is the legit hidden gem frfr.
"I counted more than 7 times, not once did the 2 Malaysian guys hand me my food in hand. On most occasions they just called me ""oi"" even, mistaking me for a foreigner. they didn't even attend to me while they drink their beer at the table even saying ""he's not going to buy food"" i overheard.

I gave myself a good 48 hours before leaving a review but, I was restless. after serving 6 years in the army and contributing to the community, i feel ashamed to be humiliated this way. as if I was the scum of this earth. I have never dug this deep to compel myself to write such a review but this seems like it needs to be. I am utterly disappointed and at a loss for words."
Every things ok except smoking rule in this coffee shop is not follow during my several visit. Will never visit again if possible.
"Shi Wu Nan Chi,Jie Qian Gui. Jue Dui Bu Hui Zai Hui Tou"
Order a steak for a small girl. I wasnt aware that the steak comes with sauce. It ended up with black pepper sauce which was too spicy for my daughter to eat. Would have been nice if staff would ask for my choice of sauce.
Western grills
This coffee shop has a lot of people smoking here  but the western food is nice
"fried rice orderd a few times because they have great wok hey taste... super smoky...

but past few times it seems to have dropped..."
"For the $9.50 price, the pork chop portion is too small, and the meat is very thin--about 0.4 cm in thickness. Simply disappointing. I've had better pork chops at other food courts for the same price."
"One of my favourite western meals around. The grills are done right, both portion of meat and side dishes are generous in their serving. Most importantly, pricing is very friendly to my pocket. Highly recommended."
Food was good in e past n prices reasonable. Lately? Prices n gone up a little n e portions r getting smaller. Ordered chicken chop that was sooooo thin
Wonderful food! The western empire makes some good portions
"Order food delivery from them and pleasantly surprised. Food taste good with fresh ingredients, and reasonable prices. Support!"
Liang noGe nitiyotutoGao ikanaa~ Can Nian!
"Food is great and opens until late night so it's a supper option!
Spicy hot marinara for those who like a kicker.
Otherwise their chicken chops won't go wrong for coffeeshop price."
very warm and welcoming atmosphere. Food was very good. Would recommend 
"Run by 2 young chap. Gd svs, Great portion & delicious. The chicken was very well seasoned from crispy skin to tender meat. Highly recommended"
A bright and airy ambience favoured for business lunches. Pasta dishes ate really good.
"Love this stall for nice sides to western meat, but the saltiness of chicken and fish can vary too much. The fish was too salty, and I skipped that. Now, the chicken also too salty on some days. Hope the chef will read this and do a taste test occasionally. I do want to visit this often."
Value for money grilled food. Love their grilled fish. They have imaginative delicious ways they cook their food. I am a regular.
I've had the grilled pork chop several times. The garlic chicken chop was so so cos the fried garlic tasted slightly bitter.
"Quality western food for an affordable price. A popular spot with a wider range of dishes compared to a usual coffeeshop western stall. What sets them apart is that is that they have seasonal dishes where they innovate on sauces, along with some more unusual dishes like the cereal fish which is actually quite tasty. Enjoyed the presentation on the plate as well, which gives the premium feel."
"Good service attitude, did not make any face when asked to pay using CDC. Had chicken cutlet and chicken chop, food is reasonably priced. Chicken was well seasoned, very flavorful. Coleslaw was creamy and rich, not runny. French fries unfortunately was a little dry but overall crispy and adequately salted. Hit the spot, very satisfied dinner."
"Cosy dining place
Even when it is crowded, it is still spacious to move around
The majority of stalls have staff that were friendly and smiley, especially the wanton stall
Waiting time is acceptable during lunchtime"
"Stall needs a little clean-up, but food is average.  Only thing going for this is the fact that it opens till 2 a.m."
"its good, ennf said lads"
"Tempted by the crispy fish at first but made concious decision to order the grilled fish with italian herb instead for healthier choice. U can choose 2 sides of your choice.
The fish taste really good on first bite,  but gets a bit too salthy for me subsequently. It is still good in my view.
Coleslaw deserves an absolute thumbs up. Onion rings is one of the best i have tasted. I would order it as a separate side the next time.
Overall, i am happy. Its a deserving 5 star for its food at a very reasonable price.
I do not expect much from atmosphere from a coffee shop but is relatively clean.
Overall, it am rating it 5 star. Highly recommend the onion rings. Must order."
"Good tasting food, generous portions and well priced. Open till late which is very convenient. Recommend the whole fried  spring chicken and carbonara."
Pretty decent standard for a coffee shop Western Food joint
Love the old style western food
"Love the salted egg crispy fish! The fish itself was nicely flaky, not the cheap frozen kind you normally get. It's tasty on its own, but with the side serving of liquid gold salted egg sauce, it just sent me to heaven! Will order again!"
I never want to leave. Pure skill. The chef clearly has a passion for great comfort food. I'll be stopping here a lot.
"My husband ate here and I watched him eat every bite and love it! Classic amazing food.
Typical hawker venue, don't come for the atmosphere, come for the food!!"
"Great taste, great portion!
U must order their fried rice, chicken chop and popcorn chicken when u patronise the stall

Atmosphere 2 star because it's located in coffeeshop"
Tried the food from the noodle club and the western empire! Shiok! Value for money too!
"Great choice of Western Grill
And good choices of sides"
"Bad serve of overcooked, yellow & unpalatable set of broccolis ....

How did the head chef let this platter go out beyond his hand to serve to customers ....

What a shame ! :-("
The food was so good
Excellent food at fair prices. Good portions.
"me and my friend ordered separately, received separate pagers, and my friend's pager started beeping first so he went to take his food, sat down and started eating. To my horror, they had mixed up my friend's order with mine, and claimed that they did not want to change my food because my friend took my order. terrible customer service."
"Massively underrated western food in the heartlands!

Tastes really good and priced reasonably. Highly recommend!"
"I come here at least once a week up to 3 times . The food is simply amazing, the sides are all good.  Veg is fresh, fries are nice. The mains are also amazing, always confused when I'm here cos all is good. Personal favourite is grill pork chop."
"We love coming here for value for money ribeye steaks! Only beef with this place is that they only accept cash payments..

// PayNow is perfect~ Thanks for letting us know."
"While coming back from East Coast Park, we explored this restaurant and in a short review it was worth it.
We ordered Spring Onion Egg Fried Rice and it was actually delicious. I would definitely recommend this if you love fried rice and okay to eat eggs.
The prices of all dishes were reasonable. Sharing few pictures that you might like to view.

Cons:
The only drawback was they were strictly accepting cash. Fortunately, I found an ATM opposite the restaurant itself."
Garlic chicken chop is the bomb
"I got the Pork Chop with Belgian Fries, Mash Potatoes and a Sweet Corn. The Pork Chop was absolutely amazing, great flavor and very tender. The fries were very well seasoned and crispy as well. The mash potato is nice and light, and has a buttery creaminess to it which I like. Sweet Corn tastes like a standard sweet corn. Probably would visit again"
"Seriously, will not dine there again!"
One of our favourite places to get our meal
"Consistently good Western Food! The Chicken Bits especially are a must try - perfectly fried and surprising quantity for the price, I will always order it as a side dish on top of anything else."
"The black pepper pork chop was delish, right amt of grillinh, pork chop taste was quute fesh, pepper sauce yum. very crispy fries and onions.

Already craving it though I had it a week ago"
"Nice, long wait. Aglio olio is spicy with what looks like sambal chili. Too spicy but nice."
Good pork chop grilled
Food was decent. Presentation looks good when having it at the coffeeshop.
"Very bad customer service, man serving was very rude to my mother. I wouldn't recommend this place even if the food is good."
Bao Yu Guo Hou De Jing Guan
Used to have really juicy & tender chicken whenever I ordered on foodpanda. However when I ordered twice this week both were really dry :( Probably hired new chef recently?
One of my favorite stalls in my neighborhood. Reasonably priced and food is very delicious. Regularly ate their pasta and I loved the way they prepared it
"Love the chicken nuggets and mushrooms soup.. Yummy 
In fact, most of the foods i tried.. I love them.. "
This is a western food joint in a coffee shop. Serve pretty good stuff from meat to pasta to rice bites.  moderate price
Very good 
Good portion at an affordable price. But fried rice was dry and disappointing. Not much taste to it. Chicken chop was nice but lacks flavour once again.
good food with generous sauce
"Good food, I liked their grilled chicken chop, western fried rice and beef burger."
Smokey steak served on a sizzling hot plate. I thought it wasn't too bad. At least the doneness was right.
First time buying from this stall. Tried the Terriyaki Grilled Chicken. Tasted delicious! Will buy again.
Went to the same outlet but at bedok. Food portion and prices very affordable. Would definitely come by to eat again!
love that it opens till 2am
"Ordered fried rice with pork chop and another fried rice with lamp chop. Overall taste of the fried rice was not too bad. The piece of lamp chop was really a small piece as compare to the pork chop.
The coffeeshop is located at the end if the 2 storey shophouse so make it quite cosy to have a western food."
"Don't understand the good reviews here. Ordered grab from them, the chicken was over fried, onion ring paper bag was torn into half and spilled all over . and no cutlery again despite me ordering a few times ."
"I like it! Restaurant style western food at coffeeshop prices. They close late, an additional plus for me. Will be back soon."
Good food n reasonable price
"Very good chicken chop. Grilled to perfection with the western wok hey. Tender inside too. Vast menu with a variety of sides to choose from. Delivery is good too with the container separating the chicken chop and sides to keep the sauce from mixing. Of course, this is not something my Australian professor will think as Western food."
"Love their salted egg chicken cutlet, been eating here for years"
Quality falls after 9pm. Not an extensive menu
Food portion is big and taste is good
Bu Cuo Chi
Cheap food good quality
Nice food worth mornin
"Tastes good, decent size and great value."
"We love the burgers here. Discovered this place during my cycling trips in the east a few months back. it was open till late.  But this week, I came for the western meal. Service was pretty fast. We ordered Chicken cutlet, Hawaiian Chicken and Italian Chicken.  We wiped out plates clean! There were many sides to choose from. from garden greens, to mash potatoes, fries and coleslaw, etc. Prices were decent too. 3 main dish for under $25! Good value! I will certainly visit again if I am around the neighborhood. It's not hard to find the place, just look out for the octopus sculpture infront of the coffee shop."
The price is reasonable for this kind of service and food. Nice chicken wings.
"Average coffee shop style of Western food stall. Quite popular here in this neighborhood. The usual fare, like that of Chargrill or Aston's, before they moved uptown. The chicken meals are quite popular. Price is reasonable for the portion size"
Simple  and good western food! Will be back if I'm around the area!!
"Just another typical local ""western"" food joint. Taste for the price...  Basically, I've had better."
Good  Malaysia foods
"I love the shimeji mushroom pasta.made with spices, customized to be more spicy per request! Def worth trying !"
"Wa Really really creative Menu here, I had the hawaii grilled Chicken Chop,  Which taste Kinda healthy and not oily at all, Not Bad for its reasonable price, a good western stall to try. It is in side this Kopishop next to the Great Tradition chicken Rice (Restaurant Standard) stall."
"Food not too bad...for around the neighborhood for late hours supper, shop closes at 2am"
Value for money eating restaurant.
Ordered medium ribeye and disappointed. Almost tasteless and chewy like buffalo meat.
"Was seriously craving for fried chicken yesterday and saw on Grab Food that Western Empire was able to deliver in 30-45 mins. So I ordered a spring chicken set (that comes with 2 sides which i chose fried rice and coleslaw) for $10.90 excluding Grab delivery fee.

Food arrived hot within the 30-45 mins. Spring chicken was well marinated and fried to a nice crisp without being too oily. Coleslaw was yummy as well. It really satisfied my fried chicken cravings.

I had the other half of the spring chicken and fried rice for lunch the next day which i heated up. Fried rice was delicious as well!

Will definitely try more of their food soon!"
"One of the best western food in the area. Decently-priced and good portions. Particularly like their pasta (choose from tomato, aglio olio or cream) and fried rice."
"Surprisingly amazing taste for such a decent prices. The food is yummy, satisfying portions and fresh-taste ingredients."
"The grill pork Burger was really good, shiok !!"
Best western I have eaten
Sugar water products. Soy is so thin and just really cheap sugary soy bean byproducts. So bad. I am never going back again for such a long queue for this kind of poor quality. Ugh!
"The hawker home made their delicious Soya Bean Milk, tasted yummilicious. I have not tried their other menu desserts, must try in the future, but I love their Soya Bean Milk. I have been visiting them for decades.  Mmm mmm good."
"Very friendly owner. Speak to all customer with courteously and make small dad jokes.

Taro balls has no artificial colouring and taste good."
"I always order the non-sugar version with red bean  / red bean+ gingko nut. Though the soy flavor is not too pronounced, the whole dessert comes across as comforting. Service is really fast and portions are reasonable for the price"
$1.80 for a normal cup of Soya Drink
"Very nice sweet beancurd. It is very soft, smooth and tasted good."
Wanted to have a cold soya bean drink but they were not selling anything but gave away a free bowl of soya bean curd as it was the 3rd day of the lunar new year. It was piping hot and very smooth!
"Was a previous customer from their previous outlets. I usually buy soy milk and drink it the next day with no issues. Last night Bought 3x large soy bean milk and left it in the fridge overnight. Soy milk solidified after 7 hours into jelly, probably not very fresh quality. Disappointed"
"Ordered beancurd yam balls. Can't detect even 1% of yam. Such a scam, don't label tan balls when there isn't an ounce of yam ingredient in it. 1st and last time."
Interesting dessert. Buying was efficient
"Marine Parade Hawker Center outlet.

The aunty taking the order, I suppose is the outlet ""BOSS herself"" is rude. Shouting at everyone in the queue, when asking for their order. She was sarcastic with her remarks when I asked for more sugar syrup, that's uncalled for.

As for quality of food, the hot ""white fungus + peach gum"" dessert is not hot enough, some of the ingredients in it is cold (fridge cold).

This is a total bad experience for me in both service and food quality."
"The chef must have had a bad day today.

I ve been buying from the old airport road branch, which consistently upholds its food quality."
"Usually ordered with sugar. This round tried without sugar and it remained as nice.

In fact no need add sugar it's very tasty.

Enjoyed their silky smooth soya bean curb, even without sugar."
Pretty decent soya bean drink.
I tried the Soya Bean with Pearl and it cost 2 SGD for the small. I liked the pearl because of its chewiness and the soya bean looked like condensed milk but taste wise was good. It had the perfect ratio between soya bean milk and gula melaka. Would recommend!
"Warm, smooth and with just the right sweetness. Generous amount of ginkgo nuts. Delicious!"
Love it! Pure soya bean and not too sweet!
"Bought 3 containers from Marine Parade outlet, it turn sour after 5 hours, unlike we bought Whampoa soya bean from Clementi & seldom keep in the fridge, consume the same hour, totally disappointed."
"Soya milk a bit too watery and doesnt taste sweet at all.
Beancurd quite firm, doesnt break easily, less sweet, portion in one cup quite big. Not suitable for sweet tooth."
Local delicacy at reasonable prices.
Cheap and good! I thought it was a generous amount of Ginko nuts $2! Please don't change...
"The standard is good plus the amount of sugar is well moderated! The queue is not too long so its GOOD! However, could do with a little more friendly service like the outlet at Old Airport, which is hust as well patronised! All in all - STILL GOOD SO GO FOR IT!!!"
"Don't go... 1 veggie 1 meat $4.20.... feel like they anyhow count gonna report to CASE everytime i buy same thing DIFFERENT PRICE

Primz Bizhub woodland (building next beside only $3.4)"
Disappointed to say that having an extra empty bowl for sharing cost 10 cents
Clean and affordable food available
"Only a few stalls where the food is delicious, need to get more variety of food"
Fei Chang Xi Huan Zhe Ge Di Fang
"It is also known as Marsiling Mall Hawker Centre. Unexpectedly crowded during lunch & dinner hours. With patrons of all walks of lives, may it be working personnel, families or students, who flock there for their favourite ethnic dishes. Pretty good variety of food of affordable prices. Also a breezy, cool & relaxing environment to dine. Even just having a cup of afternoon tea with friends can make you feel great!"
it has good food served here! recommended chee cheong fun! cheng tng! lei cha! and the seafood soup!
"There is a old school dessert shop which is one of my favourite like ice kachang, chendol etc. There is also kaya+toast+half boiled eggs for breakfast. Lunch time is quite crowded there..."
"Hen Duo Bu Cuo De Mei Shi,Bu Fang Lai Shi Shi"
"Food quality and prices are reasonable. Do note that it costs additional 50cents to carry a tray, albeit refundable."
Yan ji seafood soup.  Damn good should try it when you here
Huge variety of local food. At very affordable prices
"Great place to dine in, food are at affordable prices"
Food here is more pricey that other parts of SG. A mystery to me..
Its ok but problem is open area. Birds will fly in.
More Choice of food
First been here but it was convenient
Easily the best hawker center in Woodlands/Marsiling...
Western stall food delicious and ok price.
Marsiling mall food ctr. Quite a variety of food available.
no malay stall only indian Muslim .
Nice and cheap food.
Nice and affordable food.
"Great place for great food, those who miss old woodlands central hawker centre, should go there still a number of Lao Zi Hao around."
Had lunch at this hawker ctr. Choices of halal food was  not to bad. Anyway ordered food from Beef King and it was satisfying.
New kebab shop..
"Our favour hawker center that serve various local gourmet. This hawker centre, also called Marsiling Mall, was built to relocate the shops and hawker stalls at old woodlands interchange hawker centre, which have been demolished for redevelopment. We can still find some of the old familiar stalls and shop here while some retired. The prices are affordable and could get crowded during meal time."
Di Fang Hen Kuan You Bu Re
"Many varieties of food, prices reasonable."
Dong Xi Bu Cuo!
"Cool place with sheltered parking.

Be there before 12pm to ensure that you can find a table"
Various foods - Indian food - Malay food - Chinese food -  - teh tarik - many many more - not looks but try them please.......
Great varieties of food to choose from but got lots of houseflies ..
Food normal
"Had Chinese Rojak recently at 01-15 Stall Name in Chinese Characters, they're selling Selling Rojak, Satay etc at Marsiling Mall Hawker Centre. The Rojak harko sauce was tasteless, the Yutiao was not toasted so it was totally soft kept many hours before cutting it to serve customers ! Other places Rojak the sauce is sweet sour and Yutiao is always toasted Crispy! Very hard to eat as Yutiao smelled like it was kept very long time! Threw it away ... Such a waste, Never eat here again!"
I think it is good laksa. The shop have other type of noodles.
Best Halal food in tuas
Ample parking and seating. Airy
"One of the best hawker centre in North.  Food here nice, variety selection. Seating area is windy and spacious .Personally think better than kampung Admiralty hawker. The later one is not a true hawker with only one coffee stall, no ventilation and not enough seat."
"New Hawker Ctr with mostly old stalls from the Woodlands Checkpoint Hawker Ctr. Most of the food here are still traditional local and served traditionally. Convenient, Clean and Cooling."
No parking allowed at the police station
"It is a 10 to 15 minutes walk away from the MRT (both Marsiling and Woodlands). Decent variety of food. Many of the stalls that were from the Woodlands Checkpoint area moved here after that place closed down. Tried the Yan Ji Seafood Stall seafood soup and the sesame chicken + yam rice from the bak kut teh stall beside.

Seafood soup was decent but had higher expectations because of the hype. It's also available on grabfood. The sesame chicken was so-so and the yam rice was unfortunately not as fragrant as I hoped it would be. Also had the bubble milk tea from Long Hua Cafe (first row of stalls, nearer to the mrt tracks). The white pearl was good.

Overall, good experience. Nice place to try local food. While the place was hot, there were many huge fans around and the heat was bearable even on a hot day.

PS: Return your tray for a 50 cents refund. Remember not to mix halal and non-halal food and take out the glass/porcelain items from your tray before you drop it off at the tray return stations situated around the hawker centre."
Great food
Great cheap food
"With 70 stalls to choose from, there is something for everyone. The hawker center is spacious with good ventilation."
The chicken rice stall is good! Good portion at affordable price. Tried their curry noodle and it was a pleasant surprise
Huge variety of hawker fare with hidden gems for you to uncover. The food are cheap and portions are generous!
Good food there. I love it
Alot of foods
Quite alot of seats and stalls to choose from
Newly opened food centre. Huge with high ceiling.  Plenty of delicious food options here.  Must try!
"Many nice food . Must try the fried carrot cake, roasted meat and Ah yi mee hoon kueh stall."
The spaces are too small n things are limited.
Ventilation is good & windy as using gigantic fan. Tray return system cost 50cents but refundable upon returning.Food pricing reasonable.
Lift slow yet crowded. Escalator going down faulty. Only few foodshops opened. Long queue.. maybe near New year eve.
Lots of stalls not operating. Stuffy at inner side of the hawker. Long queues.
Airy n good selection. Ample parking
"New place, additional dining options. Many former and familiar hawkers from the old Woodlands Centre migrated over, so the usual seafood soup, fried carrot cake etc. are a must try. Take note of the tray return policy: you need to rent a tray from the respective stall for 50 cents. After meal, return tray at the automated tray return station (place tray on platform, press the  on the LCD screen, tray will move by itself) then collect your 50 cents back from the coin return slot. Enjoy!"
"Had the stingray, super fresh and nice"
"Hawker shifted from old Woodlands Interchange.1st day of business 15/12/17. Soup is nice. Waiting for my favourite herbal soup stall (front row), which I came all e way from South, to start business in a week's time."
"Haven't start but first look is awesome

As per the update got 80 food counters and sheng siong super market"
"Good food, good service and good ambience! Although sometimes I need to wait a little longer but good food deserves that! 5 stars for it!"
"It tastes very nice, especially dry yong tau foo with signature Hakka noodles. The lady service is also very good and friendly. Thumbs up! Must try the signature dry yong tau foo!"
"Very good niang dou fu, pieces are big, fresh and tasty.  Keep up the good quality!"
The staffs serving us were really nice and friendly. The noodles are specially made - Hakka noodles. The soup was delicious and though it's pricey but the ingredients are fresh and the serving is large. Remember to use your FairPrice app to pay for discount
"The staff serving me was polite.

I didn't want any bittergourd, so he changed it for Mushrooms.

General the food was ok.

It has a different taste from the normal Yong Tau Fu I have eaten in elsewhere. With slight vinegar taste in all their items.

Noodles was good, but the minced pork was slightly too dry to my liking. (My favourite is still the Hakka Yong Tau Foo is the one in Syed Alwi Road).

Price is slightly high, but they do give better quality ingredients with large pieces."
Waited 17 minutes just to takeaway a bowl of Yong tau fu. What a joke
"The hokkien mee is mushy like dog food and I'm honestly surprised some reviewers can say ""it's one of the best"". Wow. Maybe they never eat hokkien mee before, or because their favourite influencer said this is nice so all just review blindly.

Taste is pathetic, pork lard is not crunchy, nothing stands out, in fact nothing can make it."
"This Char Kway Teow stall is a MUST-TRY if you're looking for a late-night supper spot! What's fantastic is that almost all the food stalls in this coffeeshop are open 24 hours, offering a huge variety of options.

But let's talk about the star of the show: their Char Kway Teow. Seriously, it's one of the best I've had in a long time. That beautiful ""wok hey"" flavor was definitely present, and the seasoning was spot on - perfectly savory.

Regarding some of the lower ratings I've seen, I can understand that the uncle running the stall might come across as a little blunt in his responses.

However, I personally didn't find anything offensive, and he was happy to customize my order (no cockles, no beansprouts) without any fuss. Plus, the cooking time was super quick - my plate was ready in just 5 minutes!

I'll definitely be back to try their CKT and explore the other dishes whenever I'm in the area.

One tip though: the drinks at the coffeeshop drink stall are a bit pricey at $1.90 per can. There's a 24-hour Fairprice right next door, so you might want to grab your drinks there instead to save a few bucks."
"I just bought 2 packets of hokkien prawn noodles from them ,it was so delicious,I really didn't knew that Woodlands area have such nice hokkien prawn noodles, "
"Open on grabfood until midnight, big portion and taste good"
"Honestly surprised by the past reviews, it was one of the top few HKM ive eaten, even featured on Overkill's Get Fed. I guess people are more likely to leave a review when they're upset while satisfied customers rarely say anything, so the negatives are overrepresented like this google review."
"Eating biscuits. All overcooked flour
$7 for this"
"Good idea to always check Google reviews before ordering something. This is avoidable, and is my own fault for subjecting myself to such ""food"". If you are smart you'll know what to do."
"Chu Shi Hen Cu Lu,Fu Wu Tai Du Ye Hen Chai,Er Qie Shi Wu Huan You Hen Duo Zhi Shui,Yi Dian Du Bu Hao Chi"
The older chef is very rude
"Whole family of chef super rude. Not just on one encounter, but multiple encounters, with different people somemore. And i am not the only one who says that too."
"On Friday 4 October 2024 (Children's Day), I bought steamed fried hokkien prawn noodle for my lunch at 888 Kopitiam in 888 Plaza after taking SMRT Buses Volvo B9TL Wright Eclipse Gemini 2 on service 900, and the fried hokkien prawn noodle tasted very delicious. Overall, the service provided to me was very good and I would love to try these delightful dishes from other Xin Fu Ji Local Delights outlets like the white carrot cake, black carrot cake and oyster omelette in the future."
More n more worse
"The chili chicken rice was pretty good. Fair warning though, the chili that they kindly placed in the corner was super spicy."
Food is good but smoky sometimes
Egg omelete rice is delicious. Large portion too
"One of our family's favourite Thai foods stalls at woodlands. Always follow the boss wherever they move. But the current location is the longest venue that we know. Try to avoid peak hours as the waiting time can be very long, more than 45mins. Half day on Wednesday till 3pm and closed on Thur & Fri or follow their FB for latest updates. Just realised they have a new menu, crab fried rice."
"Aug 2019: used to patronize this stall n even provided a 5 stars for the taste of the food. However, this stall has a very huge setback - think perhaps they're too good in their business n feel lower quantities orders doesn't reri make a difference to them.

Had encountered 3 times when we went there to tabao as usual n was being turned away cos they said they were busy preparing for big orders hence unable to do small orders (walk-in). I mean we went at your normal operating hours like 5+pm. Its not even your peak hours yet and we were being turned away just becos u had bigger orders from elsewhere.

Its not once but 03 times already, if u cannot provide ur business to your customers, u should at least gave a notice on your business page n not let your customer go in vain. Even though we work ard woodlands area, it is frustrating when the same ordeal happened too many times. Made us feel that u do not value our business at all. Due to all these happenings, our team had already stopped patronising your stall."
"Nice and big portion, but long waiting time (around 40mins) during lunch."
"One of the best Thai food places in the north. The prices are standard hawker prices.

The pad kra pao (minced meat rice with basil leaves) is 100% authentic and delicious. If I was blindfolded and someone told me it was from Bangkok, I would've believed them.

Tom yum soup was great too. A little more sour than the Thai version. The prawns are super fresh and delicious. It came half-peeled so it wasn't a big chore to peel them.

A solid recommendation to fix your Thai food cravings."
"Food
- OMG, one of the spiciest basil leaves minced pork rice with egg that I have eaten. Despite that, managed to eat down everything. Yummy! Ordered 2 plates, one egg is perfect runny, the other is not. Would return to try their other dishes.

Service
- Service is fast and uncle is friendly. Thai food business is the best in coffeeshop. Good that they have a buzzer. Note that only cash is accepted.

Atmosphere
- Rather small coffeeshop. Smoking corner occupies nearly half of the external region. Internal region has only 1 table. Toilet is clean.

Worth to revisit?
- Yes!"
"Thai food hidden in Woodlands
!!!!CASH ONLY, OFF DAY THURS AND FRIDAY!!!!

Hidden in a quiet kopitiam. can try if in the area

tomyum soup: many ingredients like emoji mushroom, button mushroom, huge chunks of chicken fillet chicken meat, but the best was the 3 big prawns. i was shocked. but for $7.50, i think the 3 big prawns warranted the price. can see in my pictures.
the prawns also had their shells peeled and it was very easy for me to eat.
tomyum was made from lots of spices and herbs (can see and taste the soup it's very grainy from all the spices used) it doesn't taste like those Ban mian stall kind, XIN YANG uses more herbs and spices.

downside is i wished my egg yolk was runnier but i never special request, next time i will ask.

ok can support this place but they don't have multiple cooks so be prepared to wait a while if orders pile up"
Nice Thai Cuisine
Tom yum and fried rice is fantastic.
Closes based on the owner's mood 
"Came here on 3 different occasions.

Prices have increased but the fried rice remains the one most worth your $6.50 due to its huge portion and rich wok-hei taste.

The basil chicken with rice was not as great and the portion was small. It was very oily and it is just drenched with dark sauce. As I also came during a peak hour, I waited for 25 minutes which was relatively quite long considering that the customers before me ordered the same dish. Although I suggest to cook in a bigger batch knowing that they have large orders, the taste and consistency was on point as they cooked each plate individually (provided you don't mind waiting)

Atmosphere of the food place is rather odd since it has both a no smoking and smoking zone sign at the same area. Not a 5 star in books but a decent shop to drop by in woodlands"
Food is very nice and authentic. Stall is ran by a couple and their son. Only cash is accepted.
"Only cash. No other payment.
Portion is fine with the price. No pad Thai.
Very normal, nothing unique."
Best thai food in the north!
"Food taste is delicious, portion is just nice.
But they only accept Cash payment.
Now most people don't carry cash already. Hopefully they could at least have a PayNow QR Code for customers as an option to pay."
"Amazing Tom Yum soup! The soup is packed with a punch, much more soup than most Tom Yum, which I like. At $7.5, ingredients quite generous and fresh, with 3 big prawns and lots of chicken meat."
"Awesome Nasi goreng here..
Best cook"
"Over the years it did gain popularity. Start coming here for Thai food during Circuit Breaker period when you can dine in for 2 pax.

Ordered Basil Pork, Tom Yum Tang Hoon and pineapple rice. Price went up slightly since September 2023 but remains affordable. 3 dishes for $19.50.

For those of you who cannot endure cigarettes smell, you might wanna takeaway."
Chilli chicken rice is honestly one of the best tasting plate of food I have ever had.
"Affordable servings of Thai food. Tomyam soup is very ""gao"", sufficient amount of spicy, sour & aromatic. Sad that they no longer sell green curry anymore. The fried rice has wok-hey taste as well, however it's a bit on the saltier side. Minced basil chicken is wonderful too, with rich taste of chilli and basil."
"No doubt it's tasty, but prices steadily going up. Quality wise has never been about the rice, some days the rice dry AF. If you order no.3, prepare to be like in a desert. I always order no.1, today the gravy is very little "
"Only the fried prawn omelette rice is recommended. However, the price had increased very much.  Now they even charge for the takeaway."
"Very nice chilli chicken best one ive ever eaten , but no paylah must use cash"
I partonize them since I was a student and love their Krup Pow. Used to be at Woodlands 883. Finally found them! I am so happy.
"Personal best Thai food I have eaten in SG.
They have been around Woodlands area for at least 20 years. Now stall cooking done by 2nd Gen and food cooked as good as his father."
"Taste is not bad, however not as authentic as original Thai food. As ingredient had change to meet lower cost & keep profit. Chilli chicken rice is my favorite. Tom Yam soup not bad but lack of fresh Thai herbs taste, prawn use was fresh. Been loyal customer over 10years for this stall."
Best basil pork rice
"Love the food, especially the sambal belacan."
"Long waiting time..... This is a simple no frill Thai food that can be found in a small coffee shop in Woodlands. The stall is operated by an uncle and his wife. Dishes serve are the usual standard fair such as Pad Thai, Thai fried rice, pineapple fried rice, Tom yam soup etc.

My recommendation will be the Tom yam soup, shrimp in fried egg rice and the pineapple rice. If you like it spicy, remember to ask for their chilli which gives some kick."
Very nice Thai Cuisine
"Affordable price, big portion"
Best thai food in the North! The chili is superb
Hidden gem great taste Thai food
"Satisfactory Thai food at an affordable price. We had their Vermicelli Salad, Tom Yum Soup and Fried chilli chicken rice with egg. They could definitely provide more ingredients to each dish, and I'm not talking about the expensive sort. More onions and tomato slices could be good for their vermicelli salad. We gobbled the food up and quite liked everything. However i felt totally parched after for the entire night which could be a result of their MSG used. Might want to sip lesser of that soup if you are as sensitive to MSG as I am."
"This hidden gem is tucked away in a quaint hdb estate in woodlands where human traffic is low. Quite inaccessible and can be difficult to find. The coffee shop is small with about 6 stalls and half of them not open on Sunday.

There was a malay food stall selling satay drink stall, roast meat stall, western food and this thai food stall.

Their menu is very limited, see attached photos. We ordered the basil chicken rice, thai fried rice and tom yum.

All were good. The red tom yum soup was sour and spicy with prawns and chicken breast meat. Basil chicken was really good and had a good spicy kick. Instead of minced chicken, there were chunks of tender chicken breast.

Do support them if you happen to be in the area."
Try Thai Fried Rice with Seafood and Fried Chilli Chicken with Egg.
The green chilli rice is really spicy. Quite yummy but a bit pricey. It's like Tze char price already.
Nice & affordable
"Pineapple rice is good! Fresh and juicy pineapple supplemented the dish well!

Tom yam soup is nice as well!"
"Service can be improved, but food is definitely worth coming again"
"Standard has dropped. I used to enjoy the Thai fried rice, but now the flavor is bland and the rice is soggy instead of grainy. The texture is not great too. What happened??"
Really hoped for better! But I guess if you're in the area it's ok. Tried quite a few dishes but really more like Chinese cooking flavour wise.
"Been patronizing them since 2003. I loved their fried rice , it was beautiful , the chilli is awesome , super hot. They moved several places over the years and until last year the Thai mother stopped cooking and handed over to son . Now the standard dropped so much that it's no longer worth coming all the way here to eat now . I miss their fried rice , back then it was really really good ."
"The food is nice but the coffeeshop environment is not great, suggest to order delivery or takeaway"
Thai fried rice is good. Too bad they dont sell green curry. I usually judge thai foods based on their green curry
"Good food, could be better service."
Tried Tom yum soup and pineapple fried rice! Really good. But the selection is really little. Wanted to order sides but not much choices
Nice but too little choice
I had a pretty tasty omelette prawn rice. A tad bit long waiting for the food but probably means it's popular 
Limited choice but one of the best authentic Thai food in the Woodlands area. Located opposite Republic Polytechnic. Be prepared to wait for your order during meal time as it is a usually a larger crowd ordering from the store.
Long queue. High msg. But taste good
Mei Ci Lai Du Chi Dao Mei Ren Zhao Jing
"Nice Thai food in Woodlands blk 806 #01-06 coffee shop - only few selected choices. Price is reasonable , if like basil chicken rice , come here to try if you are nearby ! Total cost - $18.60 to Tapo (:"
Good Thai food near neighborhood. Love the omelette rice served together with Tom yam soup. Perfect! . Food selection is limited. Hope to provide more Thai food selection in coming future.
"First time ordering today and I found out that the chilli chicken dish is a rendition of my favourite basil chicken rice. LOVE the massive amount of fiery kick from the chillies (ridiculous really, green chilli, red chilli and the kind of ayam penyet chilli all in 1 dish, but i love it). The Tom Yum Soup is also great with a good portion of meat. Chicken is also really tender, something you don't find everyday."
"Nice! Affordable price with great quality food, no surprise to expect some waiting time but worth for it"
"Best Thai food in woodlands area.. Must try their sea food fried rice.. No regret highly recommended, but  be able to wait 20mins at least.."
food taste good and authentic
"First time here and thoroughly enjoyed the food at this quaint coffeeshop. I had the tom yum soup and the mince pork with basil and rice.

The soup was thick like a broth and aromatic, quite different from the ones you usually have which are more watery like.

The fried minced pork with basil was awesome
the gravy enriched the entire rice dish and the basil was cooked to perfection. The entire construction was topped with a perfectly cooked fried egg with the warm yolks running down the rice and ingredients.

Delicious maak!"
Love their food .super yummy 
Over rated. Food are not make from scratch. Commercial Tomyum paste is used. Prawns are not fresh at all. Think it's frozen ones.
1st time here. Tucked in the middle of some HDB. Plenty of parking space. Your friendly neighborhood.
The food is really tasty and portion is quite a lot! Dabao back home and added a bit of fish sauce. Taste so much better! Had to wait awhile for the food for a sat lunch.
"Did another Sunday take away run from Xin Yang Thai Food, ordered 2 Tom Yam Soup, 1 Pineapple Rice, 1 Basil Pork Rice, 1 Thai Fried Rice and 1 Mango Salad. As always, the portions were generous, food quality unquestioned and the freshness (prawns) unmatched.
Am so glad that this little stall has been true to their craft and not lowered their standards in quantity and quality of their food.
Whole heartedly and gladly, I will highly recommend Xin Yang for a meal there or to do a take away.
Enjoy....."
Nice Thai food
Chill chicken rice is a must try!
"Tucked away in a small coffee shop, the Thai Omelette served here packs a punch, and costs only $5, which is much cheaper compared to most of the other Thai food places. Tom Yum soup is pretty thick and savoury too. The pineapple fried rice could have been slightly better as they are using sausages instead of actual chicken meat. Nonetheless, this meal was value for money and will come back again when I'm in the area."
"The food is good, but the price is too expensive in the coffee shop."
Great authentic Thai food
"Zhe Jia Tai Du Zhen De You Gou Chai,Chi Kan Kan You Bi Yao Wei Liao Chi Ren Shou Zhe Zhong Qi Mei ~"
food is great !
Nice & affordable food
Thai food cater for local tastes 
"The food is Super nice  especially the unique chilli source.

Recommended: Pineapple Fried Rice + Eggs "
Lao Ban Tai Du Bu Shi Hen Hao
Tom Yam soup is thick and flavour is full
"Cheap and delicious basil, fried chilli chicken and prawn omelette rice with egg. Try the Thai fried rice too."
"Authentic pineapple fried rice with generous portion of pineapple, pork floss and cashew nuts. Their belachan chilli adds a great spicy kick to it.
The fried chilli chicken with rice is another popular item, nice combination of flavors. Been buying from them for years and the food is always satisfying."
"Thai egg fried rice with 2 pcs prawn. At $5, this fried rice had wokhei and the eggs made it fragrant, went to add the sambal chili and more spring onions afterwards, pretty yummy lunch, worth waiting   the chilli stir fried chicken will be spicy for those who can't take much spice. But the chili paste that comes along with fried rice is a very good pairing with it, recommend to eat with the fried rice. Substantial portion, have been eating from this stall since close to a decade ago? "
Cheap and food Thai food. Recommend 
"Couldn't wait to try this, I've been hearing a lot about this stall. Not the easiest to find, it is located at the residential area under a HDB block. But nonetheless the food was authentic, loved the green curry but unfortunately heard it's being removed from the menu. The padthai was very generous in serving size and ingredients. Mango salad is another recommended item! But more on the sour side."
Great food at an affordable price! Highly recommend the fried rice and tom yum soup
"We had tom yum tang hoon and basil pork rice with a sunny side up. Both were affordably priced about $5 each and tasted good. The basil pork was a little spicy for me. The wait was a bit long though, probably because there were quite a number of takeaways. Would come again if I was in the area but not somewhere that I will come to eat specially."
Pad thai is really good for the price. A hidden gem
Thai food cook by thai 
very good food
very good food
"Dropped in for dinner. The fact that most patron at the coffee shop were having their Thai fix hinted at the quality of the food. And boy, I left very satisfied and a happy customer. Ordered the shrimp omelette rice, green curry, pineapple fried rice, basil minced pork rice and the Thai fried rice. Super impressed with the Thai fried rice. Nice wok hey to it and fragrant. Green curry is pretty goos and so are the rest. DELISH! Nice service by the uncle boss, who greets you with a smile and ready to oblige for requests for additional plates, cutleries, chilli sauce and more. Will definitely return for more. Tom Yum next!"
"Store owner is very friendly, dishes cooked well and it is very fast. definitely recommend going a 2nd time !"
"The food taste/standard seems to change after the young gentleman took over the wok.

Pad thai don't taste as yummy as before when Auntie is still cooking, Pineapple fried rice is equally bad as lesser yellow curry powder is used and it is noticeable. Wok-hei is not there too. Very disappointed. As a regular from 3 time a week, i trust my tastebulb. Please accept constructive criticism with an open mind too.

(fyi, pad thai I had is about 1mth ago, taste like char kuey tiao.  it was an afternoon and not so busy timing)"
Pineapple fried rice and Tom yam soup. Awesome
"their food are awesome, what I love best is Thai fried rice."
The fried rice portion is huge! 
"Wo Xi Huan Ta Men De Tai Guo Chao Fan Ji Qi Ta,Ta Men De La Jiao Jiang ~La Dan Hao Hao Chi E!"
The portions are generous and well cooked. The uncle taking order is also friendly and happy to customize dishes for your order. Have the fluffy omelette and stir fried chicken or padthai with work hei.
Nice Thai food at coffeeshop pricing.
"The real star here is the green chilli chicken rice, remember to request for the very potent chilli from uncle too"
Great Thai food with great value. The Pad thai especially took my taste buds on a trip!
Affordable and delicious Thai food in a simple setting
"Nice thai food,my favourite weekend food."
"Tasty thai food with large portions, wished my Pineapple fried rice came with prawns though."
"Chao Fan Hen Xiang,Tai Guo Suan La Tang Chao Bang!"
Nice and affordable with huge serving
"One of the stalls at the coffee shop. Their prices are on average $5, quite worth it for the portions given.

There wasn't much queue during lunchtime, I ordered fried rice and got it around 10mins after paying. The fried rice had egg, prawn and lean chicken meat, and I requested for no spring onions.

Most people ask for the chilli sauce so I had some placed at the side. The chilli was good, but not too good at eating spicy food so didn't add much to the rice.

Most patrons order the chilli chicken rice with an egg added in as well, looks very appetising but wasn't too sure if I could take the spice level so gave it a miss. If you love spicy food then you should give it a try."
"A stall in a small old coffee shop that's a hidden gem in Woodlands. The wait is often quite long, but the fried rice makes it all worthwhile."
Nice food! Lunch hour are often crowded with students here
Hao Chi Dao
Love their fried chill chicken rice!!! I can eat it every week and still long for it the next week
Always eat at this store when around the area. The uncle and aunty is friendly.
Unfriendly service. Food nothing to crow about. Won't go a 2nd time.
"Went with two other on 19 aug 2018 at around 5.30pm on a Sunday. There was not many people when I was there. No queue at there. Only about 1 people buying something every 15 mins. Ordered tom yam soup, omelette rice and fried chili chicken rice.

Omelette quite nice with shrimps but a bit salty.

Tom yam soup have some spice to it. Chicken was quite soft and the prawn was quite clean.

Fried chili chicken rice was quite nice. Chicken is soft and sauce is quite nice to eat. A bit spicy but it is fine. Rice is not sticky. Egg is fine.

Overall spent around 15 dollars and I think it is quite affordable at this price. Th amount of food they provide is also a lot. Enough dor one person to be very full. It is worth a try. Thank you."
"Super long wait, so many people ordering take away. Be prepared to wait for 30min during peak hours. That said, the quality of food, the price and the wait isn't really worth it. Not the most authentic Thai food, but the taste is more like local Chinese cooking. One uncle doing all the cooking...super long wait."
"Enjoyed the food here. Had prawn omelette wt rice,Tom yum soup and mango salad. So yummy"
Ask for Chilli
Best Thai food in woodlands area so far
"Zhe Li De Tai Shi Xiao Chao Bu Cuo,Kou Wei Gua He Wo. "
"Reasonable prices and great food, personal favourites are number 1 and the pineapple rice

This store is very popular at lunch times and dinner times, coffee shop doesn't have very large area of seating

Waiting times varies depending on number of customers"
Pay the price for the food. Overall is 
Food is good but waiting for the food is crazy.
Cheap & nice food. 
pineapple rice with sausages
food is nice and price is good too
"Delicious and reasonable price. My usual favourite is the pineapple fried rice, Tom yum soup is good too. Try to go before the peak hours if possible to avoid long waiting time."
The food is quite standard
"The uncle is friendly, food also very nice."
Pineapple rice has the wok hei. Very nice. But go easy if you have a sensitive throat.
"Food is ok, but half the dining tables are for smokers. Just not a very pleasant environment for dining"
Authentic Thai food. Chef cooked every order separately to ensure consistent taste.
"Affordable and nice food, not authentic Thai but taste marvelous."
I can come down and eat the thai style fried rice everyday anyday man !! Never sick of it since 3 years ago !!
"Nice Thai food, especially pad Thai, take note it's not open on Thursday."
Not much variety but tasty
Affordable and delicious Thai food hidden in Woodlands
Great food
Very delicious and authentic Thai food.
Food is nice
nice thai food
The best Thai Food located in a coffee shop. It offers great standard mouth watering dish for the budget peoples. Expect to wait 30mins or more during peak hours.
Relatively pricey compared to other options in the same coffee shop but decent tasting meals offered here
Food is affordable and of good quality !
Great authentic Thai food at economic price!
"Prices are affordable, food is great and authentic. Love it"
"Terrible tasteless everything this stall cooked. HKM taste like uncook without any ingredient of sauce in it
Char kway tiow super sticky oily
people don't mind waste money can give it a try if not agree."
"Good: open during CNY
Bad: charged $2 per packet of plain noodles, comes with only 1 small packet of chilli, tried to ask for more but rejected on the basis of ""1 packet is enough""."
We ordered the char kway teow & fried oyster in the evening. We went to this stall because we saw the nice photos of the CKT from the reviews. But it turned out to be a disappointment when the one we had was very dry and tasteless. The fried oyster was good but overall the CKT has either dropped its standard or it just happened to be horrible that day. Which is why I could only give it 2 stars.
Food is good but small portion.Only one thing is the hawker so kiashu think customer will runaway to pay them n keed demanding asking 
Unlike others Hokkien Mee this actually has 2 fresh prawns & visible sotong.  Taste wise is not too bad. Chilli seem to be on the sweet side though. Not traditional but taste good. No wok hei though. This plate is $4.50.
"Liked the char kway teow here. Piping hot, slightly moist and not too sweet. The cockles were topped on the CKT raw, just the way I like my cockles!

(Update: 14 Mar 22) Tried the fried oyster today. Nicely done! Eggs and tapioca batter were fried to a good crisp, and the oysters were fresh too! Wish they put more oysters though.

(Update: 16 Aug 24) They moved out of the coffeeshop and is now at Marsiling Mall. Ordered the Hokkien mee. Not bad and they are generous in giving two lime. They don't have pork lard though."
"A rich, savoury plate of Hokkien mee full of ingredients.  Unfortunately, the chilli is quite salty."
"Honestly lm not a picky guy. Can this store pls do a honest & sincere deal . I ordered large char kway teow $8.50 very little cockles worst of all 2 tiny slices of lap cheong . Also order large oyster omlette $12
l can even find a decent size oyster. Very frustrating."
"Char Kueh teow, fried mee hoon n hokkien mee.. tasty. Food still piping hot when delivered to me. Will order again"
Jie Qian Gong Dao. Shi Wu Hao Chi
Worth to try. Not recommended to dine in during night time. Many tables drink beers.
"One of the very few hokkien mee that has prawns, sotong and pork belly.."
Prefer the kway teow cooked by the wife.
"For those who like their hokkien parwn mee on the drier side this is for you. S$4:50 Plate was full with sotong and of course prawn. Gave two dollar sized calamansi which added citrus flavor when squeezed over the noodles. One of the better tasting prawn mee I have had. Value for money. Recommended. Down side, they only serve Hokkien prawn mee in the after noon and evening it's not available in the morning."
"Sells several types of noodles+ carrot cake ( Chai Tau Kueh ).All types are not bad, I especially like their Fried Hokkien Prawn Mee,It tastes good.All the prices are ok, common prices.It is very near to Marsiling Mrt Stn. There are HDB car parks behind and opposite the road.
Dated : 05/11/2017 ( Sunday ).
Updated : 03/11/2018 ( Saturday ).
Added 2 new photos ( View of stall & a plate of Fried Hokkien Prawn Noodle ( Chao Fu Jian Xia Mian )."
Great value $4 carrot cake with extra egg (50c) plus extra chili and chai poh  nice wok Hei   Pretty good
"The carrot cake(Chinese style one) was good. Ordered black. Never tried this before but since we have been looking for good carrot cake to eat after our drone flight, we decided to have a go. Those in the area who are interested in carrot cake should also give it a try. Would go back again to try white one.
The aunty works very fast."
"Always a crowd pleaser, this carrot cake comes with both black and white, called Othello.  Tastes good, though missing lard umami.  Highly recommended due to generous portion and nice service.  Chili could have more oomph, so if you want to taste chili, please ask for more.  Stall is usually manned single-handedly, so be patient as each order is done separately."
One of the best carrot cake I've had. Ordered the black one. Has little charred bits which I like.
"Hidden gem Char Kway Teow that has gone under the radar in this age of social media food blogs. Robust dark soy sauce with a fragant wok hey.

I was pleasantly surpised the first time buying it as the stall was manned by an elderly lady who fell asleep while seated during dinner time.

Afterwards, the consistent quality surprised me every time I bought the CKT till I decided to write this review!"
White Fried Carrot Cake -12/11/2022
"Packed their freshly cooked Black Carrot Cake home for dinner. The surface of the black carrot cake was crispy and the interior soft and very flavorful with black soya sauce and a tinge of spiciness. Every mouthful brought me closer to heaven. I was extremely satisfied. Will come back often from now on.

I enjoyed it so much I forgot to take a photo of the Black Carrot Cake before I completely finished every bit of it."
Unassuming store but white carrot cake was good!
"One of the better carrot cake stalls I've had in the east side..very crispy on the outside yet the carrot cake is super tender in the middle. Always wondered why they had such a long queue every morning..Talked to the owner and apparently they make their own Chili and oil (there's lard inside which isn't common nowadays since most hawkers fry to cut costs by using vegetable oil instead). And it's super affordable (starts at only $3) and portions are generous!!
This is a MUST try if you're in the area looking for a good breakfast in the mornings."
"Quick tip: Salmon costs $10
I ordered brown rice, chicken and spinach for $4.30. I think they were all cooked well, portions on the smaller side. However, I got attitude from one of the aunties. I asked her if the salmon was $4 since their menu said ""Fish - $4"" and she retorted loudly that ""it's $10!! Not $4! if $4 we don't need to work already!"" I thought it was a little uncalled for because I was simply asking as there was no sign that indicated salmon being $10 and isn't salmon a fish? Her attitude kinda spoilt my whole experience and I don't think the higher price of this stall justifies this treatment."
"Cai png also known as economic rice is something every hawker, coffeeshop, industrial canteen will have.

Do you have a favorite? Well I certainly do.

Located at Marine Parade hawker center, this is my favourite stall. Right at the corner of the hawker, it will make people travel all around singapore to eat this cai png.

Some may argue that it's expensive, but i feel it's worth it. Every dish on my plate is delicious."
"It's a bit challenging to comment on the pricing, as food costs have generally risen with inflation in recent years. At this stall, a meal consisting of 1 egg, 1 meat, and 1 sotong came to $8. While that's higher than the typical cai fan prices, it's still less than what some other reviews have reported (over $10). The taste was average--nothing particularly memorable. Overall, I'd rate it 2.5 out of 5."
"The dishes can range from excellent to terrible depending on what you order, but the prices are generally quite expensive for what one might expect from a typical caifan stall. ~ $6-7 for rice with 2 vegetables and 1 meat. If you go there on certain weekday evenings, the man who takes your orders can be rather sarcastic but funny."
Too pricey for economy rice.
The cai fan here tastes so good with sweet potato leaves / vegetables which usually can be found stir fry in zichar. Rice is also quite plentiful!
Food as expensive as western food but quality is mediocre. If you want to waste money come eat here. Will try to charge you as much as they can. Expensive ash.
2 meat 2 veg for $6.50. Really really expensive
is very pricey consider its located in a hawker center and yet Food is average
"Not sure if when food cost $11 is expensive or not since I seldom buy fish from a Vegetable rice stall. The rice me the sides were not hot, but since there was a long queue and it was already past 2pm, I decided to give it a try."
A little pricey for caifan at a hawker centre- but the ingredients and taste is good. Girl with the tattoo is quite feisty so be warned!
Ingredients are good and feel home made - the ngoh hiang has actual water chestnuts in it and the bergedil has good texture. I guess that's why it is a bit pricier than the average shop but definitely tastes better.
"I was recommended by a close friend of mine, and i came to this store with some skepticism. I ordered my usual cai png favs with the friendly assistance of the staff and was surprisingly pleased that the price was very reasonable. I found the food worth the price. i will be back again"
"Ordered at this stall some time back and I had a salmon, 2 veg and it comes up to $11. I got a shock when I heard $11 and never have i had a economical rice that's $11 before. They did not inform the price of the salmon before and as it's high up on the shelves i couldn't see the size of the slice of salmon. but that's ok because it's salmon.

Today I went to get an ala cart slice of cai por egg and the lady told me its $3 per slice. A triangular slice of omelette for $3. Didn't get it in the end and it reminded me once again why not to visit this stall.

The food didn't taste that great to justify the price and the queue during lunch time."
"Mushroom $4 Tofu $7.

Initially try to sell me more tofu for $12.. i said half.. then took out more than half and then charge me $7.

Mushrooms.. so little but minimum charge $4.

I will not be coming back here again.. $11 for vegetarian food.. and this is not even meat.

These 2 ladies try to overcharge like crazy! And not friendly at all.. Very pushy!

Beware."
I think they are not very honest with their prices. i don't think I will patronise this stall ever again. Food so so. I was charged $20 for 2 pack of rice and they said the sotong cost $6 which was like a spoonful of sotong!
The homemade wuxiang with water chestnuts really reminded me of what my grandmother used to make. Super worth it!
The food is tasty and not too salty. Taste like home cooked food! Ate lunch n dinner from there!(:
Over price and rude. Curry is a S good as water.
"2 vege 1 meat $4.5 ??
Expensive la !!
Food taste normal.
If tasted good, then definitely worth paying.
-3pts !!"
A lot of handmade food! Meat in the yong tau foo wasnt just the typical fish paste and go hiong had crunchy water chestnuts instead of turnip like at other places
"I used to eat this all the time!! My usual order was Ji Ding,koleicai (cabbage) and Zha Dan (potato ball). I've had it since I was a kid. I remember the uncle will shout ""Lai!""to hustle you to pick the next veggie. This shop was the pinnacle of caifan for me....

But as many reviewers have pointed out, it is not the same anymore... Today I was finally back in the area and ordered my usual... and boy was it different.

The Ji Ding used to be cut into perfectly springy and chewy bits but now it was in random odd sizes. The koleicai felt oilier.  The Zha Dan was less peppery. Even the rice tasted... different. Everything looks the same on the outside but it's not??? It doesn't taste bad, but I would only recommend if you haven't tried this store in its snaking queue heydays. Those who have tasted the original will feel some pain knowing it'll never be the same again.

So I'm not writing this to say boycott the store, boo, standard dropped... but this is my tribute to the best caifan I've ever known... it seems a few big name shops have left this hawker over the years, expectedly so as it's been a good 20-30 years... all good things must come to an end. It's been a good run!"
This stall has a brunch out nearby and it is still selling from morning till evening. Food is tasty and price is reasonable.
Don't ask for extra plate. They'll charge you 10 cents for it when the food your ordered was already close to 8 dollars per plate.
Decided to come early as there is always a long queue at this stall. Big variety of dishes as well as brown rice option. Definitely on the pricier side.
"Food is good, worth the price, owners are always super friendly"
"Omelet, cauliflower, cabbage and salmon Total $13.70
Salmon alone is $10"
"auntie is very nice and pretty. she's so youthful and full of energy! the food is very delicious, xing long never disappoints with their variety of scrumptious cooked food and i love every single dish i tried so far!"
24 Oct 2023: Wide choices of dishes available for economical rice and pricing are reasonable too. Queue can be pretty long but it moves quite fast.
Standard has dropped. Rice is not fully cooked. 
Food is fantastic it is worth the price! recommend trying it:)
"expensive, chicken and veg were overcooked. there are better and cheaper stalls here"
Food is bad...i should have eaten at Emmanuel Peranakan stall instead. That is a way way better can peng stall
The stall owner a lady very very rude....no appetiy to order or eat
Very route the staff....talking too Mich and no mood to eat also...very disappointed ..better won't going next time
Super sick cai fan. They make brown rice taste so goooood!
"Nothing worth talking at this place .
Moreover was charge 10cents for a small empty plate . Cleaners at this hawker sucks and the tray collection area are usually dirty and filthy . Sometimes the return tray collection point is not working  Rude staff"
"Not only rude just like most other reviewers, I got stomach upset after tried that food at around dinner time. I suspect the food was not fresh and stay on the shelves for extended period of time. It is true that this place popular but food quality and service is terrible. (Well, did I deserve good service from hawker stall?)"
"large variety of yummy dishes!! affordable, and the uncle is friendly too. worth the queue!"
"The stall owners were very rude which was noted by other reviewers too. I heard that the original owners sold away the stall. What a pity. My dish of 2 meat 2 Vege came up to $8 which was overpriced I feel.

Will not come back again. Try at your own risk."
So much varieties of dishes to choose from. Had my lunch at 2.30pm that's why no long queue. For 5 dishes and 2 Jumbo size porridge only $13. Every dishes fresh including the fish. Very worth it.
"The stall assistants are horribly rude, condescending and lack compassion.

One is this uncle in his 50s who wears his flashy pouch, who looked like an old-fashioned John Travolta wannabee but with bad fashion taste. There was an elderly lady who took some time to choose her foods. The lady had white hair and had trouble walking, so naturally she took time to choose her foods. He kept frowning at her and making faces. He also kept waving his hands at her to hurry her. If that bad-fashion-taste uncle is reading this, please have compassion on the elderly and pray that when you reach that age, people have compassion on you because you definitely have no compassion and patience for the elderly.

Another is this stout China woman in her 40s who looked like she is an extra from a Xena movie. She barks at people in a loud tone, and when you ask her to add just a little more rice for your food, she charges you 50 cents more. Calculating people like her have no place in Singapore.

I understand that this shop used to be run by a nice, kind and humble elderly lady who has since sold the shop. It's a pity that the new stallholders are arrogant, rude and lack basic manners. Maybe they should go for an EQ course before they sell food."
Lor mee is perfect. The pork belly is really really good.
Yummy lormee! love the fried fish and fried fish skin! The sauce is good too! Not too starchy and sticky. Definitely coming back! Happy to know a lormee store opens in the neighbourhood!
"totally understand why there's always a queue. lots of
umami flavours in all their dishes. damn good and shiok!"
"This is my favourite mixed vegetables rice stall. The curry chicken, beef rendang, otah, begedil, stewed mushrooms, cabbage and leek are my favourite dishes."
Quality and the taste of the food is average. Portion size of the veg and meat is very small. Paid 5$ for 3 veg and noodles. Not worth the money in my opinion. There are many better and tastier options in the vicinity.
owner is a great chemistry teacher
"Queues can get (xing) long here, especially during meal times. This mixed vegetable rice stall is on the pricey side -- a selection of 2 vegetables and 1 meat dish costs me $5.20. However, I've never been disappointed with any dish I've chosen. But with the exception of fish, never tried because pockets aren't deep enough. The original owners have moved to the row behind and a family member is running this now. Food quality still feels the same to me. Favourite dishes are the Beef Rendang and Otah."
The long queue got me intrigued so I joined it. Economy rice that's a bit pricey and the food wasn't too bad. Quite a big variety to choose from.
Love the fried chicken wing
After they reopen food don't taste the same. Also change people already.
A tad pricey but quality ok. Now run by family member. Former xing Long is now known as Emmanuel in the same hawker center...
"They recently reopened at the same location after the market renovations.   We love the ngoh hiang, with its slightly chunkier ingredients, as well as the fried bittergound with egg, french beans and otah, which some may find spicy.

The sweet and sour pork we had yesterday was not as good as remembered, though, and some portions were mushy.  We also miss their old dish of diced luncheon meat with peas fried in a tomato sauce.

Prices are still reasonable, and we paid $12 for two plates."
"3 big prawns, lots of pork patties, Thick slices of fish. Yummy for a 10 dollars portion."
Too expensive for a below average meal.... Worst still... the soup also give so little.... When asked for more soup the uncle will be annoyed and say no ... 10/10 DONT RECOMMEND
"Shi Wang,Gui Mei Guan Xi,Tang You Bu Shao gas Ying Gai Hen Gui Ba Lao Ban Mei Xia Ci Liao Yi Ci Bu Ru Yi Ci"
"Expensive, and the stall operators are quite impatient."
"Used to be one of my fav seafood soup stall but sadly not anymore. The amount of soup have shrunk to gravy portions. I don't even know if it can be called ""soup"" anymore. Evidently, all the ingredients here are above soup level...:(

Also, they use to give fresh Batang or similar. But what I got this time round was the horrible tasting pangasius cat fish fillet. I'm disappointed."
"$12.50 seafood soup, $8.80 trotter rice. Look at the pathetic amount of soup I was given. Was it worth the price? No."
"Ordered grouper fish soup and they gave me fish head. When I went back to ask them, they said you should have told me you don't want fish head. First time I ever heard such reasoning. Worst service. Last time I'm ordering from this stall."
"Soup of nostalgia. Grew up pestering my parents for this every other week. Cost might have increased and taste might have changed but this was still comfort soup for the soul. This was the medium bowl for $10.30 - prawns were fresh, minced meat still had that unique bite, and they are still so stingy with their rich broth. Love it!"
"Taste and Quality has been dropping year by year, while the price is increasing.
The minced meat has loss its fragrance, the soup are no longer pack a punch of flavorful and the prawns are no longer tiger prawns. Disappointed."
"So tasty and flavourful , but the waiting time is a bit long."
"Contrary to the one-star review, my experience with the stall was great, and honestly, the waiting time was acceptable even on weekends.

The soup was flavorful (a little salty, but acceptable). I would have appreciated more soup, as mentioned by the other reviewer. Although it is not cheap, seafood costs are expensive, so the pricing is reasonable.

I would definitely come back again for the soup."
"The waiting time is ridiculously long for non peak period! Time needed to cook a bowl of soup is more than 30 mins! For real! Tremendous drop in standard. No more next time!

It's not about pager. Your staff is not even at the cooking station. It's plain waiting. Track your staff.."
Rubbish attitude. U want pay money and see how rude they are how action they are. Go ahead.
Yummy seafood soup. 
The $8.8 is not worth it at all! The soup was half bowl and used dory fish and 2 prawns. They forget they are in Hawker Center 
"Ingredients not fresh and very salty soup and very long waiting time and poor service very disappointed and soup is so little
Very expensive too"
Tang Di Hen Nong Yu Xian Tian Sui Ran You Dian Xiao Gui Dan Shi Chi De Chu Zhen Cai Shi Liao Hao Chi 
"Soup is flavourful. At lot of meats with reasonable price 8.80. There are diff kind of fish, I choose the cheapest frozen fish with the smallest potion."
"I ate at a different outlet in old marsiling last time and the experience was good but the business is getting worse and worse after moving to marsiling mall. After ordering my food, I waited for a while but the buzzer still did not ring, then when I went to check(multiple times) they only kept asking for 5 more minutes, in the end I had to wait more than 30 minutes, because they kept making the food wrongly. In the end, the food did not even taste good. If they are going to take this long then they should let customers know in advance instead of making them wait and constantly saying ""saying 5 more minutes""."
Meat is a bit uncook despite sending it back to recook
Zai Xiao Fan Zhong Xin Lai Shuo Jie Ge Pian Gao!Fen Liang You Shao!Dan Shi Ni Wei Dao Huan Xing Ba!
As a regular I have seldom wrote anything. This is my comfort go to food stall. Good food for reasonable price.
Nice food & will come back again. Service was serve in good 
Seriously disappointed with their service. Been patronising them for years since the old Marsiling hawker. It's always when one gets popular their attitude changed. Spoil my day as it's the first meal and gotten this
"Really disappointed with the people there, gave so much time for 2 hours cannot even make one soup useless people working there"
Real flavor and true Singapore food
Tasty seafood soup!
Place to have sea food soup!!! 
"bad attitude. assume I wanted rice. when clarifying the costs, give bad attitude. when food took 10 mins more than advised (15), not willing to check when asked."
"Waited about 10 mins or so, at 5pm on a weekend. I ordered the small sized dory fish soup. Comes with chunks of meat, prawns and thick chunks of fish. Can tell that they used premium ingredients for this dish, including the soup. Even the meat chunks had mushrooms and sole fish powder. Very strong umami taste (which also means that one can feel jelat after a while). Will be good if they can add more tomatoes or Sichuan veg into the soup to cut the jelat-ness. Will also appreciate if more soup can be given. Overall, an above average dish!"
Food was good and the service provided by the staff was excellent.
"Have been eating this seafood soup since the old location until it moved here.

The standards have been maintained since then. The minced meat has this umami flavour to it that keeps u wanting for more, and every ingredient is fresh. Also, the soup is the highlight of the day to finish up the meal.

Do take note that there will be a queue during peak hours."
"Lovely seafood soup. Last I ate was before covid when they were still at woodlands centre hawker.

Yes indeed prices have gone up but it is up to individual to pay and enjoy if they want to.
Dont get why people must complain about the prices and attitude of the hawkers so much, just avoid if you dislike?
I faced no such bad attitude when I visited.

Totally enjoyed the freshest of ingredients and that umami seafood soup."
I feel it's not so nice anymore and the soup is thick but lack of the unami bust. Sad that this is the founder shop but there are other stall who have the similar soup that taste way better
"QC no.1 for the soup

Since not giving much soup, can reduce to smaller plastic container.

Help save the world."
Gosh the soup is very expensive $12.80 with rice and the batang fish slice got the fishy smell a real disappointment. And is my last time to patronise this stall !  Soup as for more portion . Need to paid extra . Soup only given half the bowl
"Everything is good but the service for today is bad, i asked for more red chili but this grey shirt staff uncle reply me , there is a lot of chilli inside the container and i told him i want fresh chili not chili that is very soft , so disappointed with this kind of service that this staff had reply me."
"Soup quite good actually and  big chunky meat but but...all spoiled by the unfriendly and rude attitude . They were not even busy when we ordering. Bad attitude will lose more customers eventually. Sorry even though the food is consider quite ok. But looking at the bad attitude and little soup which is essential for a SOUP dish. At super high price $8 and $0.80 rice for the cheapest small bowl for hawker price... it's not worthy at all...
The customer service poster is the real joke! Won't be back for sure..."
The food is overpriced and the staff taking order is extremely rude.
10/10 i wld eat this for bfast lunch & dinner if i could
"I don't understand why you call yourself a seafood soup stall when your soup is a pathetic half bowl only. The reason customer wants to eat a soup stall is because they crave for the soup, and it's not even enough to satisfy. The reasoning from the cook is that the soup becomes bland if added too much.

I have eaten the seafood soup from Blk 20 Marsiling lane hawker centre, and they always deliver a full bowl of umami seafood soup without fail. They also give plenty of ingredients compared to yan ji. Have stop eating from this stall after I found a better one at Blk 20 Marsiling lane."
Ordered the batang fish soup with rice minus the prawns.  I added fish.  Both fish and broth are delicious.   The downside was the amount of broth given was too little.
"Very delicous soup, even though on the lesser side, but explained by staff, so understandable. Soup was umami filled, making me want more and more. Trotter rice bowl was very worth it, better than others. Sauce was thick and delicious. Recommended to go at least once with family and friends. Staff was also quite friendly."
"Food portion was good, the pig trotter was tender and juicy. The seafood soup was very rich in flavour with a generous amount and wide variety of ingredients. Staff were nice and patient."
"The soup was very flavourful, each spoon made me yearn for more, the pig throtter was tender and soft, the skin was soft as well, compared to other stores. This set meal was one of the most worth buying for. Its a bang for your buck, highly recommend if you are in the area, staff was was very friendly and cheerful making the customer service excellent"
"Had this seafood soup many years ago when I was younger so today I tried it again. The taste is still so remarkable, very intense rich prawn flavour and the meatballs are so tasty. Sweetest prawns I have tasted in a prawn soup. Still does not disappoint. With how salty and the slightly costly price of the soup, it is a welcome treat to consider once a month. Good Soup"
A regular here.  Soup is on the less side but delicious. Hard to find similar soup with such broth. Their soup has always been on the lower side for many years. I guess it's expensive to cook such thick and nice broth. Prawns is always fresh.
Great food and amazing service.
"Taste was not what it used to be, feels like less thick.

Soup is also very little

Prawns are huge but not very fresh as the head is abit stale

Overall still a not bad meal"
Been quite some time since I came to this place to eat. Heard of many poor reviews on the quantity of soup provided. I did not touch a single spoon of soup to quantify roughly how much it is given. Estimated to be 3/4  of a small bowl which is already very small. Soup is extremely saltish I should have ate it together with the rice. Price wise. Totally not worth it
"Still a good quality bowl of seafood soup. As always, I ordered 2 bowls of small $8 seafood soup as the soup isn't sufficient. They moved from Woodlands to a coffee shop @ Blk 19 Marsiling Lane. Now they are at Marsiling Hawker Center. Prefer this north outlet to the one in the east.

2019: Soup is thick but it is too little for me hence I always ordered 2 bowls (S$6 each). My go-to place for good seafood soup. Generous and fresh portion of seafood."
"$8 basic SMALL bowl of seafood soup + $0.80 small bowl of rice. Taste of ingredients and soup quite nice.. a pity that the quantity is so little to justify the price in hawker centre. Quantity of soup is so little  that it's a little difficult to scoop, first time ordered soup item with so little soup ..

I asked how come the soup so little, the reply was it's like that, that's why I asked you order bigger size .. after finishing, I proceed to order other foods."
"Very bad experience with the boss or the staff attitude.

Food: 1/5  |  Service: 1/5  |  Atmosphere: 1/5"
"The soup is so little, but quite tasty. The minces meat ball is very tasty and flavorful. Prawn is fresh but the fish meat was so little. 3 small pcs only.. and the tomato is very raw, I prefer boil until soft.. the pork leg was tasty and sauce is quite good with white rices.  Overall is good but expensive."
"Came here 5-6 years ago and it was amazing. Tried this again in 2024 and it went down to below subpar levels. Also had a mosquito-looking bug at the bottom of my soup bowl (disgusting). Soup was blander than before. Disappointed cos it used to be a 5/5. Times are tougher so prices are expected to increase but at least have some integrity and maintain the quality. Prawns tasted super rubbery (I'm suspecting that these prawns are frozen for a very long time but I could be wrong)..?

5 Mar 2024 (reply to owner's reply):
Thanks for being open to feedback! I went at on 3 March, at about noon, a little past 12pm. It honestly would be nice to have fresh prawns or at least prawns that have been frozen for a very short period of time. The soup used to be extremely rich in flavor :-/ I hope it would return to its glory days because I really miss eating here  A lot of army days memories."
"Tried a few yanji around sg and adult feel this branch is the best. Prawn is fresh, soup is flavorful and homemade meat ball is nice."
"Food was simply splendid! I ordered the normal soup with rice which costed 8.80 which is quite good for a filled stomach. The soup is filled with umami flavour and definetely did not disappoint. The ingredients from the prawn to the minced pork to the fish blended together cohesively to form the perfect soup. The soup may be on the lesser side but most certainly packed a punch no other seafood soup could. The people there were quite welcoming and introduced me to the menu without a fuss. They were patient with me dispite me taking quite a while to order. Overall, this place takes my top 5."
If not happy then don't be in service line. I don't own you anything. Very rude when serving customers. Stay at home better
I am regular customer. Food with good quality but a bit pricey.
"It is always tasty but price is slightly steep from $8 normal size, include 2 prawns, 4 slices of fish, 2 quarter tomatoes and 3 minced meat with mushroom."
"Gui,You Bu Hao Chi"
"Taste good, but price went up to $7.50"
"Pitiful amount of soup, maybe don't do business if such miser."
Fantastic service! Prawn was very fresh and fish soup was so fragrant Hao Chi!
"Went there to eat yesterday and was pleasantly surprised by the service they provided! Service was quick and the staff were very friendly, especially the dashing young man who was serving. Will definitely be back to enjoy their top quality service and palatable food. 10/10 highly recommended."
"Strong and rich umami flavours. I recommend ordering the medium size bowl, large if you're hungry."
"amazing food, amazing service"
"Amazing food. Bought the $41 one and did not regret. The handsome young assistant had amazing service, hope to see him again;)"
The soup is excellent and the fish is very fresh-- the prawns are SO sweet and delicious! 10/10!!
legit bro if u dont go ur missing out
"went there and had an excellent experience! really enjoyed the 7.50 bowl of soup, very rich and flavourful!"
"Still as nice as before, given very little soup but is rich in taste! "
Order $13.50 sliced red grouper small. The sliced fish were make up bony parts. The soup taste a tad sourish. Not as flavourful as I tasted in the past. The standard really go downhill.
"Its been a while since I came and eat

A hawker place, yet the food price increased and the portion decrease tremendously. Very disappointed. No wonder no need to wait like previous already.

I wont eat again!"
Standard drop but overall still good.
"Zhe Jia Dian Gei De Tang Fei Chang Shao,Yao Qiu Jia Tang,Yuan Gong Shuo Mei You De Jia,Shi Zhe Yang De,Tang Na Me Shao Zen Yang Pei Fan. "
Seafood soup but only a few spoonful and is salty. Not enough soup
"Dont waste your money on this stall. Ordered LARGE and paid $13, came with less than HALF A BOWL of soup hahaha. Only order if you're the kind who sees half a glass of water as half filled instead of half empty lol"
my girlfriend absolutely love the seafood soup. one serving is always not enough
"I have visited Yan Ji way back when they were still located at the former Woodlands Town Center. Their soup was superb back then and I was willing to wait more than an hour for a slurp of the seafood goodness.

However, since they moved to Marsiling Mall, food quality has dropped gradually over the years. I am quite sure they have reduced and/or changed some of the key ingredients because the soup tasted more bland and the seafood did not taste as fresh as before.

What did not change is the comparable small amount of soup given and the relatively higher price tag as hawker food.

Is it still worth trying? I would say yes. Do I feel motivated to eat it regularly? Unlikely."
SOUP SIBEI GOOD BUT THEY SIBEI RUDE. Food's good tho.
Not great anymore. The guys running the place are more interested in just collecting money and not what your order is. Asked for boneless fish slices and still got served a jaw bone portion. The soup is watery thin and no longer that broth like and the portions are smaller (probably due to inflation).
Ordered the cheapest available item at $7.5. Small portion with chunky n but not much flavour minced pork. The 2 prawns are fine . Fish is also. The soup is simply prawny soup. Trying first time but dun think will be a repeat customer
"One of the best authentic seafood soup available in the North, but the quantity of soup is pathetic. Ordered a small and a large takeaway only to see this when I opened at home. Cost $20 but come on lah... such a big plastic container then the soup is like 15% of its volume. Apa ini."
Food is good but the guy is rude. Enough said
"No photo of it coz jus dive into it. Always do take away as wife feel the place is too hot with a baby.
Soup is really really damn good or rather suit my taste perfect.
But the take away box is very big yet the soup is just 1 quarter full. Repeated request for more soup but still like this. Always ordered the largest portion and was told more fish but soup same quantity. Jus take note. Stingy on soup."
"For the princely asking sum, quantity of soup  / broth is appallingly little, more precious than gold. Freshness of ingredients is nothing to rave about at this price, it should be a given"
"The quality and portion has dropped tremendously. Look at the portion size, especially the soup given for the $9.50 basic portion! Soup is also just salty now. Best to boycott such black shops who constantly raise prices, shrink portions and compromise on quality.

Confronted the stall owner about portion size and he mumbled some nonsense about his soup being about ""taste"" which is total nonsense! He reluctantly gave a few more spoonfuls of soup - never ever again."
"Popular seafood food in the hawker Center. Expect long waiting time. Tried the cheapest option first before you upgrade to more expensive option with red  groupers, crawfish and abalone. Soup is nice. Must have Bian Yu inside. Cheaper option just come with dolly fish. Only soup and white rice no other carbo option."
Excellent soup.
"Soup is full of umami, simply robust. My must eat item, whenever i m here. U gotta try it too! "
"Best seafood soup in woodlands area!
Highly recommended to all!
Thumbs up!"
One of the best seafood soup!
Seafood tastes fresh and soup is very flavourful! One of my go-to stalls when I visit the hawker!
"Tried other seafood soup but i must say Yan Ji Seafood soup is the best.

Ordered the $9.50 seafood soup and it was filling enough for me. But if you're a big eater you should definitely go for the $11.50 one.

Would come back to try the crayfish and red grouper the next time."
"Soup was fishy and tasteless
Kailan was salty
Prawn roll overcooked"
"My go to place for cray fish seafood, never disappoints"
Fresh seafood flavourful soup! Portion is pretty good. Friendly uncle.
"Soup is nice and seafood is fresh.
Might wait awhile for food preparation."
Power seafood soup
Nice ingredients with nice soup base 
Recommended. Nice and tasty. My kids love the soup.
Rich soup and fresh seafood!
"A honest and personal review on this.

Ordered Clayfish Seafood Soup, $13.50, because of the price (I think), the portion is generous, it got clayfish, minced meats, dory fish, prawn and some sliced tomatoes.

Maybe because of the minced meats given, a huge portion, almost filled whole the bowl, there is not much of the ""seafood"" taste in the soup. The food tastes more than mixed pork soup, Zhu Za Tang. The sweetness came from the pork instead of seafood.

If you are looking for a food portion that worth for the price, this is the right place."
not sure why people say the soup is very flavouful and sweet. was quite disappointed and it was very bland and no seafood flavour; the portion of soup given was pretty sad too... $8 for watered down soup? no thanks. would not return. my house downstairs fishball noodle soup also more flavour 
"Paying $9.50 for a pathetic medium size if seafood soup, charging me additional 50 cents for a takesway bowl that pack almost nothing in that bowl! Feedback on the spot but worker say that more soup will ruin the taste, what a ""splendid"" excuse. Not patronising it ever again!"
Yummy! Refreshing broth and ingredients are all really fresh! The uncle was really friendly too! :)
"Used to be my favorite seafood soup for over 10 years but the standard has dropped significantly. The last few times I had, soup is just salt water and prawns are tasteless. Even the chilli/soy sauce doesn't taste nice and felt like it is gonna spoil. They're trying to expand too much that quality is so bad now. I will continue to try occasionally hopefully can get back to previous standard and the seafood soup that I like."
OMG.... Cannot believe it... The lengendary sea food soup has become in tbe Age of Great Shrinkification....
This FOR SURE is my ALL TIME favourite  shop ! Been patronising for the past 10yrs !! . Original shop in marsiling mall food court ! I will have his food as long as I'm alive 
"Esp at $8 but I don't find the soup having any seafood flavours. Granted they giv lots of meatballs but I don't find it nice. Noodle portion is small.

Chilli also taste run of mill.

Not worth it"
"The best seafood soup I have ever had. Very nice broth, flavourful. Definitely worth the money, should come and try."
"ingredients were all of high quality and servings were generous (soup aside).

grouper was fresh and bouncy, and honestly the prawns were the sweetest ive tasted in a soup dish. the cook of everything was perfect as well.

overall worth the price paid. will be back for more!"
Very delicious seafood soup in this area and super friendly stall owner. Definitely worth trying.
Very delicious!!
"It's quite true that the serving of soup is rather lacklustre but the ingredients are top-grade. Fresh flakey fish, sweet tender prawns and flavourful pieces of meat. More meat pieces than seafood to the point that I was wondering if I ordered some pork soup. Still a good store to patronise if you're at this hawker. Quite steep pricing though - I paid $7.50 for my soup and that was the cheapest option."
"Affordable and nice.
Value for money i will go back there to eat again"
always so long queue. so many people like it. cannot be wrong.
Best seafood soup which they have maintain on all sweet savory soupbase & fresh seafood especially their fish at all their outlets. Never once disappointed. Thumbs up.
"I've patronized this shop for the past 4 years and I have seen how the quality has evolved from wonderful to average. The soup used to be thick and rich which is what I love about it and at this moment, unfortunately I would say it is watery and diluted. The consistency for the quality of the soup differs from time to time and you will never know what you'll get."
"The soup is indeed flavourful but it's ridiculous the amount of soup this stall gives. It's only half bowl of soup!
For $8, all you get is 2 prawns, minced pork (how is this seafood?), and few slices of DORY fish, it's not even batang fish!
It's overpriced for the quality of ingredient they use. Lousy! "
"At first I was shocked by the quantity of the soup but after tasting it, the soup is really flavorful. Some places would just top up with water but here, they give you the concentrated soup... No complain la.. The pork mixed with salted fish, is the highlight for me. Very delicious... I think is one of the memorable and tasty ones I have tried. Price a bit expensive....mine cost $14 with rice. Surely 3-4 big prawns, red groupa fish and excellent minced pork deserve better recognition. I know if I cook this, will cost much more and deplete much of my time and energy!"
Standard dropped quite alot. Last visit.
"Standards have somewhat dropped,may try again another day"
Super soup but slightly too salty. Great umami
"Nice and fragrant seafood soup, power la!"
"Seafood soup cost $7.50 and rice cost $8. Waited for around 12min, it was deceptive that it doesn't have queue with their buzzer when they have quite a number of order b4 my turn.

Honestly the soup was damn nice... While it lasted. It became even nicer after u peel the prawn head off and let the prawn paste molecules diffuse from region of higher concentration in the prawn head to region of lower concentration in the soup. Heightening the umami goodness.

But omg the amount they give was really pathetic. The owner is nice and friendly... If you are reading this review please let me know if there is free refill. I will gladly up the stars. The fish was also great but the prawn wasn't very cooperative in separating itself from its shell. Not a nice experience.

Mince pork was very out of place in a seafood soup and a bit greasy. Salvaged by the chili. So in summary too little soup like really very little. Prawn wasn't the best. Pork has poor synergy... Just replace with other aquatic meat?"
"Order Seafood SOUP, but the amount of soup is really a joke. Its more like seafood sides with gravy for your rice. Although its flavourful and not bad tasting, its definitely not worth your value for money ($7.5)"
Soup is of quality. Prices on the high side. Stall owner substituted fish slices instead red snapper
0 stars honestly. Bruh the portion is a joke. 7.50$ For a tiny bowl of soup without rice. If the soup was good i still can close one eye but bro it tastes like they just squeezed the zhap out from the prawn head. The prawn and meat was also so mushy and gross. So not worth. BOOOOOOO
The order arrived on time and was still warm. Very generous portions of pork and prawns. Seafood and fish was fresh. A bit expensive for the portion. Delicious soup !
it was super good! the broth is really full of flavour. the meat is well marinated. prawn is fresh.
"Unfortunately I have to give this a 2 star.
It used to be a 5 star flavourful soup everything was nice Chili was perfect.
Now soup just taste like plain water never had a soup that bad ever."
"The restuarent name is Yan ji seafood SOUP! But only this a little amount of soup, this is the worse outlet I nv seen"
"Soup is pathetic and it's not hot at all... ask for a slight refill, they say refill soup will not have any taste... joke"
awesome and richbsoup base. fresh ingredients. price is $1-2  more than neighbouring competitors.
"The soup is only served in half a bowl, barely covering the ingredients. I asked for more soup, they told me ""the soup no taste one"". What's the logic? I ordered soup but the amount of soup is like gravy.

Furthermore, the soup is overly salty"
I have started eating it when the price was just 50% of now which was $3.80. Standard drop  drastically! But at least ingredients are fresh like the prawns but Today the prawn were extremely salty on its own after de shelf. Then I get to know these batch of prawns were soaked in salt water as they were not fresh.Soup is getting diluted with no aroma.

"Been having this soup for some time. You can choose from a selection of fish- dory, batang and red snapper (price differs). You can also add on other ingredients of your choice. Seafood is fresh and soup is flavourful, but they could have been more generous with the portion of the soup. Conditions include soy sauce with red chilli and a chill blend. The latter was a little too sour at times (too much vinegar). Overall, a nice place if you crave a bowl of comforting soup."
"New stall at Bedok. Tried the batang seafood soup which cost $12.
1. First soup was not hot. Just lukewarm
2. Soup taste was sour due to tomatoes
3. Fish was over cooked. A bit hard.
4. Minced meat tasted bitter. Not sure why.
5. Saving grace is the prawns which were very fresh.
Never going back again"
"Soup is so overly salty that we're so thirsty after few sips. Prawns were unfresh, shells were sticking to the meat. Will not patronise even if nearby"
"It used to be good many years back, but food taste and quality seemed to have deteriorated. The amount of soup is enough to make me NOT go back and eat this again, ever."
"Whenever I feel like eating seafood soup with rice, this is the place I go to."
Would recommend to anyone looking for good seafood soup! Good portion.
"Not enough soup, makes the entire soup very salty. The minced meat has bones inside."
"came to get a bowl of red grouper soup paid $16 (inc added fish maw) but all i got was just a bowl of disappointed... the soup portion was very little, minced meat was way more than the fish. soup was also more salty to my liking had the same order elsewhere and the fishes were generally better and didn't have bones as compared to this. i literally gave up after eating a few mouthfuls. maybe it's just me that doesn't understand the hype."
"This is a store which have been around for as long as I know.
They were originally from the demolished old woodlands center (My parents and I used to go there on a weekly basis).

Seafood soup has never been something I will eat as I find it a bit too plain, until I ate the seafood soup from this store.

The normal seafood soup and the pig trotters are recommended to try."
"Soup and food are good, but prepare to pay a little more"
"Their soup is supposed to be little, it's thick and concentrated, it's their ""signature"" since eons ago (was at Woodlands Central). I love their home made meatball and fresh prawns."
Very cheap for Fried Fish head beehoon soup at S$5.50C/(20.08.2022)
"The soup is so nice! I hope they could give me another portion of it!
Fish and prawn are fresh too."
"Food is delicious and if you're looking for good value for money stuff. Most importantly, service being rendered is excellent. Especially the chef by the name of william. Always cheerful and make guest laugh. Got to give it a try. Cheers !"
"Very nice and cozy place, soup is good, has lots of ingredients. Will come back again "
Tasty soup with fresh fish and handmade pork balls but pricy and lacking value.
"Best service, best food, best vibes. People are friendly, soup is crazy, i love Yanji"
"very good soup, definitely recommended"
"Very nice seafood soup in Woodlands, Singapore.You won't feel thirsty after eating, should be no MSG added."
Good soup Good atmosphere overall liking the place
"Although the soup is flavourful, the ratio of ingredients used is quite disappointing. The amount of gigantic meatballs vs the actual 'seafood' in the soup... should have been a meatball stall instead."
"Decent Fish Soup , among all the different outlets this is the one I like most. Slight wait even though it was off peak hour"
"It's really good experience to eat here for this yummy seafood soup! We ordered different soup with different fish,the soup is so delicous! I want to go back again! Meantime we also dabao fish soup so I can cook anything I want as base!"
"Very delicious , 10/10 will recommend"
"A bit expensive for a small bowl and the meat taste weird. Soup however, taste nice"
Standard drop. Soup very diluted
Good quality seafood soap
"Since I am around this area, drop by to Yan Ji Seafood for a comforting bowl of Crayfish Seafood Soup ($13.50). Crayfish, dory fish, prawn, and huge meat balls in Umami rich broth, worth the trip.

Location: Yan Ji Seafood Soup, Marsiling Mall Hawker Centre, 4 Woodlands Street 12, Singapore 738620"
The seafood soup is really nice and delicious. The price is slightly on the high side though. 
Shi Wu Duo Yang Hua
"They can't even get a simple thing like a proper delivery order right, on multiple occasions too."
"Taste : not really fantastic
Price : normal

Soup too little, too much milk taste, doesn't have any seafood taste
Meat too hard

Overall experience: "
been my childhood favorite until now 
"Best seafood soup . Eating since I was a child .
Price keep increasing tho ."
Very nice seafood soup
Paid $24.90 for the seafood soup + scallops but did not receive the correct order. Not sure how to chase back my money.
"Taste of nostalgia, soup is rich and tasty, almost like gravy."
quality of prawns and meat was fresh. however the portion of soup is pathetic for a $7 bowl.
"Have Google famous food for woodlands and this come on top. Thought that it's good and come for a try. Totally disappointed with the food and service. Fish soup with little soup only 1/3 of the bowl served. When ask to have more soup the stalker owner said this is what it is.
To be frank I've had better tastier fish soup such as First Street Teochew fish soup who give generous portion of soup and fresher iingredient with more reasonable price.  Will not try again as the price not worth."
Bought the most expensive bowl with crayfish... End up with 1/3 bowl of soup.... V not hawker friendly :/
Delicious and tasty seafood soup. Worth to try!
"Wei Dao Hen Nong Yu Jiu Shi Shao Liao Xie..
Hen Bu Cuo Hen Hao Chi Xian Bu Fang Shi Shi"
"Though the amount of soup is pathetic, it's incredibly flavorful. The meatballs and prawns are tasty, and the fish is just average."
"The best seafood soup in Singapore, the original Yan Ji! So I thought...
Soup was umami and decently delicious... but I remembered it to be stronger, richer and thicker! Too much soup in my bowl... I used to get less than that back in old Woodlands Centre FC time.
Bak chor still infused with ti po, just not as rich as I remembered it to be.
Rice still very good, high quality Thai Hom Mali.
Overall still a very good bowl of seafood soup, definitely one of the best."
"The soup is thick, the meat portion is generous."
"Soup very very salty, seafood is not fresh. Not worth the price at all"
"$9 for the larger basic seafood soup, mushy disintegrating prawns, low quality white fish, pork wasn't too bad in seasoning but was too dry, needed more fat in the mince. Soup was ok, was a clear prawn stock base but a thick layer of yellow oil on top. Wouldn't even bother to try the 'premium' 20$+ stuff."
"A drop in food quality after change of chef, now the soup very oily and salty"
"Terrible service. Waited 40mins standing there. Then the stall owner still come tell me the beeper no battery, he been pressing and I shld have went to ask. Can't he have just shouted the number and check if someone did not come forward. Terrible. If want to get this yanji, go patronise the stall at Marsiling Lane instead. Much better service, cheaper charges too."
"Went near lunch hours so lots of delivery orders, waited 30mins as store forgotten my order but served others..... Soup is more salty than umami. While ingredients are quite fresh and plenty, but at $11.50 for soup + rice the price not worth the experience and calories, so I won't be going back again. I won't try this if not the fish soup store alongside is close like forever and there's was a ok review on this store....cannot trust the food reviewer...."
"Very nice, at least $7."
"The shop is named seafood SOUP but the amount of soup in the bowl was pathetic. When i requested for more soup i was told ""the ingredient is the soup that u're paying for (???)"" Soup tastes good but definitely not worth $7"
"Take away order. Soup only half bowl. 2 prawns, more minced meat than fish, 50c container. Ok but not fantastic. Will not travel to eat an expensive minced meat soup."
"Wo Jing Guo Er Yi,Mei You Chang Shi 
Gai Ci Cai Qu Chang Shi "
The wait can be abit long
"1. I've tried this so many times but it's now salty AF. The one at far east plaza tastes better now
2. Boss does not seem to work here anymore
3. The lady who takes the orders had the most couldn't-be-bothered attitude I've ever seen"
"Take away a seafood soup with rice. Asked for no prawns and more soup. Seller totally ignored my request.
Soup was not even half bowl.
More meat than fish.
Soup was super salty.
This is my 3rd try. Thinking that the previous 2 try was just a one off lousy soup.
Now I can confirmed it is lousy."
My favourite seafood soup
"The broth is quite good, however, the pork smell is a bit too overwhelming. The crayfish meat is too little therefore not worth the price."
All hype. Thirsty after the meal. Not worth the price n wait.
Very very tasty seafood soup with not much actual soup. Lol. But can eat la.
"Tabao the crayfish seafood soup for dinner,  average fish soup, a little pricey."
"Bad service attitude. Give customer the ""Yao Chi Jiu Deng"" attitude. Was waiting at the counter waiting to give my order by was treated like transparent for good 5 mins."
Been a little while since we visited this stall.  Somehow not as nice as before but still a good seafood soup
"The ingredients are fresh and plentiful, but if the soup can be more will be perfect."
Seafood is very fresh! Tasty broth.
Not bad but rather expensive and they make the soup rather a few mouthful. Minced meat is nice but can't say for the fish ( dory or Spanish mackerel ) seems to be too tough for my liking. There are 2 spinoff nearby one at blk 19 and the hawker center. Overall all 3 increase their prices once they are popular.
"Travelled across the country for this. Did it once, might do it again! Don't go all the way there for the cheapest thing on the menu... go big or go home!"
"Do you want to guess how much is this morsel of broth? $7.50, and you're not given premium ingredients which was really the point of buying from them. 50 cents was charged for this tiny container (not stated on the stall anywhere). there are only 2 prawns (it's not the good type of prawn - but the cheapest type that costs $16 per kg). The fish given is sutchi (the cheapest fish also). The broth was very salty.

The staff was inattentive, walking in and out to play with children and didn't bother to cook. Someone spilled some soup on the counter the staff didn't bother to clean up.

The best part is this picture that says the yan ji promise: explaining why it takes 5 mins. It doesn't take 5 mins. We waited for 20 bloody mins during the off peak hour.

The boss is no longer around and the staff are ruining the shop. I don't think it's worth the price or wait."
"Tried this highly recommended seafood soup during lunch and found it to be worth it, very well worth in (IMO)...
The fish meat practically 'melts' after you place into your mouth...
The stall owner is very generous with the 'large sized' pork miced meat which is delicious as well...

Soup is fanstatics but quality given is rather little...

Overall is a good recommended place to visit if you have craving for seafood soup and rice."
"7 or 9 dollars is quite ex, but amount of ingredients, which results in less amount of soup. Soup is hearty, fish is fresh."
"Hearty seafood pork soup
Fresh prawns, fish n the meatballs are very well flavoured
Can taste the dried fish among other things in the soup
Another thing was I didn't need to eat any rice with this soup... Is not very filling but there's so much goodness in it that I didn't feel hungry until dinner
Amazing"
"Loving their #FishSoup / #SeafoodSoup, with #DoryFish, #MicedMeatBalls and prawns. It's been about 2 decades since i first tried this at their first stall in the hawker centre at Woodlands (area demolished now). Now they have a few branches around Singapore.
.
They had however only managed to maintain 80% of the good taste in my opinion, but it is still recommended nonetheless."
Large soup is small. Mediocre taste. Would not recommend for the price.
"The worker of woodlands marsiling mall branch had a very terrible attitude, the boss also comment that she should not shout to customer, go to other branches if you want to eat their soup."
"Since the early days when this store was located at 4A Woodlands. It has been my go to store for prawn soup. The soup based are just right for my taste buds, not salty but filled with flavor from the prawns, the crayfish and the meat. The portion of the ingredients are a good amount but I just wished they could give more soup. While they have more options to choose from, the price are still affordable (In my opinion). A basic set is enough to fill you up but it will keep you coming back for more. Overall, I would say, I will come back again and again and again. It's worth the money for a delicious soup."
It's so so for me.
Great Tasty Food
Soup is kind of salty and msg have alot
Will never go back to this store unless you want to take the risk of getting covid. The lady boss never bother to wear mask while packing the take away. Very Low hygiene awareness
Good taste
"I have tried all the various similar seafood soup, one in Marsiling lane hawker, one in Marsiling lane Coffeeshop (where the famous Bak ku teh resides), one in woodlands industrial park, one in Bedok north.

Overall, this is the worst I ever had. Not only it's more costly than the rest. The red grouper fish soup is not entirely fish slices... it comes with fish head parts unlike other areas stalls that gives only fish slices. Have you heard about fish soup or seafood soup that gives you fish head parts... this is not fish head steamboat.. ok!!!

Will not patronise again."
Very rich sea food soup
Great value and taste! A cleaner environment too. Only wish is the place has better ventilation. Not sure why it's so stuffy although it's a new place with fairly high ceiling.
"Soup portion was really little as compared to its pricing. What really ticked me off was that they do not provide serving trays. Collection is self-service but they do not provide the trays for you to carry your hot soup back to your seat. I was searching for it and their staff told me 'you want tray need to pay 50c'. What nonsense is this? I bought only one bowl of soup but that doesn't mean I don't need a tray? I've got to carry my rice, utensils and chilli sauce. 50 cents just to get a tray LOL what a joke. Will not return for sure. (btw soup was okay but their crayfish tasted really fishy)"
"The best,!"
"Hao Chi,Wei Dao Bu Cuo. Jie Qian Zhong Deng"
down to have my usual seafood soup at yan ji... decided to opt for the fresh batang @$2 addtional instead of the usual dory and soup turns out to be better...next time will stick to batang version.... oh and not to mentioned the prawns and the bak chor is tasty as usual...wahaha
My colleagues most love lunch.
"Soups is good but too little, bold taste but more towards pork and salted fish rather than seafood. Portion is very little and no soup refill."
You order at the stall and they call you when your order is ready. Wait was about 20mins even though the coffee shop wasn't that crowded. Soup is tasty and the meatballs had dried cuttlefish which tasted good. Portion of soup was also more generous than their other branch at Marsiling mall.
Over-rated. Food was good but not fantastic. The bowl of soup with ingredients was less than half full! Over-price too. The braised pork leg was nice though.. their address at marsiling mall hawker centre is #01-26. I had to walk around the whole hawker centre to find their stall.
"The seafood soup is filled with really fresh ingredient. The soup is really sweet and tasty. The meatball is really juicy and it's meat tender.

Makes for a hearty and balanced meal with rice."
"Very tasty, a bit salty but good with rice.
The China woman at the cashier a bit rude."
Used to be good when they were at the old woodland center.  Standard and quality had dropped.
"I ordered a $9 dollar bowl of seafood soup with rice. Fish meat is dory fish, option to add $2 to upgrade to makerel fish. Comes with 4 fresh prawns, no complains about that. Mincemeat pieces have small fish bones inside, not advisable for small kids.

Overall, not value for money especially for dory fish."
Not nice as compare to others
"Bad Attitude owners, not coming even if the soup is 'tasty' you will know what's msg thirst after drinking the pathetic millilitre of soup given."
"Shi Chao Ji Hen Hao Chi,Bu Guo Qi Guai Na Pan Yao Gei Qian,Pan Bu Shi Bu Yong Qian De Ma,Tang You Hen Shao Bu Gou He,Hao Chi Jiu Hao Chi Dan Shi Chi Liao Bu Shi Hen Bao Ge,Suo Yi Wo Cai Gei Si Xing Er Yi,Ben Lai Xiang Gei Wu Xing De Jiu Shi Na Pan Yao Gei Qian "
Tasty seafood soup.  Only thing is the waiting time!
"Overpriced. The soup tasted more of pork than seafood. Nothing special, I wouldn't pay $12 for a bowl of seafood soup. Else where selling seafood soup of similar taste is only half the price. They seem to have increased price just because of the publicity."
The broth with fresh seafood is superb. A must-go place when I'm in Woodland.
Ordered the largest portion and bowl comes with half the amount of soup. Extremely poor service attitude who believes that patrons should put up with their bad attitude.
The soup is good but the service attitude stinks. They act as if everyone who wants to drink their soup should put up with their bad customer service. Wouldn't go back again if their food wasn't really good.
The best chinese seafood soup in the north
"Good soup with so many ingredients. I ordered basic version with SGD6.5. There are 2 shrimps, minced meat, fish and tomato. The broth is thick and delicious. I think it is very valued for the money. If u r near, I think it is quite worth it to visit"
Delicious seafood and soup
Nice soup base! But portion is too small
"F.... ING standard is not up to expectations of late, compare to years ago. I had been a customer of this stall since 1986. More than 30 years the current owner`s father was selling. Currently the cut chilli are soked in the soya sauce which make very salty. salty"
Food was nice but the price is slightly on the high side
Noticeably worse than the other outlet at KPT Coffeeshop at Marsiling. Also more expensive by a dollar. Staff made a mistake with 4 out of 6 of our orders and expected us to accept the mistake. I insisted that one order be remade and was made to wait 20 minutes. What kind of poor attitude is that? And the food centre was full of flies.
"The broth here is very flavorful, although it can be a abit salty if not taken with rice. Fish and ingredients were pretty fresh as well. Would recommend the red grouper seafood soup!"
Love the Pratas and Malay food here.
Good place for seafood
You won't find a better seafood soup in Singapore. It costs alot but the ingredients are also top top grade!
Good place for sea food lovers
The soup is very good. Have not eaten another better seagood soup.
"Yan Ji Seafood Soup is the original seafood soup which was at the defunct hawker centre near to the Singapore Train checkpoint. They had moved to Marsiling Mall. It has a sister outlet at Blk 19 Marsiling Lane under the name Yan Kee. There are two coffee shops at Blk 19 at both ends of the long block. Sin Kee is in the coffee shop where the popular Hong Ji bak kut teh is. Sin Kee's seafood soup is a far cry from Yan Kee's. This Sin Kee stall was started by an ex-employee of Yan Ji. This ex-employee opened and manages another stall in the nearby market hawker centre with the name SK seafood soup, he is the one often seen cooking your food.
Yan Ji seafood soup is the originator of this seafood soup. Try it yourself to see the difference, don't take my word for it. Personally, I prefer Yan Kee over Yan Ji even though they are sister outlets. Yan Kee somehow has an edge in taste over Yan Ji.
It is the best seafood soup version and I love it."
"Go for the premium and if you're going for the cheaper options, I can guarantee that it'll taste cheap as well. If not, this is a pretty solid seafood soup for a coffee shop standard."
"long waiting time > 30 mins, poor customer service, very small portion for 6.50, overly salty soup.. not recommended,"
Tasty soup that overcrowded with the Liao. Not bad.
Too expensive and the staff is rude... doesn't worth going..

"Poor service. Was upsold with ""premium"" ingredients which came up as a small bowl of soup. Queue and wait took around 20 minutes. It used to be good when it was at Woodlands Centre. Granted the soup is pretty tasty but I wouldn't support a business that is plain dishonest. Do yourself a favour and patronise other stalls around for cheaper and more filling food."
Wide selection of food
"It been sometime since I last eat Yan Ji seafood soup. Surprise no long queue. Soup broth no longer thick, no mushroom in soup. PRAWN still good, fish acceptable. Meat Ball so so. Overall slightly disappointed. Maybe the chef is not the same as last time."
Best seafood soup in Singapore after the one at Woodlands Checkpoint closed down
The one oder later than me get the food first just because he order more expensive item!
"Website states open but at 11am still close. Check with stall attendant, who was annoyed and told off.
Guess they are getting arrogance. Therefore, do judge for yourself.
Btw, I had been earing this stall since Woodlands Central days or at least 10 years.
Very disappointed."
"I give 1 star because of food taste not so bad... but the stall ppls all very rude, no manner. Asking for extra chilli sauce, they reply, take yourself... i okay with it never mind... i take myself, i take extra 2 only... the stall ppl tell me, don take so much. Omg... i will never go buy again..."
"Standard of food drop so much, and didnt seems to care about customer orders."
The seafood soup by this chain of hawkers have been one of my favorite all time food. However the standard of the soup has dropped in comparison with their very first stall at woodlands old town hawker centre(beside woodlands checkpoint) a pity it has been demolished. Now none of its joints upholds the same standard for the soup. Now its just a fish soup that cant justify its price.
"Soup had a burnt aftertaste and the amount of soup is pathetic. 5 spoons  later and there will be no more soup.

The stall will not give you more soup, they say it'[s their style.

It's very expensive for the portion given and also the very long waiting time. Up to an hour during dinner time.

There are better and much cheaper food there."
Very nice seafood soup
Delicious Seafood soup.
"$8.50 for patin fish (fresh water cheap fish). Just doesn't make sense. More minced pork than seafood. Mince pork soup or seafood soup?

The braised pork is dry.

Quality of the soup is not bad. You can taste the dried flatfish."
Very delicious seafood soup
"Expansive and overrated,no second time !"
Very very nice soup... Very addictive
"Fabulous seafood soup, terrible service .. will still return .."
Soup too less
"My brother-in-law suggested having lunch here, and it was pretty good.

We opted for the $12 bowl, with an additional $2 of clams.  The soup broth was quite tasty, and there were nice fresh and plump prawns, as well as a crayfish, with some clams.  All the seafood was fresh, and we especially loved the meatballs, which has a taste of squid/umami."
Clean n good
Huan Shi Bao Chi Yi Guan De Shui Zhun. 
Variety to choosa and car park convenient
Food is nice but pricey. Location is far out for most people.
Love the soup because it's like a broth and the shop owners are generous with the ingredients.
"Fair good,"
"Too expensive, little bit only"
"Broth was very very good,seafood was very fresh and price was reasonable."
"Yan ji seafood soup very good,"
Really unique and rich soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it

"The seafood soup is really good. Very different from any seafood soup I had. Definitely worth a try. The ingredients include 2 prawns, chunks of fish, minced meat and clams. However, it cost $6.50 for a really tiny bowl of soup, that's not even half full. Found it really expensive. The wait is also horrendously long, up to 20 minutes for a small bowl. I ordered first and got mine in 10minutes. A friend who ordered right after me got his only 10 minutes after mine was served."
stuffy place
delicious food.
"This stall serve tasty seafood soup. The soup is very thick and the ingredients are of high quality. As such the price of the seafood soup there is costly. We order a bowl of Cray fish seafood soup and it set us back by SGD $14. The portion is good for one person, so if you are thinking of sharing this than it will surely be not enough. Will I come back again? I will not purposely make my way there."
Not the freshest of ingredients but the soup sure packs a punch.. taste a little like fish head steamboat. Won't mind coming back of in vicinity.

Soup is good. Price reasonable. How cheap people expect for seafood in singapore? May not be the best but definitely worth trying.
"The seafood broth is very tasty and love the ample portion of minced meat given. Only setback is the soup is cooked individually and not given a lot. If you need more soup, only the plain soup will be given. But the good thing is ... getting more soup is free and I guess I can't expect much. Carpark is available in the building so it's convenient if you drive."
Prawn is fresh. 1piece of lala. 2prawns.Soup damn little. Seafood soup yet many minced pork can try once after that your gone. Overrated
Used to be so much better. But it's a different seafood soup compare to those sold by the fish soup stall.
"Soup is very flavourful. But they give very little. The cheapest seafood soup starts at $6.50. Add $0.50 for rice. Would say it's still ok given the portion. You get a few pieces of thick fish, 2 fresh prawns & some minced meat. Dun be mistaken if there is no queue. They have a buzzer system."
Its pork and fish having a clubbing experience in your mouth
"Not bad, though I like like the original one from Woodlands. The price has also went up."
Not all seafood soup are the best but they can do better.
Overpriced & over rated! Not worth!
Original. So far the best one..
"Ordered the $12 seafood soup with scallop and fish maw. The soup is rich in flavor though I think the quantity of soup could be more. Other than the scallop and fish maw, there were 3 prawns, at least 4 pieces of homemade meatballs, clams and fish meat."
Unique seafood soup! Hard to find this flavour elsewhere. However there are some times when the taste is more flavourful (evening time).
First class seafood soup once again
"Although still flavourful, I also find the standard has dropped.  The soup is no longer as ""thick"" as before.   The prices keep going up and portion keeps diminishing, so much so that the soup given now is pathetic.   The uncle at stall got some attitude.  I think they are getting too complacent."
Fresh seafood soup! Nice place
"The soup was great!! The dish had a good measure of dory fish which was soft and tender, minced meat which was firm, fresh and juicy prawns as well as the crayfish!"
"Very very bad. It used to be very nice. But for the last 3 times I tried at night, tasteless. and notice the Chef has changed as well. Very very very disappointed!"
"Fresh seafood in an awesome stock! Take your pick of seafood with Dory, batang or crayfish."
"Great seafood soup with fresh prawns, fish and shell fish. Super tasty soup as well."
"Always love the seafood soup here. Broth has the savory scallop taste, prawns juicy, thick fish slices and generous servings of meatballs."
Really tasty soup!
The soup is so amazing!  The seafood is cooked perfectly too.
"Still the best seafood soup ever in SG

however, prices are slowly creeping up while portion are gradually getting lesser

no topping up of soup is a real bummer.....

the $10 set meal that includes braised tofu,egg n pork knuckles are not worth it.

would rather go for the bigger bowl of seafood soup instead"
Liked the lor mee. Affordable too.
"New operating days w.e.f May 2025
Fridays - Tuesdays, 7.30am - 3pm"
"Decent bowl of laksa but queue moved very slowly, partly because most customers ordered at least 2 bowls. Waited 20 mins for my bowl of laksa.

Minus one star for the tiny sea hum which became rubbery after mixed into the gravy, and one smelled bad."
"Jan 25 18, we have Laksa @ a big one at 5.50. Very good favour, one of the best laksa in north of SG. They also has lot Mee and prawn noodle. To try again in future."
"had laksa, lor mee n prawn mee here. like the taste.
good price.

friendly boss and staff.
help nicely bag the soup n noodles separately with a smile.

expect long queue at lunch hour n possibly run out of some choices early on busy days. so go early."
"Best laksa I had in 2024! Rich, creamy & just the right amount of umami, making a superb bowl of laksa! Not forgetting the si-hum! Must try!
Lor Mee quite decent too, though personally I prefer their laksa."
"Certainly one of the most delicious chicken chop Lor Mee I have tasted at any hawker center I have tried across Singapore! The portion was generous, the added spices and vinegar were a delectable sensation for the tastebuds. The chicken was tender and lean and perfectly prepared. Ye Lai Xiang Chicken chop Lor Mee is a 'MUST TRY' when around the Marsiling Mall."
"The food here is above average. Located at the rear end of this hawker centre which is quite remote. Location is also quite warm as air circulation is limited.
Taste wise, Laksa is nice but not on the same level as the popular Yishun laksa.
Lor mee is also nice but they dun have fried fish version which I prefer."
Laksa is pretty unique but lor mee is just bad..
"Went early to avoid queues but reached is already long queue, tried with my wife their cutlet lor mee, prawn noodle dry and laksa all is nice   portions is big too worth the price. Prawn noodle dry sauce and chilli is nice soup was great too, laksa is thick and fragrant and lor mee right texture with nice and flavourful taste "
"Decent taste laksa, lor mee and prawn noodle. Can be improved.

Latest review: Prawn poop not cleaned. Can see the black material. Can't continue with the bowl of noodles."
"Food was great. As a big laksa fan, definitely enjoyed it a lot. The nasi lemak was great too, with fluffy rice. Place was clean and comfortable. Would def come back again."
"Nice environment, reasonably priced food. Can come again."
Tried the outlet at Sembawang. Yummy laksa cook in a traditional way. 
"Service so so, but the soup of laksa is quality, cockles is 2 dollars if added, more expensive than Yishun 928 and sungai road, of course 928 and sungai road taste better"
"I ordered a bowl of laksa. The broth looks thick and tasty. Somehow the taste wasn't as thick as it looks but however I still enjoyed the food. Had 2 prawns, half egg and couple of fish cake and I didn't want cockles. Overall it's good"
"Solid lor mee, been having it since young. Very generous with the ingredients!!"
Laksa was good and tasty ! Will definitely come back again
"Laksa is oily and tasteless. To make matters worse, Priority given to Grab orders and regulars, hence wasting queuing customers time."
"Haven't had Lor Mee for decades and their 4.50 Chicken cutlet Lor Mee was freaking delicious and filling. Thick and hot gravy, chewy noodles served with a dollop of garlic, vinegar and chilli that taste like a food haven every mouth. Store is located along the row furthest from the entrance of hawker centre."
First try at their pork rib prawn noodle served dry with soup on the side. Very tasty soup broth and the pork rib is very nice. Tried the $5 version. Staff very friendly and Marsiling mall is airy and not very crowded. Can recommend.
"Ordered Prawns Mee Pok (Dry), Lor Mee, and the Laksa. For the former two, a two stars will be in order (an average affair). Now, the laksa is easily a top for the northern sector of Singapore and an excellent contender for the war of Laksa, which has been going on for years. The laksa character is lighter in broth, although it looks rich with the hei bee base. There is a hint of natural sweetness and not heavily seasoned. The thick bee hoon didn't manage to soak up the broth enough to bring out the al dente taste. To appraise the super fresh blood cockles given is heavenly match to the laksa. At least it would not leave you the greasy feel. Overall, I may have eaten the tastiest one, but this would fill the gap of good taste at Woodlands area since I haven't found the good food in this area yet."
The curry and coconut thickness is not bad but taste average. Lacks alot on sambal shrimp taste...
"One of the best laksa in the north. Very fragrant and thick broth, paired well with the al dante thick bee hoon. Do come before 1pm in case it sells out and order the large size!"
"A better than average bowl of laksa , gravy was not boiling enough to bring out the aroma"
"Tried their laksa and prawn noodles. Prawn noodles forgettable, soup was on the sweet side. Laksa acceptable but overrated. Ingredients for the large $5 version was miserable, 2 prawns, some fishcake slices, half hard boil egg, few pcs of taupok and hum. Lots of noodles given though. EAT laksa taste better in my opinion."
Really fragrant laksa broth and chilli! It made for a satisfying meal without being too jelak.
Stall is inside marsiling mall hawker at level 1. So far tried the lor mee and laska. Both are good and hearty. Ingredients are generous compared to current market now. Regular dinner staple. Certain weekdays are very crowded.
Laksa soup is thick with shrimp flavour. Chilli is good too. Value for $
"Probably the best laksa in the whole of woodlands. Conveniently located at the sprawling hawker centre of Marsiling Mall, this stall is kind of hidden deep near the back entrance of the shopping mall and hawker centre. There will always be a queue at breakfast , lunch and dinner time so just be patient."
Good lor mee. Will try other food atvhis stall
"Great old stall bringing memories of the Old Woodlands Town food. Have been eating their prawn noodles and laksa from 1 kid to 3 kids to my eldest girl got married in Jun22 and yet without fail she will home asking for her favourite laksa and prawn mee.

Some old photos to share their last few days of operation in Nov 2017 before the whole place officially closed in 01Dec17."
"Tried the prawn noodles and lor mee, quite decent."
It's my first time here at Marsiling Mall. Had Lor Mee and it was good! Glad that I came slightly before Lunch time to avoid the crowd 
"This stall usually have long queue but they are almost sold out after 2pm on Sunday and I was lucky that laksa was still available. The takeaway was packed using tapao bags, hence no need to spent 20cents for the container. $4 noodle was quite generous and other ingredients too. The fish cake was bit hard but their laksa soup was creamy and flavorful. It also comes with cockles. Would definitely go back if wanted creamier soup based noodle and also to try their lor mee.
Updated Sept 2022
As expected, the last bowl of laksa (at 2:30pm Sunday) is just awesome. The creaminess gravy goes well with the noodle. Other ingredients is generous too."
Love their laksa. I always finished the gravy. Authentic.
"My kind of laksa, with the soup/gravy on the coconut-ier side of taste. People who like theirs with some spicy kick maybe wouldn't appreciate it as much. Bowl was packed full of ingredients. While decent, I didn't think it was exceptionally memorable."
My personal favourite! A good portion at affordable price. Will definitely go back again
Delicious bowl of laksa in Woodlands area about 10 mins walk from Marsiling MRT. $4.50 gives you a reasonably big bowl with lots of ingredients!!!
"I would say the laksa probably the best amongst all the other offerings like lor mee and lean noodle. I like the less richness of the laksa broth and saltiness just about right. Many has lots of coconut added made too rich. You can add cockles as many stalls can't do. The lor mee is too bland, lack of the taste of the flavour of the meat or seafood. Ingredients are quite generous for a $3.5 portion and more than enough for one person. The prawn mee is kind of too sweet and lack of umami taste especially.. prawn mee must taste like strong flavor of the prawn. I believe they don't use enough of the prawn head and shell to make the broth. Overall average in my opinion..."
Laska is nice and the thick bee hoon goes well with the gravy. Good coconut fragrance. The gravy is has a sweet tint. Small serving though.
"A hearty bowl of laksa. Slightly above average at best. A tad bit sweet. Can try if you're around the area but wouldn't queue more than 10 min. for it.

Three stars for the laksa alone but one extra star for the variety of food offerings, preparation work must be tough!"
"Lor Mee was pretty ok. strong taste with decent ingredients. Only thing i don't like is the gravy is too thick. They used so much starch or flour that the gravy was pretty jelly like.

Edit 2021.
Tried their prawn mee with pork ribs recently. The broth's taste is pretty decent. Ingredients wise the prawns are slightly not to my liking with regards to size and freshness."
"My wife and I were looking forward to trying their famous laksa. There was a queue but was cleared swiftly.

The laksa is above average but it was on the sweeter side and we are not very used to it.

Cheers to the young lady boss who decided to take up the challenge of being a hawker and to relieve her family's burden."
Laksa without laksa leaves with only 3 tiny cockles.  Laksa soup not thick too. Very disappointing... Will not recommend...
A little saltish but generally tasty.  Sure there are better laksa out there.
Brought two reach nearby by for family. Lousy taste. Too oily. Un healthy food. Yellow Mee sorggy. Feel like refund to seller
"Very thick laksa soup. For a non Singaporean opinion, it is very satisfying and smell so good. Only a little disadvantage for me is a little bit oily. So it's too sinful. However it's still a good laksa for me. I remember it's sgd 3.5 only. Value for the money."
The quality has dropped since the original seller was hawking at Bukit Panjang (opposite Ten Mile shopping centre) during the late 60s to 70s. The noodles are soggy due to over boil. The laksa soup is not so aromatic as before.
"Delicious, gravy is tick with strong coconut milk fragrant"
A very tasty and thick gravied laksa. One of the nicest laksa in the woodlands area. Opens till 8pm only tho
Thick coconut gravy. The fried chilli sambal taste like nasi lemak sambal.
Lost and found. Personally endorsed by PCK himself! Formerly from the now closed forever old Woodlands Centre food centre. Really like the laksa. Prefer it over Katong's. Nice balanced flavor without being overly rich. Lor meeting is above average too. Crowd fav other than the laksa is the pork rib intestine prawn noodles. Will definitely try that three next time.
"Finally found laksa at the North Area that my picky wife likes. The soup is thick and nice. And of course, let's support the young Singaporean boss running this stall."
Doesn't disappoint! Always good
"I really like their dishes~ My go-to is the chicken set. I love how their chicken is always crisp on the outside yet tender and juicy on the inside. Been there several times and no exceptions really! The rice is also yummy. I enjoy their coconut rice which has more flavour and it seems like the base might have some brown rice too. Served with some achar, half a boiled egg, chilli and gravy. I'll recommend to all to try!"
"Got recommended to give it a try and it didn't disappoint. Their fried chicken is the bomb - really succulent on the inside, and crispy on the outside. Their curry is pretty decent too, though I wish it could be a tad stronger. Enjoyed their acar side and the sambal too. Definitely worth a try!"
"One of the highest quality, juiciest fried chicken you will ever find in Woodlands."
Great taste. Within acceptable price range and the portion is good. The fried chicken is a must try for those who never had it before.
Highly recommended.
Amazing value for Money and Taste. Must Try!!!!!
Tasty fried chicken. Friendly store uncle! Aircon kopi tiam. Thumbs up!
"Delicious Nasi Lemak, especially the very crispy fried chicken. Sambal is a bit spicy for me though and for eggs, I prefer a ""Mata Lembu"" (sunny side up)."
"Highly recommended for their quick service and fragrant dishes!

Chicken was thicc and moist. The crispy skin on the outside was flavourful. Even the curry, chilli and mutton sauce were incredibly fragrant."
"Nice archa pickles.
Their fried chicken is a must have whenever I order."
"Budget friendly and delicious! Chicken was really fresh and the curry gravy is thick and flavourful , rice was steamed to perfection too!"
Have not been back for 2 years.. disappointed is the word
You get what you paid for lor
"This set the highest standard I tried for nasi kukus!  Try the signature fried chicken! For the portion, it's sure affordable!"
One of the best fried chicken with curry sauce in Woodland. Store owner was nice and friendly. Will come again for sure.
"My friend who lives in Woodlands recommended this eatery. It's pretty much off the beaten path, although there's one MRT station 500 meter away and a bus stop just in front of the food court it's in.

Ordered red rice nasi dagang (braised rice a la Kelantan State in Malaysia) with fried chicken, which came with a lot of serunding (crispy fried grated coconut) and veggie pickles. This one is very well priced at $6 in spite of the portion size and the crispy and warm fried chicken. The sambal was the type that is coarsely grind and cooked in oil, infusing the fragrance to it. Better to have the meal quickly after serving before the serunding gets wet by the gravy and moisture!"
"Food is good and delicious. However, i gotten food poisoning that very night, couldnt sleep and vomitted with diarrhea. Probably that day the mutton wasnt clean or managed well"
Service is good and prompt. But was disappointed when i see the rice is no longer steam in a small container but just scope out from a big bucket. Taste of the rice is just normal and no longer fluffy. Overall doesn't taste the same as before.
"This is nice, the fried chicken is tasty, crispy outside tender inside. Rice is fragrance, chilie is nice. Speed for serving is fast. It's only $5, to me it's worth it.."
"Good food, large portion only $5. Very friendly and nice staff, nothing to complain about. Thank you!"
always consistent with their food 
"The fried chicken is, crispy, Juicy, delicious and hugee! And all that for only $5! Absolutely worth it.."
Ordered fried curry chicken and was served partially raw chicken first time I give chance second time is not acceptable
"Edit 3 (Dec 2023): Rated 4. Prices have come down though islandwide inflation. Portion size also now ok. Good they improved and not got overgreedy. Rating now 4 instead of 2 last year.

Edit 2 (Nov 2022): Rated 2 from 4
It used to be great.  But cost cutting by shrinkflation has made portions so small it doesn't fill me up anymore. Stopped visiting because I don't want to pay $6.5 to 8 in a kopitiam to go home hungry. You can make money, but getting greedy making regular customers feel cheated will bring bad karma, and business will fail over time."
Used to be my favourite and I was shocked that the standard dropped so much. The fried chicken skin was so salty. The fried chicken was no long juicy. It was definitely frozen chicken now instead of fresh chicken in the past based on the colour of the bones. Not worth going back anymore.
Curry decent
"As long as i come around here ,I will come to eat ,really good ,fried chicken is soft ,if you nearby, come and have a try..."
Not bad but standard is dropping
Service is delightful and they remember you(r order and customisations) 
"$5 for nasi kukus with big fried chicken drumstick and ""acha""
Portion is big for 1.5pax.
Overall is ok, chicken is crispy with slight spices seasoned.
Just that the meat close to chicken bone has ""frozen blood smell"".
Still value to $ and worth to try"
i bought the 4.50 curry nasi kuku steam rice. the rice is very well made & portion is value for money! curry and the chilli are definitely the star of the dish. will come back again!
"Had takeaway, still hot when home (about 10min drive). Chicken is tender, super crispy and crunchy skin, superb. Rice quite soft and would prefer to have more curry sauce as personally enjoy mor sauce on rice. Would reccomend!"
"If you get the wrong order,the workers might scold you even though you said the correct order.This happened to my child."
"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE EVER!!!! Was there a few mins ago and i ordered the nasi dagang fried pomfret fish set. The guy was telling me that the brown rice sold out and white rice is the only one available. My mistake for not hearing clearly what he said and i said yeah i would like the brown rice. He got agitated and repeated his sentence in an annoying way. I also told him i want the curry pack separately but when i reach home, the curry was mix together with the rice. This is not the first time they make this mistake, previously they mixed up my order too. NEVER GOING THERE AGAIN, I MEAN LIKE CMON AH IM ALSO IN THE CUSTOMER SERVICE LINE AND IT CAN BE QUITE FRUSTRATING DEALING WITH CUSTOMERS BUT DONT HAVE TO BE RUDE WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
I had mutton curry combo... Woahhhh... no words to express. I wipe the whole plate. Such a nice and yummy food. Wish to try again and refer my frnds tooooo
"Food taste nice , rice very nice
But increase price alr"
Used to be good la... but now standard dropped. Chilli very little only. The chicken outside looks promising! Inside red red one ):
Not so friendly seems like they think im getting my food for free
"crispy chicken but inside there is still blood and the sambal is a little sour .. maybe the cook has changed but it's okay, one more thing how bad it is to serve customers ...
last month i came to eat here the service is very good..the cashier is very polite and always very grateful to the customers"
"Very bad service
I'm always coming to buy meal from yes nasi kukus ..
I'm asking for curry separately but the kaka put together.. end she look not happy can see the eye
I'm always buy from small girl
She very friendly with all customer
Service very good..always make customers happy
That why I'm always come her"
"Their ingredients quality dropped. Ordered the mutton Curry and chicken curry steam rice, the meats are stiff and hard . The rice was undercooked. It was not the same compared to pre-covid days."
Very bad ... 1) Steam rice was so soggy almost porridge like texture 2) Ordered chicken and they gave me fish.
This is the 2nd time I ordered and they send a wrong order. really lousy and not paying attention to the order! just see it for yourself and tell everyone what is wrong. i believe a small child can differentiate what is a fish and what is a chicken. bad service! does the picture shows its a fish pomfret????!!
"A big piece of crispy chicken with egg, achar and curry.
Not the most tasty meal, but value for money one.
The queue may be long, but they serve every fast."
"I had a takeaway. I am using portions and quality of food as a benchmark.
Portions: Rice filled less than half of my Corelle bowl. If you rely on the sustenance of carb to last during the day, you may want to add and pay for another scoop. Gravies in both of the fish curry and mutton dish were rather dry.
Quality: The namesake, nasi kukus which means steam rice, was cold and clumpy. It taste too ordinary and not the steamed and fragrant rice I had anticipated. The saving grace was the ikan tongkol(tuna). It's fresh and the steak was generous. The mutton on the other hand lacked colour and was dripping of oil rather than the spicy gravy. Finally they score just a little on the taste department."
Nasi kukus is rare in Sg and this is really delicious and appetising.
Good food!
Nice steam rice with crispy fried chicken 
Absolutely Best fried chicken! Shiok chili! Not forgetting the achar! 
"Juicy and soft fried chicken, the steam rice (nasi kukus) is very fragrant! Combine with the curry sauce, yummy!

Price: $5 per set, it is totally worth it!
Environment: Air-cond kopitiam and not crowded during my visit."
Very soft steamed rice soaked with fragrant curry. Fried chicken thigh is crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside.
Taste is there.  But the portion of rice is pathetic. I even asked for Fried pomfret. Was given Chicken instead. Very bad.
All time favourite for chicken lovers who love both hot and crispy chicken. Food Consistency is there. The mutton dish is also good!
"A surprisingly great little store located in the neighbourhood of Woodlands South.

I tried the $5 fried chicken set which, though at first sight seem very ordinary, was anything but.

Every serving of rice is individually steamed in its own metal tin, resulting in a soft, mushy texture, which I took awhile to appreciate. It's not, however, as disgusting as it might sound. It's actually not bad!

The star of the show was definitely the fried chicken, for which I have to say is difficult to find a competition to beat this in Singapore.

However, I found the curry served with the rice a bit lacking (and perhaps even stingy). I'm also not convinced that hard boiled eggs work well with what they were selling, but this is purely a matter of preference.

The rice definitely needs more curry. I'll be happy if the store sells vegetables to go with the meal as well, but I'll happily be back whenever I need some sinful, unhealthy, dinner pleasures."
"Will change the rating once the stall improves, the gravy given is getting lesser especially when u know steam rice doesn't absorb the gravy effectively, then the chilli given is also way lesser nowadays then what do i eat my rice with? Air ah? The lady boss not very generous, can u train your staff to give things properly and not rush?"
The plain steamed rice texture was perfect. I had the asam sotong and the taste was good. The sotong is not rubbery. It was paired with achar and sambal and half hard boiled egg. The meal has a good combination of ingredients complimenting each other. Cost $5. Will try their signature chicken next.
"Not sure what's the hype for this place. The chicken is indeed very crispy, however the meat isn't as marinated as well as other fried chicken i've eaten. The rice is also not great quality and slightly mushy. Overall small quantity for price paid."
"Utterly disappointed visiting this place after reading the some of the reviews. As a fellow food enthusiast, the food is not really worth all the hypes about this place.

The single most important part of yes nasi kukus is the rice. But it may hv failed in so many different level. Its not soft fluffy well separated grains of rice, instead its some mushy normal rice cooker rice of little portion of compressed rice.

The curry toppings is mehhh, no flavors at all but sugar. Other side dishes of achar and sambal belacan is very little given the price of 5sgd.

The only acceptable part is the crispy chicken but also not flavorful enough. Given some of the reviews of this place as such comparison with the real kelantanese food, this place doesn't stand a chance at all."
"Their meat very juicy, food is nice, 10/10 support!"
Good value for $5. Balacan chilli is good.
"Awesome nasi kukus. Tried both nasi dagang and the nasi kukus with special fried chicken. Chicken is tender and crispy on d outside. Sambal is on the spot.

Non-stop got customers getting the food, even on the odd hours. Would go again."
One of the best branch of Nasi Kukus. The fried chicken drumstick is freshly cooked and crispy. The meat is not dry but tender. Would strongly recommend!
"Love their signature fried chicken. Had their Nasi Dagang Trader Rice $5.50. Curry, Rice and Chicken were great. Located in a trendy coffee shop with aircon and outdoor seating."
"Very nice food... the signature fried chicken leg quarter was crispy yet tender, perfect pairing with their sambal chili, the acar was super tasty which was a bonus +. Q was chop chop efficient even though can see that the folks were handling a good amount of delivery orders."
"Food is really good, but expensive for coffee shop pricing"
"Value for money, and I would recommend the signature fried chicken - chicken is crispy and tender! Available for takeaway too (self collect or FP)! Great to know there's good food in the north "
"Ayam goreng sooooooooo delicious. Want to give the boss compliment, very friendly and polite.  Impeccable"
"Placed order via foodpanda. Took around 15 mins to deliver. 2 set of nasi kukus - fried chicken & fish curry. Portion is big. Chicken is crispy & tender. Taste so good like the one I had in Kelantan. Comes with pickles & half boiled egg. The only downside is , should have packed the gravy separately . When the food came, gravy was dripping. Highly recommended"
Good food great prices
"It's better than what I had in Kelantan!
Strongly recommend the mutton and the signature fried chicken.
The curry is very flavorful and bold, acar is very tasty and appetising. The sambal is not too spicy and yet great aroma to pair with the rice and the ingredients.
You will surprise how tasty it is."
THIS IS SO GOOOD!! Juicy fried chicken drumstick and spicy chili! Love it!
"Signature fried chicken nasi dagang $5.50. Chicken is crispy outside and juicy inside, nasi dagang is a good choice, the sides achar pickles and egg are just average. I normally throw it away. Should consider buying just the rice and fried chicken. I tried their fried fish $5 for a medium size fish, it's crisp and fresh."
My friend recommended me this stall. And is stated there islandwide delivery. In the end. Says couldn't deliver to Tampines or International Plaza. Then in the first place shouldn't have state that. Disappointed.
"I ordered delivery from this stall website, delivery slot is from 11-12pm, but the food only deliver on site at 1.15pm. Very disappointing services."
"One of our delivery favorites for its juicy crispy drumsticks. Thick and fried to succulent flavor, the chicken drumstick complements well with the steam rice. The spicy gravy lends a good punch to the tender meat. Always a repeat order and great to go for this meal during circuit breaker!"
Tried the mutton and is one of the best.
5 minutes walk from Marsiling mrt. $4.50 for a plate of their signature fried chicken
Food is good and price is reasonable.
"Their dish is fantastic i love the curry mutton and adding the fried chicken, The chicken is nice and tender so is the mutton. Their samba asam sotong is yummy too go try if you guys haven't."
Fried chicken is nice where is crispy outside and moist inside.
Food was nice. Staff r nice n attentive.
I didn't try the chicken but the curry fish. Fresh and tender!
Juicy and crispy chicken
Food there are good.
Value for delicious curry and ayam was big and juicy
Good delicious food. You won't regret this one.
"Food is excellent! Ate the lamb + rice at $6. In my opinion, super worth it!"
Food was very nice. Service was excellent and price reasonable.
Nice Malay food
Affordable price and worth buying. Very tasty and the fried chicken is very tender
"What more can I say? It is very reasonable price, it is delicious. The chicken is like heaven crispy mmmm so juicy too! The chilli on the side put some in the gravy rice as well you get an awesome flavour train running on your tastebuds tracks. Recommended and they are very friendly as well. Like they say ""belum cuba, belum tahu. Sekali Cuba,  setiap hari Mahu""  . Just a saying never try never know, once you try you'll come back for more.  And of course they have fried fish, curry chicken & mutton, sambal assam sotong."
Cheap and tasty
"Chili is Yes & Shiok! Really yummy nasi kukus with fried chicken, it's chicken is really tender, well fried with delicious, crunchy and fragrant skin. Worth the try if you're around north side or at woodlands. We also had the curry chicken which is surprising delicious and soft. It's Halal and value for money. On average $5 per set."
"Overhyped. Curry is average, rice is average, assam is average. Not worth the queue, time and effort."
Another SUPER JEM FOUND! THEIR STEAM RICE IS SUPER YUMMY!!! SUPER HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
Chicken is crunchy outside and tender inside. Generous serving of curry
Best nasi kukus ever eaten in spore
Love the selection. A must try.
nice food. halal
Good Malay food
Yummy food with a variety to choose from.
Nice and well dinner
Yummy fried chicken at affordable pricing
Just can do
The brown rice is really good with the fried chicken.  The sotong set is also very tender. It's well cooked but not cheap. For $5.50 would be good if they gave more archar or vegetables. The plate looks a trifle too sparse to feel the luxury of the meal.
Food taste great and was served very fast
Value for money
Great food!
"Had the chicken set and packed a sotong set home. The servings are very generous and the taste was wonderful. The rice was fragrant, soft and moist which is how nasi kukus rice should be, the chicken thigh was cooked to perfection... crispy outside and juicy inside. I was a little disappointed with the sambal which was mild (I prefer super pedas). Overall, I am satisfied with this comfort food and would highly recommend it. Enjoy...."
Fresh juicy chicken meal. 
Cheap and Tasty
Yummy chicken that is crispy in the outside but juicy on the inside
I love it Crispy Chicken ^_^....
Very nice food
It was nice and price was affordable as well
Nice and tasty 
I love the taste! You must try it since it cannot describe by words...
"Wow wow!! The fried chicken is so crispy, and the sambal chilli is 'must have' too - very spicy! Other like squid is not too bad, just ok for the curry chicken. Yet to try the rest."
Very nice fried chicken drumsticks
Food king   
Nice fresh food
"Unique, affordable and taste pretty well. Worth trying something diff"
Very nice & delicious!
To go malay store for lunch
Value for money & delicious.
"Decent food, not perfect , but certain parts of the dish were pretty good"
Chilli pack a Punch. my rice has room for improvement
Great tender chicken!
"Taste ok, spiciness ok!"
Very delicious selections but please maintain the standard!
I love this stall! The curry taste and chilli is superb. Two thumbs up!
Food is delicious. Especially the chicken set.
Delicious steamed rice with a huge chicken.
Delicious. The fried chicken is crispy on the  outside and yet the meat is tender. Great value for money.
The fried chicken is awesome.
The fried chicken is one of the best that I have tasted
I love this
"Great tasting plate of fried chicken with rice, might be overhyped thru social media, but if I'm around the area, would eat again.. otherwise, not really worth the travel.."
Nice place gt air con. Very delicious crispy and juicy fried chicken.
"Fresh chicken, fried to perfection! Chili is sedap!"
Yummy halal food in woodlands
"Fried chicken is crispy and juicy, dont be fooled by the location, its good food."
Nice food at a reasonable price
The nicest tasted so far. Juiciness if chicken is perfectly concealed
Really yummy and tasty! Staff also friendly!
Really good food at affordable prices.
"had set 1 and 2. the fried chicken was fantastic, fish was average but the rice was very densely packed and the curry did not have a chance to sip through it. chilli was good as well."
"The fried chicken set is delicious, however their curry set are awesome. Worth a try."
Food is nice. Must try.
Yummy Malay food that is halal! Heard the rice is steamed specially using metal cups before being served. The result is a slightly sticky/mushy texture. Had it been more fragrant I would have gone for second servings. The fried chicken here are what fried chicken dreams are made of. Think thick crispy skin enveloping juicy chicken thigh meat.
Food is nice and affordable. The fried chicken is extremely tasty
Food is filling and tasted nice. The nasi dagang is not the same nasi dagang which you can fi d in Terengganu.
very delicious. but price abit higher comparing the other food around.
Really good! Too bad the chicken was sold out on that day but I still got to try my friend's one. Both chicken and fish were flavourful and delicious. However the queue was too long
Worth it and damn nice. Rice steam n signature chicken
Very nice fried chicken and curry
"One of the best fried chicken at such an affordable rate. You can choose between the normal white rice or the white rice with brown rice. Had the one with the brown rice and surprisingly, the rice was fragrant. Priced at $5.50. Fried chicken was soft and tender, not only that, its juicy and crispy bringing all dry fried chicken to a shame. Would definitely return for more. They do sell a variety of other proteins (fish, sotong, curry chicken, etc)."
People who come around here should try it . It's very gud.
Nice food. Can choose healthy version.
"Everything thing was awesome! Chicken is crispy on the outside and moist in the inside. U can taste every single grain of ride as you bite into it.
Die Die must TRY!"
Good taste and reasonable price.
Steamed rice is so fragrant and fluffy. Love the curry. Love the mutton. The chilly is simply the best.
Awesome!!! Very pleasantly surprised by how delicious this was. Service was prompt and very good value for money
"Place is cool and nice esp on a warm day.
Mutton was tough and i was dissapointed"
Super delicious! Go try!
Super shiok crispy chicken!
Nothing surprising but the chicken is really big and juicy! Worth it!
"Love it! I am surprise that it is cheap and good! Tried the Fried chicken and it is crispy, tender and juicy. The chili is very spicy too which I like. Many stall that sells similar dish always has dry chicken but not this stall. Must try if you are around this area."
"Try the Set A, the fried chicken is crispy and taste really good!"
Friendly boss and nice food.
"One of the best Malay food I've ever eaten. Highly recommend set 1. Chicken is tasty with the curry and chili combination plus the achar , it's heavenly."
Food said to be great and chicken succulent well to my utter dismay it's dry rice which is supposed to be the main event is wet and very mushy like mashed potatoes
"The food is good. Tried the fried chicken drumstick and mutton curry rice, both are good and value for money. The fried drumstick is always crispy and tender and the mutton is given in generous portion without any bones."
Chicken is not hot and so as curry gravy
Not bad can eat
"Yummy fried chicken with curry. Portions a little small, maybe because you want some more"
Food is tasty
"Amazing food! I don't normally reach for fried chicken, but this I'd eat anytime, all the time."
Chicken is tender and rice is fluffy. Definately must try.
Food was delicious.
"Fei Chang Zhi De Yi Shi,"
Fried chicken is juicy. Their curry is slightly sweet and mild spiciness. Rice is tender and not difficult to eat.
Nice Nasi Kukus
"The old man cashier and the old woman cutting the duck both have bad attitude. Both asked for my orders but turned away to talk to customers outside the counter.  Many times when I buy at this stall I always encounter bad service. Please train your staff otherwise change them. It will eventually affect your business. Moreover, the food quality at this stall has dropped."
"Terrible service from the stall, this morning I went to the stall and it seen ready to serve but nobody in the stall, and i just wait for few minutes, I figured out that the staff chit chatting with someone out there, I try to order with her then she show me the face likes I disturb her chit chatting. I will not go to that stall again in my life. If YEW KEE management doesn't take it serious matter."

"I have lived here for 18 years and had been eating at this stall from its inception here. It went from 5 to 4, and to 2 stars now (Jan2022-now at Oct2022) It's worst than some industrial food court kwaychap now. The only thing that makes it edible is the chilli sauce."
"Pathetic duck meat portion, only 4 thin slices. Diluted soup. Worse yew kee branch ever ."
Not friendly and patient
"The person who took my order was absolutely rude and disrespectful. And also got my order wrong multiple times and when taking my order the people at the back kept talking (probably the reason why they got my order wrong). And the portion size is also very little even though it was $12. Bad experience, will not not recommend."
Hair found...
"Beware of this outlet don't ever buy from them!!
extremely frustrated with the service at this Yew Kee outlet. My grandfather bought duck rice and asked for separate sauce for take-away. The staff, yelled at him and said we had to buy at least 3-4 packets to get separate sauce. The tiny amount of sauce given made the rice nearly inedible. When my grandfather asked for a bit more, she scolded him and refused. We've been loyal customers for years, but this terrible experience means we will never come back."
"The duck meat portion is so thin, few and pathetic! The roast duck at their opposite stall is better."
Very Good Braised Duck and Kway Chap stall. Quite generous at a reasonable price.
Duck rice is yummy but very thirsty after drinking the soup.
Got small fly in the rice. The uncle just change the small portion that the fly is crawling in. Im disgusted
It was tasty and fresh! Would recommend!
"Very bad service from the team. Ordered CNY duck and chicken bundle, Turn out to be vacuum and cold. I'll expect it to be hot and fresh coming from a hawker stall. Only braised sauce is provided and CANNOT get chili."
"ordered their kway chup set ($4.50), & added additional portion of duck meat ($3). the soup of the kway was herbal & savoury, & am in love with their signature chilli! would be back to try their duck rice & duck noodles soon "
"Food is nice but the uncle attitude is really bad, sometimes i ask for more sauce he ignore and gave no sauce"
"ordered two sets to take away. did not know need to pay 20cents for the paper takeaway boxes.

sticker indication was purposely pasted at the side of the wall and totally not obvious.

If they are so hardon to earn money from the paper boxes then i won't patronize them again until they paste clearly the charges for take away."
"I ordered a set menu with additional rice which was still reasonable priced. Only problem is that the chilli is being controlled by them. I asked the guy for more chilli and he only gave me a flat teaspoon full. As for the additional rice, no gravy or chilli was given. I can understand the rising cost. But chilli being controlled? I think that speaks alot."
Your normal yukee duck rice. The kuay chap is nice too. Service is fast.
"Had the duck rice for an incredible economical price of $2.8! There is decent pieces of duck meat. The rice was nice and fluffy and full of flavor. The soup as usual is good.

I think at the current level of inflation, this $2.8 plate of duck meat rice is a steal!"
"I order a drumbstick duck duck rice without cut..when I reach home,the drumbstick is not fully.Dont believe, you can try it on your risk."
"No.1 in the menu ""Signature duck rice"" comes with duck meat, 4 cube of tofu, half egg, some pickled veg, 3 braised peanut, a slice of cucumber, flavored rice and a bowl of soup (dine-in only). All these is decent for $4/plate. Whenever I think of braise duck rice, I will think of Yew Kee. All time value for money."
"Duck rice is too little portion!
And its costs for $2.80!
Don't sell better .
Service also not good.
Staff not friend !
So rude to customer.
Very Disappointed."
Most pathetic portion I have ever eaten. Paid $2.80 for each box and serving size is smaller than my palm... Taste is bland. I wouldn't recommend this stall. $6 for 2 box
"The braised duck was juicy and tender, and the soup was flavourful. The small sides of braised tofu, peanuts, and half a boiled egg were also adequate and the price was very reasonable at S$4 a plate compared to most other stalls. Its drawback is that it's occasionally inconsistent, and the chili was spicy enough but also really oily."
I was shocked to see the portion of duck rice that was so little. I will not patronize this stall again! Staffs of the stall are not friendly!
"The braised duck rice was tasty. The serving size was average. These are my gripes - the large intestine tasted funky each time I ate it. They should clean the large intestine better or change the supplier. The crusted duck is slightly tough and the chilli oil is far too oily, making the braise duck rice unhealthy."
"Good portion size for the price. The chicken meat is tender, juicy and not overcooked.  There is a layer of jelly under the skin which I like most and the chicken is impeccably done.  The sauce drizzled over the chicken is full of flavours.   The chicken rice is not oily.  The rice grains are fluffy and unbroken, infused with unami flavour.   The rice is excellent as it is from a good quality rice not like some stalls. The garlic chilli sauce is perfect too."
"I've been buying from them for nearly 10 years, and the amount of chicken meat has decreased progressively over the years.

I ordered chicken thigh today and was given this thin sliver of meat - where has all the other full thickness of meat gone to? Even if they claim they are boneless chicken rice, it looks like they took off more meat and bone from the thigh and served me a 5mm thick layer.

As nice as it used to be, for the price and the quality and such dishonest business, I will never return again."
"Roasted Chicken Rice ($4) - 8/10
While waiting in line, we noticed many people ordering the roasted chicken, so we decided to give it a try.

 The chicken skin was incredibly fragrant, with a deep, savory flavours from the roasted marinade. The chicken breast itself was tender, juicy, and succulent, perfectly deboned and served neatly on a plate alongside the chicken rice. However, there was a surprising lack of skin, and what little was there wasn't crispy.

The chicken rice had that signature ginger fragrance, with each grain firm yet fluffy, and absorbed the rich flavors of the chicken stock.

The soup was a pleasant surprise, with a deep, rich chicken stock base that's not often found in standard chicken rice meals. It was incredibly savory, umami-packed, and full of robust flavor, offering a delightful contrast to the lighter chicken and rice.

Three types of chili are available for self-service, and we opted for the standard garlicky chili sauce with a citrusy lime kick, which added a nice tangy heat to the dish.

Next time, we're keen to try their char siew and roasted meats, as the roast flavor profile was so aromatic. We also noticed many people ordering their wonton mee, so that's definitely on our list for a future visit.

On the score: Points were deducted from the non-existent roasted skin even though we ordered roasted chicken."
Saw female worker wearing glove counting money just after I paid $8.00 and collected our two chicken rice meals... informed them but they argued back. we threw both meals into bin not wanting to have diahorea or stomach upset. Never return this dirty store!!!
"Ordered the Char Siew Wonton Noodles.
80% of the meat were fats.
Disappointing."
"I ordered chicken rice, added a braised egg a char siew. My children prefers ordering from this stall over the other one. I am not sure why too. The chicken rice is flavourful. There were three condiments to add to your dish."
"One of the best plates of roast chicken rice i have had in a long time. Rice, chicken, soup all on point, and even the coriander on top the rice gets extra brownie pts.

Only slight minus for the chilli, which is good but overly spicy."
"Ordered the 2pax set for $13, come to think of it probably more worth buying 2 meals on its own or a half chicken for $14.

Taste is decent, not a lot of chicken but they give a lot of rice and the chilli is spicy. Boiled vegetables are alright. Extremely full after the meal."
"$4.00 for this bowl of Wanton Noodle w Roast Char Siew. Yi Wan Yun Tun Mian. 

Char Siew 60% fats. Caramised yes but taste so so only. Cha Shao Rou Hen Fei. 

Zhi You Yun Tun Huan Ke Yi. Only consolation is Wonton dumpling is ok."
$7 for a chicken char siew combo that is average. Not worth it.
Nice plate of roast meat! Rice is flavourful too.
Hawker stall food! Good enough and friendly vendors. This is for the yin yang carrot cake. The rolls and soup are from other venders in the complex.
Go for their char siew wanton noodle . The thin egg noodles are qq and the char siew awesome
Rude auntie
"Reasonably good roasted pork and char siew. The cuts of meat were well balanced with meat and fat, and the marinade wasn't too over the top. Roasted meat's skin was crackling. But the rice was quite little - I don't think there was even a bowl's worth of rice in the $4 box.

Also make sure to let the aunty know the price (ie portion) you require, or else she'll automatically assume you're getting the largest portion!"
"Shao Rou,Cha Shao,Hao Chi ,Yun Tun Mian Xiang La Jiao Xiang,Tang Tian,Hao Zan "
"wanted to try a particular stall but unfortunately it they have sold out and have closed. Had wanton noodle from this stall thinking that since this place specialized in HK roast meat, the char siew should be great. It turn out not the case, the charsiew was tough and dry. Noodle and wanton was alright but nothing worth to shout about.

Wanton noodle starts from SGD$3.50 onwards."
Never have I had such dry and tough char siew. Horrible.
Great roast pork. Char siew and roast meat are crispy and with charcoal smell.
"Decent plate of Prawn Noodles , decent value"
"Ordered Char Kway Tiao (it comes w cockles) and Hokkien Mee.

Hokkien mee chili sauce doesn't have the sambal kick and there's more yellow noodles. Both dishes no wok hei.

These two dishes are heavily reliant on personal preference anyway. While not the best I had, it's not horrible."
"first time no need to queue, as I ate this hokkien fried noodle @  Wednesday 4+pm.
It's yummy."
Our favourite Fried Hokkien Mee place. We always come for a plate whenever visiting Katong area. Never disappointed!
"We ordered Hokkien mee and Char Kway Teow. Nothing like the old operator. This China lady's cooking is terrible.  No wok hey at all. Tasteless. The noodles were undercooked for both dishes. Prawns were dry. Definitely not coming back again. Not recommended!  For your info, there is no order/queue unlike the previous operator!"
Horrible. Even free ill never order again. Sgd 8.50 portion is not even for one child portuin. No taste no flavour. Diagrace to hokkie mee. I wrotebim gonna take away n all gravy dripped. Aboalutely disgrace to hokkien mee. Disgusting  bad packing bad taste. Bad portion
Is really sad how the nicest hokkien mee has become one of the most normal you can find. We use to visit here every week for their hokkien mee and also mee sua. We like that the service staff for drinks is really kind and we can bring dogs.
Very delicious
No wok hei. Very basic standard.
Above average Hokkien Mee. Don't come in here expecting it to be as good as it former days.
"It's bad after Uncle and Auntie Pang retired in 2020 and someone else took over, retaining the name. Don't expect the same quality as prior to 2020."
"For the price it is really good omg I can have it every day. I fell in love w the Hokkien mee first , but now I try the Hokkien mee every day "
"One of the worst fried kway keow I have eaten. Chinese sausage got the bad oily bite , taste was blend. Singapore style blood cockles fried kway teow is sweet & savory but this is tasteless . Not sweet not savory.   And the lady attitude is like you own her money. Puling the long face like you own her money.

Never will go again"
"Not like the past (i.e. in the 2010s).  Noodles were stir-fried rather than properly fried, hence it did not absorb the broth.  Prawns not fresh and crumbled once peeled.  Plus is the portions and amt of eggs, but that's about it"
Tried the roasted pork hokkien mee for $8. Big size and good with extra pork lard!
"The fried Kway Teow is not only tasteless & no wok smell plus not even close to the traditional taste at all! My orders was to add cockles and chilli on the side through this lady wearing specs forgot to add cockles which charged me $7/packet l to add? When she pass me, I ask her why no cockles then she say oh usually we add raw on top after cooking. I clearly notice that she is not honest or surely forgotten. Luckily I asked her then she help me to add but when I'm back home she also forgot to add chilli! Believe it or not I think she forgot all my orders when I'm the only one that is ordering and no one was even before me. No wonder sales is bad and no one was ordering from this stall. I will never go back this stall or brand!"
"Very affordable at $6 a plate given its location. Food tastes amazing and portion was super generous. Oysters and hums tasted succulent and fresh, hokkien mee's broth was rich and flavourful, 5 stars."
Tasty Char Kway Teow and Fried Hokkien Mee. Quite big portion at $8 per serving.
"its not the same anymore. The hokkien Mee has not taste, prawn and pork no taste. where is the pork lard?  Disappointed!"
"It is a store within a ""pub/bistro"". So don't get confused when you are there. And it is the corner lot opposite II2 Mall in Katong. The fried hokkien mee is not too waterly type, and with thick prawn fragrance on the gravy. For that area with that environment, the price is reasonable. Worth to come and try if you are in Katong area. Only thing is parking could be a challenge in that area."
"An easy five stars! The quality of food at Yong Huat Hokkien Mee is outstanding, especially for just $6. Compared to other hawker stalls at the same price, this place is unbeatable. It's a hidden gem that I strongly recommend. You won't regret trying it. The best Hokkien Mee around!"
"Tu Jing Jia Dong Fu Jin,Bian Dao Ci Dian Yong Shan,Dian Liao La La Fu Jian Mian Ji Mian Xian,Yi Shi Yi Gan Chao,Tong Yang Mei Wei Ke Kou. "
"Was shown a notice that the squid in the Hokkien mee would be replaced by pork belly. However, while we barely started eating, we realised there's no pork or squid at all. When we went to the stall, the staff said just now no pork and she gave fish cake instead. Utterly ridiculous! Isn't fish cake already part of the dish?? And she could have the courtesy to say at first!

Unethical scam. We ordered the $8 plate."
"Changing times. Changing tastes. We used to come here for the Hokkien Mee and Fried Kuay Teow for decades. I like to encourage and congratulate the new generation for carrying on the legacy of Yong Huat Hokkien Mee.

For the newly initiated, Hokkien Mee and Char Kuay Teow are classical Singaporean childhood hawker creations that goes back to Singapore's early years. It is hard to describe the complex flavours and ingredients. And the heroes that created these dishes during their golden years are mostly retired. The new generation has to carry on the torches as best as they can with their new innovation to the next generation. Happy eating."
"Ordered the Hokkien Mee, medium size at $6 which is now the new small cause the available options are now medium or large. Taste is decent but it is not truly authentic, the type of Singapore Hokkien Mee interpretation you get in Shanghai or Hong Kong. It felt like a fusion of 70% hokkien mee and 30% fried mee. Standard has definitely drop compared to about 2-3 years ago."
Pretty underwhelming Hokkien Mee - even the loaded version with roast pork feels very gelat without much wok hey or flavor. Skip the calories and save it for a better meal.
"Ordered Hokkien mee , mee sua & CKT.
Hokkien mee - tasteless. Totally flat.
Mee sua - so so dry and again tasteless.
CKT - just a plate of kueh teow stirred in soya sauce. When requested for pork lard, staff replied they no longer do it.
Conclusion : no soul of Uncle's recipe at all, disappointing."
"This is a poor pathetic excuse of a hokkien mee.. No taste.. No wok hei.. Some yellow noodles were burnt.. Prawns were not fresh and not deshelled.. No squid (due to inconsistent supply, pffft).. Please do not try"
My wife said she loved it at least 5 times throughout the meal. Hence explain the empty plate. Too late for photo ops. :p
"Ordered the roast pork fried kway teow, no joke one of the best I've ever tried. Perfectly sweet and savoury mix of flavors. "
"It is ok, chilli compensate for it. Oh and maybe it is not as nice as the old couple cooking before."
Yummy fried hokkien mee.
"Tbh not sure what all the one stars are about because this is easily one of my favourite hokkien mees and at a great location too. But given, I don't go around hunting for the best ones nor have I tried the original. All I know with no context, is that this is a decent, tasty Hokkien mee at a relatively affordable price for the area ($6 small, with two fresh prawns). For comparison, Katong Laksa down the road (which I also love) costs ~$7.

I've had it dine in & takeaway and it's always been delicious. With wok hey. Crossing my fingers that this keeps up. Though I was abit disappointed at the lack of pork lard."
"Prawn noodle Is flavourful and taste good. Pricing is reasonable. Prawn was fresh and well-cooked.
Must try! Not those with lots of pork lard. "
"If zero star can be given, I would have rated it as zero. This is not hokkien mee. The broth is tasteless with no prawn or pork taste, the chilli is not even the correct type of chilli, no squid due to cost issue. There is no wok hei too.

The original owner who build Yong Huat good reputation has sold off the store about two years, the new owner retain the name but not the quality."
I hesitated when I saw the tattooed lady frying it for another customer. I should have trusted my instincts. Prawns were fresh. No wok hei. Won't buy again.
"I am so obsessed with the Mee Sua at Yong Huat that I had it for lunch yesterday, had it a for lunch today and then asked for a second plate cos it's that good! Superb wokhey and generous eggs and veg! Goes well with their chili, highly recommend!"
$6 for a really good portion. Many ingredients. Worth it. Definitely coming again!
"First time trying it after the old uncle and aunty sold their recipe.

Char kuey tiao taste plain. No wok hei. No more pork lard.

No trying to be rude. But really feels to me  any coffeeshop CKT is similar or better.

Update;
Second visit to the shop. I miss the previous owner char kway teow!!

Got to the shop. A Chinese lady just sit inside and uses her phone.. like no interest to take order.

Ask for more pork lard like what I use to do.. where I was serve with alot of it by the previous uncle.. now NO MORE PORK LARD!!!!

I came here for the CKT and Pork lard!!

Anyway still decided to give it a try since I'm here.

Portion was pathetic for a $6 meal.. previous owner serve a full pack!

First mouthful, and I know I'll never come back for another CKT anymore.

Best of all.. half way through. I bit onto something hard.. A TOOTHPICK!!!! MY GOODNESS I HOPE NO ONE WAS USING IT BEFORE IT GOT INTO MY CKT!!!

bad.. just plain bad!!!!"
For 6$ It was a very small portion Hokkien mee with no meat ingredients besides the squid and prawn which is not even cleaned. Not worth it.
"Ordered the Hokkien mee via deliveroo and it was decent enough to satisfy my craving but nothing to shout about. There wasn't much of a wok hei flavour to it and I felt that the overall seasoning could be stronger/richer. What's interesting is they use a mix of yellow mee and chu meefen (instead of the usual beehoon) so the texture is also a little different. For those who dislike bean sprouts, you'd be happy to know that they don't fry the noodles with bean sprouts!"
"Disagree with the negative reviews . I've eaten from the previous owners and the current one . Standard hasn't dropped . Flavour is much maintained and comes with big prawns . Tried the fried rice today - super tasty too , albeit on the saltier side but really fragrant . The only grip is the stinginess with overall ingredients ( aside from prawns ) but taste wise is fab ."
"The prawn noodles and mee sia are well fried. With good wok hei. And the lady was also kind enough to try to accommodate my less-salt-less-oil order, arguable somewhat futile as it was by nature of the dishes. Still has a hint of the good ol' Yong Huat taste before Uncle sold the brand, although the options are now reduced. Good effort."
"Like what some of the reviewers said, previous retired owners could really cook up a lovely dish of fried hokkien mee. Wok hey, lard, full of ingredients and at $5. Now, it is nowhere near there and quality has dropped tremendously. It is just like any mediocre, if not below average quality now. There is no $5 option so lowest is $6. And what comes with it is just lots of noodles and REDUCTION of ingredients. No more lard, one tiny strip of sotong with 2 prawns and that's it. No pork slice like before. Definitely not worth the $6 and not coming here again.
It's a shame that the new owner has let greed gotten ahead of the good reputation that was built over years by precious owner."
"Yong Huat has been there for the longest time since I stay in this area. They used to have a fried oyster biscuit which is no longer on sale anymore. I ordered the fried Hokkien Mee and the char kway teow. Both have mild wok hey and also with chilli you can help yourself. Taste wise it's OK, not super exciting. But good enough to satisfy a craving. It's the dry kind of noodles. Some prefer the wet ones. But portion is fair for the price."
Visited my friend shop nearby and found this coffee shop hokkien mee tasty !!!
"Five star for the fried mee suah! One of the best I've had, very delicious. Good amount of seafood and veggies, just right portion, and reasonably priced as well. Ordered fried hokkien prawn mee and yong huat fried rice too. Despite hokkien mee being their specialty, to me it wasn't that nice. Yong huat fried rice was pretty good too though. Will definitely return for the fried mee suah, it's highly recommended!"
best hokkien mee
Oh yes so delicious!!!
"Five star for fried rice. Not the best fried rice in terms of wok hei and separation of rice. But they do make up with very generous of eggs, lap chiong, roast pork, luncheon meat. It's quite salty, but I like. Goes well with the chili sauce. $8 good for 2 Pax."
Prawn mee drop in quality.
"Please read full review. Thanks!
2nd/ Right pix previous owner.(retired)

Previous owner,
Chilli sambal...
The dish was $5
3 mid size prawns, 5 slices of sotong,
About 6 slice pork belly....
Awesome SHIOK!!!!!!!!2
Have been eating for the past several years ..
Standard dropping, Wok Hei missing ...still the Best!!! 2nd pix was my last time there before original owner retired.
It was unforgettable...Plate of Goodness 
In par with geylang stall.

2stars sadly,
1st/Left pix, New owner of this stall...
Is not the same as old.
No pork lard, no slice pork and missing the balacan chill. The noodles has touch of sweet sauce. Prawns need to get your fingers saucey. After taste like I had CKT."
"2nd time patronising them, $8 for the big prawn hokkien mee isn't as fragrant as it was last time. Kind of disappointed, taste average only& the chilli is salty too. Oyster isn't washed clean, still bite until sand.. Char kuay teow is alright only. Overall still alright."
Not bad at all
"Hokkien fried prawn noodle. Fried by a china woman. Disappointed. All I tasted, salty noodle. Prawn not fresh. A lot of tiny black spot on the noodle( is this their wok hey)???"
"SO GOOD. One of the best hokkien mee we've ever eaten, with wok hey on the noodles, savoury sauce and chilli that goes really well with everything :)"
"Very fast the service, staff attentive.... it's "
"$10 Big Prawn Hokkien Mee

Taste was average and the noodle texture is on the chewier side. $10 for four pieces of small prawns that claimed to be big, isn't really something you'd try again."
"One star for the wok hei fragrance but there is nothing spectacular about this so-called famous hokkien mee. The prawns were not fresh and noodle was too salty.  Will not recommend at all.  (By the way, we peeled the prawns ourselves. It was not peeled and you can tell the freshness looking at the condition of the prawns.)"
"The fried hokkien mee is tasty and delicious.  The best part is the wok hei fragrance.  Personally,  i would prefer this to Nam Sing."
"Read about it online and I thought it would be great.
Dabao hokkien mee and fried mee suah. All 3 of us who ate it, agree that its not even worth coming back.
Parts of the hokkien mee were charred."
"Return for the first time since the stall change ownership. Used to go for the heavenly fried mee sua in the past.

Today tapau'd mee sua, fried rice and hokkien mee with roast pork. Mee sua is just ok but lack the usual wok hei. Fried rice a bit salty at times, suspect it was not thoroughly mixed when frying as the cook was trying to manage 2 woks of 2 different dishes simultaneously - the other being the hokkien mee with roast pork which is quite novel and not bad too."
Really disappointed. There goes the taste of childhood
"Very well prepared and have the wok hei fragrance.
Prawns are big, tender and juicy."
"Decent hokkien mee at $5, which is a reasonable price for the area. Not spectacular, but also not bad. Think the fried mee Sua was a bit bland."
Not as good as before.
The taste from the old owners really disappeared.
"Long time customer of this stall, from old owners to new.  Unfortunately a few bad practices of the workers there are prompting me to write a negative review.

Firstly the I don t know how come the cockles (see hum) are now not even fried in together with the kway Teow. Simply added on top of the kway Teow after frying.

Secondly, the workers there are using the same containers to scoop raw ingredients before frying and then reused for takeaway. This is pretty unhygienic and not acceptable.  Just waiting for a outbreak of gastro enteritis to happen.

Dear owner of the store please check up on their bad/ poor hygiene practices before something worse happens."
Best Hokkien Mee with chunky prawns and roasted pork for just 8 bucks!
"Fried Mee Sua is still fairly good even after the old chef had left, but the oyster cakes should be avoided. Soggy exterior (in spite of being left in a warning cabinet) and only one shrivelled oyster in the stuffing."
Would be good if they were to cut down on the oil usage but it tastes good on the overall and would definitely patronise again.  Have not tried it since the takeover but will head back to try the new chef's cooking!  I would put this on East Coast Food Gem's list!
Very yummy hokkien mee and fried kway teow. Reasonably priced as well.
Look good.
"New owners... ordered the $6 portion and still cannot beat the old taste from the previous owners. Well to be honest, hokkien mee had made an improvement since I was here a few months back. Back then they were still trying out the technique. It was not as crowded as before since the retirement of the old bosses. HKM had some flashes of wok hei and the chilli was ok. Added some pork lard which zest up the taste. At least now they let you help yourself with the chilli and pork lard.

Flush it down with a cola!!!"
"Mediocre after the new owners took over in Sep 2020. I gave it 3 months after the new owners took over to allow for some settling in. Just tried it and unfortunately, the standards have plummeted. No wok hei and the amount of ingredients have decreased. Also a lot wetter than the original. Serving size also decreased. The previous owner had, in my opinion, the best Hokkien Mee in Singapore. Now, it's just another Hokkien Mee stall."
"Order was served relatively quickly, no need to wait. Good portion too."
Shadow of its former self... No more wok hei and the chilli has been replaced by a lackluster version of a sambal balachan
"I was recommend to rate this hokkien mee and unfortunately i didn't quite like it. Firstly, The bee hoon was the much too big. The taste was just okay nothing special. I would probably rate this as just ordinary.

I think the noodles need more time to cook judging by the its texture. The one good thing is that you can have as much pork fat bits as you like.

I would like to encourage everyone to go try the hokkien mee over at Beach Road Army Market. They serve the most original and authentic hokkien mee. Just like back in the 70's."
"Fried Mee Sua, Fried Kway Teow. Tried this when the original owners announced their retirement but luckily for many who have yet to try, the owners managed to find someone to take over and will be imparting their wok fried specialty!  It's not often you see fried mee sua being offered and this stall makes it worth to pay with its generous ingredient."
"Happened to passby east coast road this sunday.  There was many cafes, coffeeshop and resturants along east coast road and we chose Yong Huat Hokkien Mee stall inside Alibaba coffeeshop.  The stall not only sold hokkien mee, they do fried rice, mee sua and black kway teow.  The hokkien me just so so to me but the pork lards were fresh and crispy. Will not try again."
"First time to this stall, although just read reviews that the stall owner has changed, it's a shame that I didn't get the try the original taste.
But the fried rice I had was pretty good for me. Especially the sambal balachan is good! (Not very spicy though)"
Standard has dropped greatly. Very few ingredients even for medium size. No longer fantastic.
Food is great
"MEESUA IS FOREVER GONE...

Don't waste time and effort! Since original old aunty and uncle retired, the QUALITY had dropped from 10/10 to Zero!!! Tasteless and ANYONE and ANYWHERE can find rubbish. New store owner still using brand and promo materials which are 10000% UNFAIR to original standard!!!.

RETURNING?? NO WAY."
"22 Aug 2020 - dine-in at 5pm during Phase 2 of Post Circuit Breaker.
3.5 stars. Food 2.5 stars, additional 1 star the lar pok (crispy pork lard).

Came on a Saturday evening just in time for the last batch of whatever they had for the day, which was their fried mee sua. Cooked up by the original owners before they sold off the stall and recipe upon their retirement at end August.

When I placed my order, the younger lady informed me that there's nothing left other than mee sua. I asked ""any lar pok?, she said ""also no more"". I was super disappointed and further asked if she could find any and she managed to scrape up some into a small saucer for me.

The fried mee sua is tasty but not fantastic. The best part of the dish is definitely the lar pok. Without it, the noodles lacks ""umph"". It had a home-cooked taste, but I couldn't taste any wok hei, though flavours of the ingredients blended well. I also found the rice noodles to be a bit clumpy and the prawns overcooked.

Even though I had asked for no chilli, the older lady who served my plate had forgotten and there was a dollop of sambal chilli on the side. As I didn't want to waste any of the food, I happened tasted some of the chili that was on the edge of the plate that mixed with the noodles. The chilli packed a bit of heat but I felt that its taste didn't really complement the noodles.

Will not specifically make a trip to eat this."
I find the Hokkien mee is not really outstanding.  Not really special.
"Below average hokkian mie, big drop on the standard"
The mee sua lives up to its name.
"We came a long way and waited a total of 1 hour from queueing to being served a very mediocre food. Food quality: nothing special. Barely any wok hei in both the mee suah and char kway teow. Char kway teow was overpoweringly sweet. Completely baffled by the 5 star ratings. Service: extremely poor. Random serving
order. People who queued behind us got served first. We had to remind the stall lady twice to serve our orders. Overall a very poor experience, not worth the effort and will never return. Can get better hokkien mee at similar price from food republic."
Epic hokkien mee and fried mee sua!
"As my partner says whenever we drive by, ""can we stop for Hokkien Mee Sua, it's the best mee sua I've ever had in my life."" And that can be after a dinner with a 10 course meal. Suffice to say, this is a definitely must try kinda shop."
Travelled from far West to East to try the fried mee sua before the owners retire. The wok hei had really elevated the taste of this local delicacy! Wish I had more stomach space to try the CKT which many others were seen ordering.
A fried hokkien mee and mee sua stall. Good taste. However closing stall on Aug 26. Boss retiring.
"Mmmm... tasty tasty stuff. Wok Hei game strong!! Lovely old couple cooking, pity they are retiring soon. Try it while you can! Both the Hokkien Mee and Mee Sua are totally worth the calories."
Good but oily.
By far the best fried mee sua I had. Ckt also is solid and can beat some michelin recognised ones. Uncle told me they are retiring end August so come and try one last time before they retire. Thank you for the food and happy retirement. Wishing you health and happiness uncle and aunty!
Best of the best fried Mee sua and Char kway teow! Consistent taste. Should get Michelin star! Uncle and Auntie are retiring soon. Get it while available!
Best Char Kway Teow and fried Bee Tai Mak ever! Try it to believe!
"Extraordinary cooking, the pork lard makes the fried mee suah fragrant and moist. To some may find the chili to be overpowering. I didn't use the chili and only use the lime at the end to clean my palate because it's oily in a good way. Generous portion at $5. What a nice feeling to find a great place to eat. Definitely will come back."
Best fried mee suah in the east
Unusual mee sua but full of wok hei and flavour. It's a rare gem of a dish. I would say it's a like dry smokey version of white bee hoon.
Pretty good but the chillies is too bland.
"Heard from my friends about this stall and how good the char kway teow is and decided to give it a try myself. ( Dun really believe in online reviews sometimes,ahahahahaha).

The Fried Kway Teow was very delicious indeed and fried with skill. However,i will give the Fried Hokkien Prawn Mee there my two thumbs up and gold star.

I could smell and taste the acclaimed and elusive ""Dragon's Breath, more commonly known as ""Wok-Hei"" in this dish. It was in every mouthful that I took. This comes with years of frying experience and skill with the controlling of the fire in the stove, not something that is easily mastered over-night.
The sambal chilli that came with the dish had a zing and a kick as well,and went very well with the noodles,which i thought was a tad bland.

All said,well worth a trip there and a short to medium wait for the food from the lovely and very friendly elderly couple running the stall there."
Fried mee sua
Uncle & Auntie from the store are super friendly.. and of course the char kway teoh is 2 thumbs up with wok hei.
"D uncle told me their signature is fried hokien mee, so I ordered one. Uncle very polite n friendly. quite a lot ordered their fried kuey tiaw when I was waiting.

D taste wise not very bad, slightly above average. Very strong garlic taste wrapping d prawn taste.

D super down side is, a lot of charred pieces in d noodles. (can even c in this photo) I was busy picking out d black pieces of char while eating.

It is d dryer version of fried hokien mee with some of those outside have more gravy. This one don't have. Probably d noodles already soak up d broth I guess.

Goes well with d lime. 3 prawns for a $5 noodles. Not up to 4-star level yet tho, cause of d chars..

Surprisingly they accept cash and nets.. Wow! Cause d guy behind me paid with nets.."
For tourist who don't understand the taste of local food. Their fried Kway Tiao is super amateur.
"A very satisfying plate of Fried Hokkien Mee but I have to say the one at Geylang Lor 29 which is just 2 traffic lights away still set the bar. This stall would be my 1st choice for Hokkien mee if nearby my place but to travel all the way there, I would rather go to Geylang Lor 29. Doesn't mind trying their other dishes though as their fried mee sua seems decent too."
Lunch there quite regularly. Like all their foods esp fried hokkien mee.
"This is the one place I'll travel from west to east to eat. It's super rare to see fried Mee Sua sold elsewhere. The pork lard makes the dish superb. Because there is always a long queue, u gonna wait for your turn. The lady cooks almost everything, hence if there are different orders, then she can only cook them once at a time. The guy cooks only the Mee Pok. So if u r in a hurry, go for the Mee Pok instead. The owners are a friendly bunch. Something rare u see at other popular stalls"
First time came here. Friendly uncle. Good food. Worth the price.
"very good food, boss are really friendly!"
Always good and fragrant char kway teow
$5 for the hokkien Mee. Still good.
"One of the nicest fried kway teow and fried mee hua I've tasted in Singapore. Highly recommend to try it! Generous portion with generous amount of ingredients given. The fried pork lard is one of the reason why it's special too.
Will definitely come back to try it again!"
The Hokkien Mee is great! And the hokkien fried Mee sua
Very friendly uncle and generous portion. Had the hokkien mee but my friend's char kway teow tasted much better!
"Terrible service and food
The staff forgot my order. And when he finally served it, he didn't serve me sauce and spoon

Food wise, it is the first time I can't finish a bowl of bak chor mee"
"I heard of this shop from my friend, who lives nearby. We would go to Alibabar for drinks, and she recommended the mee sua. It's a greasy plate of goodness that would surely increase your probability of a cardiac arrest. However, that's the point of street food in Asia, isn't it? Goodness and guilt in one plate. And it brought me to my happy place. It has that special touch about it. The stall is run by an old Uncle and Auntie. Still has the old-school vibe where they would ask you where you sit, and bring the plate to you. A review is a review. Try it for yourself and see!"
I finished the hokkien mee out of respect for the food. Not sure why someone can give 5 stars for the food. The hokkien mee gravy is watery and the prawn were not fresh.
"I think the char kway teow here is good. I order it with less chili and no hum.

The staff are very friendly, but it takes as while for the food to come."
Old place and not so fresh but food is nice
"Great fried kway Teow & Hokkien mee. Totally worth the waiting time. Expect longer waiting time during peak hours.
Stall sits within a place call Alibabar The Hawker Bar.
Food has the char grilled burnt taste making the kway teow taste really good. And very friendly uncle too =D"
Total disagree with Micheal giving one star. He must have been at the end of star wars galaxy. We are in singapore this is the most biggest bad boy of all char kuay teow. When i told Gid about this big bad boy. The baddest of them all. The whole bus could hear how brave this char kuay teow is. This is the True char kuay teow. Full of lard n crispy n fresh juicy cockles. Its rare for me to eat cockles in full. Except today here. Many ingredients. Large plate. Slight wet with yummy egg black chilli lardddddddy sauce. Its good to go michelin. But my aunty says they have to.open longer hours.
"I had a very bad experience in the flavor and service at this restaurant. The meal took very long to prepare, and was poor flavor and poor value. And to add to this bad experience was the very long time (more than 35 minutes) and they got it wrong, and had to take it back to cook it properly. The person serving this was offended but would not taste it, just replaced it, almost 1 more hour waiting- total of 2 hours overall to have this experience. I did not like this value for money at any price."
Best Kway Teow in Singapore. Nice Uncle. He has been there for 40+ years.
Old school hawker food in a sea of young upstarts. Still the best amongst all the food stalls. The prawn noodles n fried kway teow are very good.
Nice good bowl of kway teow
Keeps dine in diners waiting while they keep letting takeaway customers go first
"I come here very often to buy dishes like beef kway teow, sweet & sour pork ribs rice etc.

Many people say their service and attitude is not up to standard, but if you are a regular, you will know that the people who say that often have attitude problems themselves too, like making trouble during rush hour.

In my years of visiting, i've never had a problem with them.

VERY RUDE AND VERY UNHYGIENIC LADY HAWKER!!!
"Food is bland, attitude and manners are incorrigible! Price also not cheap. No fried rice, not sure they don't know how to fried or what. Go blk 19 coffeeshop zichar better! Avoid this blk 20 market zichar at all cost!!!"
Food is delicious but waiting time is abit long . Especially the curry fish head and pork rib rice
Tasty fried rice
Very tasty hot fun and mee hoon.
"Food is recommend but the service is often felt negative. Not keen of taking my order when I am standing in front for 10mins,doing her own chores and chatting among them and not one instance but almost all occasions. The boss really need to brush up the service of the staffs in order not loose more customers."
"The No. 2 Mee Pok $4/- with pork and fish ball is highly recommended here as it was my first time ordering it after moving into retirement. The pork bone soup was well cook with good taste ""umami"" and I highly suggest this as the best for this area."
Staff attitude no good.
"Their soup is really v deliciouss.. The sliced fish are thicker than other stalls and v tender and well marinated, one of the better fish soup i have tasted before. But this coffeeshop is terribly hot and stuffy, esp if u sit inside and drink their piping hot soup"
"Big portion of fish for the fish soup. Worth it for the price paid ($6) Add on ""small fish"" which is their fried fish paste sticks which is $1. Gave quite a big portion as well"
Gave the wrong order.
"Please do not come to this outlet. Inform the staff that I need a receipt, he refused to provide any form of receipts (give excuses saying that the printer is spoilt and the nets machine receipt can't be given to customer (nets machine receipt can print 2 recept, but he refused to give)

I need a receipt as I help my colleagues to buy, hence u requested for it!

Horrible service provided! Never coming to buy again"

"Cashier looks like she has better places to be. Order dry give soup, asked for and paid for more bitter gourd didn't get any.

Other than that food is decent and very consistent. No other comparable noodle stall here so LL have to eat from them. Just remember to always check your order.

Update: Staff attitude getting from bad to worse. Spoil your day at your own risk. I think closing down soon they very pissed and sad. Such a waste that the food is decent but staff support not there."
nice kway teow fish soup.
"The Kuey Teow soup may seem ordinary, but the taste is surprisingly good. Not only that, but they work at lightning speed, cooking faster than fast food joints! Just be ready to place your order as the cashier swiftly asks for your noodle type, black or white sauce, and more. It's worth it for the delicious outcome! Highly recommended if you are looking for a light meal."

Rude female cashier
More generous portion of fish in fish soup compared to the past! 
Flavour wise it is okay but gives 3 star because the price of $5.5 is steep for the portion provided.
"Food quality is nice and worth the price
But cleanliness is really bad, perhaps because the stall is beside toilet
Last time i ordered delivery, there's flies inside, but i gave benefit of doubt, maybe just unlucky that day
Today i bought this there, lots of flies flying around n store owner like quite chill about it and didnt try to chase away the flies

But taste wise rly not bad imo"
"Avoid this place at all cost. Ridiculously over priced with super little soup. Tabao 2 kway teow soup ($3.50) and when i open the keay teow at home, the whole kway teow clumped tgt liao then very hard to separate even afyer i try to heat up. The soup they also give less than half the container. Come on la, other places the soup they give at least fill until the lid right? Very disappointed that their standards have dropped over the years after opening many franchises around SG."
"Tang Tou Xian Tian,Liao Ye Hen Xin Xian"
"$3.50 per plate of chicken rice, added on a bowl of soup containing white carrot with maze "
"Saw review and wanted to try. The stall is actually located at Yong Ji Bak Ku Teh coffee shop (Teo Chap Bee coffee shop at Blk 19). Don't go blk 18.

Chicken and cha siew were good. Tender and tasty.
Soup is nice, those homecooked feel soup.
Rice a bit drier type but can be more fragrant.
Chili is decent but can be thicker and spicier but that's my personal preference. One of the better Chicken Rice in Woodlands area."
Good tasty soup maybe better than the main dish
"One of the best tasting BBQ pork and roast pork rice I've ever eaten in a coffee shop/ hawker centre. BBQ pork is fragrant with the marinate penetrating the full thickness of the cut. The skin on the roast pork is crispy and crunchy. The serving size is generous. The uncle and aunty are owners of the stall. They make an honest living selling truly genuine quality food cook with their hands and hearts, a very rare practice nowadays. They are from the previous generation of genuine hawkers that sells food for a living, unlike now where many are merely hired to do a job to shove out dishes of precooked 'food'."
The uncle and Auntie is very generous on the potion. They prepared delicious soup. Please support them.
"Have been eating this many years. In 2017 when the market was under renovation, after reno the store was replaced. We were sad. Now we realized they relocated to this coffee shop. Yeah  I can enjoy my chicken rice again. Their soup is no ordinary chicken soup. Must try!"
The owner has moved to the stall to the BLK 18 Teo Chap  Bee Coffee shop.
Ordered the Pork Aburi but halfway eating realised was actually chicken. Notify the owner and got a free replacement. That's what I call customer service!
"Just ordered their Beef Shogayaki Don from FP last evening for my dinner, and wow I was amazed at the taste and the texture of the beef. It was flavorful, and so soft, it was so easy to chew. It went really well with the soft Japanese rice as well. The only complaint however, is that the serving size is too small. It's so good I could literally eat it for my lunch/dinner a few consecutive days, no issue at all. The onsen egg was yummy , cucumber slices were crispy as well. Everything was just so fresh and amazing."
"Food and Service is awesome!!

The Truffle Steak and Aburi Pork taste is super good..

The aburi pork melt (fats) melt in your mouth, the other pieces are very tender too."
Food is good with fast delivery and prompt replies. Will definitely purchase again.
"Woah this was so good! Mentaiko salmon was real flavourful & everything was gr8.

Got it on grab delivery and everything was well packed and tasted great :)

@yiuventuring"
"Says open but was closed.
Owner please update your operating hours. Thanks

"Had YukiDon's truffle steak don and salmon katsu don which has excellent presentation served with yummy soup to complement the rice meal. The steak tasted excellent and cooked to perfection - medium well by default. The salmon katsu don was average in terms of taste, ingredients are fresh. Overall, a good meal but can't give perfect stars for the higher price point based on its location."
Ordered online with food delivery service. Best mentaiko salmon don I've ever had. Generous serving of salmon too
Affordable and tasty
Friendly staff that follows my meal modifications very good food and service
food was delicious and worth your money. 10/10 will recommend!
Yummy food and lovely people!
The coffee shop is very narrow with a lot of tables.
Nice owner to deal with. We had free delivery for our dinner order for 20 pax. Will surely order again in future.
"10/10. Ordered from Food Panda and unlike other establishments the don looks EXACTLY like its picture, if not better. Good taste, good portions, fair price.

Its in a hawker centre, what more can you ask for?"
"Delicious Salmon Mentaiko Don, absolutely love it & wished that the portion to be larger, maybe I'm just too hungry hahaha  craving for more "
"Solid quality for hawker fare! More pricey than usual coffeeshop food ($9 - $12+) but tbh, you'd pay more for the same or less in the CBD, so I'm not complaining."
"I got the chicken cutlet set. Super good for $8.90 and prettt filling. Miso soup was real good and definitely the top few in coffee shops. Stall owner was so nice and gave my friends and I a serving of fried salmon and oh my it was so freaking good. I really recommend this stall as it serves great comfort food but it's slightly towards the higher pricing.

14/05: wow first time I got the wagyu steak and OMG! BEST food I have ever had. Honestly my favourite comfort meal. The taste of the beef with the egg and soup was just a phenomenal combination that really is so addictive I'll be coming back often for it. Hands down the most consistent food outlet I have experienced."
"$8.90 for the smoke duck don.
Smoke duck taste great, rice still quality ok, egg nice.
Not very filling but overall value for money ok."
Love their salmon don and mentai gyoza !
"It was unusual to try a dish such as this one from a hawker stall, but it was a delightful experience that will keep me coming back again and again. A generous serving of salmon was accompanied by an onsen egg and rice and even garnish (sliced cucumber). Yuki Don also have this in chicken, ebi fry or Iberico (pork belly) variations. Try one of these offerings. It's as good as it gets!"
"A hidden GEM in a coffee of woodlands. Nxt to Siling Pri Sch. The food is good & delicious, our regular stall to visit. Standard consistent. Friendly staff too."
"The staff was very friendly. Decent amount of waiting time for the food to be ready. The price is expensive for a coffee shop but for what you are buying, it is justifiable. As I had this before the dinner crowd, the atmosphere was quite chill."
Have ordered multiple times. Food is delicious and consistent
"Ordered an Ebi fry don. Looks appetising at first glance but when I started eating the ebi fry, I thought I got the wrong order because I could not really taste any prawn. Cut the ebi fry into half and only saw a tiny strip of prawn in an excessively thick layer of flour.
Not recommended. Not coming back too."
Food are hot and portion quite big. Will come back again to try their other varieties.
"Hidden gem in Woodlands! All their dishes are served with a runny egg and are absolutely delicious! Price is a bit steep, but it is well-worth it.
Would recommend their miso pork and truffle beef cubes that are tender and packed with flavour."
"My favourite Japanese coffeeshop stall around my neighbourhood! Price is slightly steep for a coffee shop stall but their food is undeniable tasty. I love their Mentaiko Salmon Don, it's my no 1 go-to favourite order here. Highly recommended for those who love Mentaiko and Salmon! Their Mentaiko Sauce is very flavourful, their salmon is well-cooked and their rice tastes good too. Another dish that's not bad imo is their Unagi Don.

Overall 4/5  Their standard has surpassed many other Japanese coffeeshop stalls in my neighbourhood! "
I love YukiDon!  I had salmon mentaiyaki don and it was cooked to perfection 
Really good!
"Food was serve piping hot and delivery was on time.
My 2nd time ordering.
All worth n will sure to order again.
Recommend"
"Wonderful dons at a reasonable price, definitely worth a try!"
"Very disappointed with them.

Ordered online at 4:45pm and patiently waited till 6pm with no news, then out of a sudden cancelled my order without any reason or apologies.

Irresponsible.

Edit:
After calling grab to check, I am glad to know that grab was the one who canceled the order but showed to customers on app that the restaurant was the one who did that. We all know who's the irresponsible one now.

Aside from order issues which ended with my gastric flaring up, the food from Yukidon is always served hot and delicious. The price point is also on the reasonable side. Replying to my review with reasonable explanation was appreciated."
"Tried their teriyaki chicken don when they started operation but was not impressed. Today, decided to give them a second chance and ordered their spicy miso pork don. The meat was really tough and there was one cube of fat (see photo); another piece of pork cube had bones in it. For $9.90, I can get better food from other stalls in the same coffeeshop.

Update 2 months later: Gave the stall one last chance. Tried their iberico pork bowl as many of the reviews claimed it was good. Basically a bowl of savoury but overpriced pork bowl. Ok, that's my last time patronising them."
Super super good. Had the truffle steak and it was legit. Restaurant standard and the onsen egg was on point and it just elevated the whole dish to another level. Miso soup was warm and goes well. Totally worth it
"Love their truffle steak don, very strong truffle smell, I like it but some find it a bit too strong. Egg done nicely, runny and goes well with the rice. Also enjoy their ebi fry don, price to taste ratio generally quite worth for most of their bowls."
Highly recommended! Very generous portion of food and taste was on point.
reasonable price
Amazing Japanese foods around neighborhood coffeeshop. Very generous amount given and also good quality and taste. Highly recommended for anyone looking for affordable neighborhood Japanese foods of restaurant standard.
"Super solid salmon bowl. Ordered from grabfood and I was pleasantly surprised to find such a hidden gem in woodlands! Salmon was so soft & fresh, portions are big. Mentaiko sauce is super good as well, it resembles the mentaiko sauce from genki sushi for me. Would recommend everyone to try!"
"Had their salmon mentaiko don, cook on the salmon is perfect! Much better quality and portion than many established restaurants out there. Will come again"
"A hidden gem in the heart of Woodlands.

Ordered via delivery. Although I only ate it after an hour (not the fault of the delivery to be clear), the food was still very good and moist."
Great tasting iberico pork rice bowl. Rice isn't flavored. Would've been good if they flavour it.
"Good truffle yakiniku beef don and iberico don. Price on the higher side. Would have appreciated some veggies apart from the 3 pieces of cucumber given, for the price paid."
"Really love their truffle steak don and salmon mentaiyaki!! Ordered several times for family dinners and the food standard has been consistently good! It is a little pricey for a coffeeshop stall but I guess good stuffs don't come cheap, will continue to support!"
"Ordered 3 Yukidon via Food Panda with 20% off, so overall is cheaper than the listed price and don't need to queue up. Truffle Steak is amazingly nice~ didn't try Salmon but looks good... overall portion is quite adequate"
Very friendly staff and management.  Good service
Food prices are too pricey to be located in a neighborhood coffee shop.
"Ordered the     ($.). Taste was ok, truffle was evident though not overwhelming. Steak was also adequately cooked.
However, it is on the pricey side for a hawker stall. Would be 4 stars if it was a few dollars cheaper."
A little bit expensive in hawker. However the quality is so good. Quite authentic flavor in Japanese cuisine
"Taste: Food is really good and tasty. You have an assortment from standard teriyaki Don, ebi Don to even more speciality ones like iberico and unagi. Food quality is top grade especially for hawker centre.
Price: Price is a little bit on the high side as the dons average 9 bucks, which comparing to your other dishes at the place like ban mian at 4 dollars, it's pricy.

Overall, good food and service!"
"I ordered the ""karaage"", the reason why I put the open inverted commas was because what they served me was something else totally. It looks like bits and pieces of popcorn chicken with a lemon wedge. I always want to support young hawkers but it was a disappointment."
"Ordered the truffle beef don. Great portion for the price, but slightly light on the truffle aroma."
Their truffle steak don and spicy miso pork don are my favourites. Very nice 
Great food! Ordered it tdy for my fam and my mom really liked the salmon mentaiko and i too enjoyed my truffle beef steak. However one suggestion i can provide is that the rich given is really too much..... Maybe can reduce the amt of rice and add in some greens like broccoli and stuff. Overall still highly recommended :))
"My wife was craving for something else from this food court and Yukidon caught my attention. While most of the items were slightly cheaper than similar Japan rice bowls in the CBD, they were pretty generous with their servings of the Teriyaki Chicken that I ordered ($7.90). Thought that they could do with a little less Teriyaki as it was a little too salty for me. Despite this, I'll still like to try the other type of meat that they sell."
"The food delivered by Grab delivery was served really warm. All the rice bowls came with a runny onsen egg. My favourite is the Yakiniku Beef Don, follow by the Mentaikoyaki Salmon. The Unagi Don is quite good but the taste is on the sweet and salty side. The serving is big and filling. Even though their prices are restaurant standard, the taste is more superior than most Japanese restaurants. Thumbs up!"
Amazing taste! Rice to meat ratio could be improved! Would recommend.
Friendly owner and yummy don
"Amazing taste Japanese don in a kopidiam.
Will be back try others."
Delicious food and great service 
"Though prices are a little steep, it's worth a try. Like their mentaiko salmon in particular."
All foods from this place is amazing and delicious
Best food is a must try yukiDon 
Yummy salmon mentaiyaki. Truffle steak is good too.  Will be back for more
Must try to know 
"Really great food!! Yummy!! Beef, salmon mentaiko and Unagi really shiok!! Have been trying so many times!! Great job YukiDon "
"Ordered via grabfood 2 weeks back, decided to leave a review because it's not easy to find good food here in the area.
Had the salmon mentaiko rice which was very nicely torched. Mentaiko taste was great too.
Rice portion is quite a lot though.

Will definitely reorder again and try other items."
Had it the 2nd time already. Food is nice.. Price reasonable. Portion is big... Definitely a must try.. will go back to eat or order again....
Good Japanese rice sets. Must try.

Fishball noodles dry taste not bad
Noodles was well-cooked with a good texture. Seasoning not too strong. Meatballs was chewy. Minced meat was soft and nice. Not bad!! Will come again.
Nice and traditional bak chor mee. The mee pok was well cooked. Not too long but just nice. Highly recommended bak chor mee at this hawker centre.
Noodles are springy and savory
1st time trying bcm mee pok from this stall. Seems to be helmed by a young man cooking the noodles. Price reasonable $4. Mee Pok very Q too. Can separately add more vinegar if required. Taste good.
"Had the noodles multiple times already. Family operated with the son helping his parents.
I want to support local hawkers and youngsters (and the noodles are pretty good too)"
Taste average. Maybe will try the signature next time.
One of my top favorite noodles in Singapore. Taste is very traditional and authentic with springy noodles. Highly recommend the dry mee kia version.
"Decided to give this BCM stall a try.
Noodles texture average. Fresh ingredients. But, braised mushroom lack of flavour. Soup taste not bad.
Can give it a try."
Have eaten here a few times and the auntie at the stall is always so kind and nice! I really like their BCM although their fishballs are bouncy and light but can be a bit bland. Price is very affordable as well. Definitely recommended!
I didn't went in
Well balanced taste. Can eat this everyday 
"Mee sua was under seasoned, minced meat was chewy though braised mushroom was flavorful.
Pork ball seemed factory made
Soup was like flavored water.
For $4, the portion and ingredients are miniscule.
Given the high reviews it is puzzling and disappointing"
"Today's bowl was cooked by the son and was cooked to perfection with springy noodles and meat for my liking. Encouraging to see young people master this trade and dish, keep it up!"
"Looking for classic Gu Zao Wei flavor? This was one of the Bak Chor Mee to try from the old ways. You would not find the usual franchise flavor but cooked by the owner themselves. You could see a youngster taking the reins and cooking for you. The dried flavor was great and on spot for old style noodles. However, the noodles could be better if washed more to remove the ""ki"". Overall, it was worth a try as I find myself returning for this noodles"
"This stall is manned by a friendly youngster and his parents. In my opinion, the youngster overcooks the noodles by a bit. Noodles are a bit soggier and they do not have a bouncy bite to it. He also adds a little bit too much soup when mixing it with the chili. When the uncle (his father) cooks it, the noodles are slightly more dry and just right for my liking. Coupled with the vinegar, I really enjoyed every bite of the mee pok with chili. The pork is well marinated and tenderly cooked. The meatballs on the other hand, sometimes are too hard or just nicely cooked.

Overall the BCM is pretty good."
"One of my favourite BCM in Woodlands marsiling area. Everything are perfectly crafted. Noodles are springy, fish balls are so fresh and bouncy, the Minced meat are perfectly well marinated with sole dried fish which gives additional punch. The pork lard is crispy and gives out aroma. Well done!!!"
"Competent, conscientious in cooking and serving but bland tasting.
I suspect they believe high blood pressure is caused by salt."
"Zeng Ji has been my go to chicken rice stall in the MP hawker Centre since I discovered it. Had the roast chicken rice today and I must say I prefer their white chicken. It's great value at $4, &4.70 with egg. There's nothing to complain about. The soup is super yummy. Tow gay only $2. A good affordable meal for these inflated times."
"Best Hainanese chicken rice in the hawker centre, in my humble opinion :)"
Very tender white chicken. They have moved to unit #01-52
best chicken rice in the area
Fairly decent
The chicken rice so good. Steamed chicken over roasted but both are nice. The rice is fragrant.
the chicken is green
Affordable and yummy chicken rice at marine parade market food centre. Expect long q durung lunch time
"Food is ok but the service sucks!

Despite a long queue, they let their preferred customers cut queue- regular customers or other stall vendors.
How can that be!??  Allowing queue jumpers.
For that they get 1-star"
"Just finish the food.

This chicken rice is not boneless at all providing the stall's name is boneless chicken rice 

Asked for big bowl of soup was declined and told that was the big bowl. The big bowl is just beside.

Tastes wise = just another chicken rice stall in hawler standard. Dont know what and where is the hype for this.

Price = half a chicken + drumstick (shrink on the size) with 2 rice is not worth.

Need to queue for 15 mins. Dont think is worth the wait.

Attitude = auntie ah... (if you tired or not willing to work, please go home and rest. Ppl dont owe you a living)

Skip this stall and go parkway parade for better food"
Surprised by the white chicken rice here. Both chicken and rice are good.
"I chanced upon this shop with a queue during lunch time and decided to try. Oh my, should I have known about the quality of the food- I'll definitely not have queue to try a lousy plate of chicken rice. The breast meat (I've requested for thigh by the way) was very tough and the chilli very diluted. Why are people queuing for lousy food? Will definitely give it a pass and try other stalls next time."
"There is quite a queue for it but it tastes surprisingly mediocre, just very very average. You can skip the queue and go for some other nearby ones with no queue and it will likely taste better."
A value for money chicken rice at Marine Parade area. A plate of flavorful drum stick chicken rice cost $4.50. I find the chilli sauce too watery. Long queues and service is slow.

"You cannot take the ginger despite they put it outside. Because the old lady will scold. I wanted to out the ginger on my rice, she say i am not suppose to do that. So why did they put it outside for us to take for? There are many other chicken rice there, used to like this stall but no more next time. The one beside wanton mee and fruit juice stall is way more friendly."
"TL;DR: Tried 2 out of 4 chicken rice stalls in Marine Parade, and this one is a mixed bag. Got its highs and lows. Locals swear it's the best, but I've got thoughts.

Food
 Ordered Half a Chicken
 The rice is solid--flavorful and well-cooked.
 Chilli sauce tastes like chilli but isn't spicy--bit of a letdown.
 The garlic sauce is tasty, but the garlic flavor could've been stronger.
 The chicken is inconsistent. Parts with skin and fat are juicy, but the rest is dry. Dipping it in sauce helps with flavor but not the dryness.
 The chicken sauce is decent at first but gets salty after a while. Had me reaching for plain water or a teh o kosong peng to balance it out.

Service
Oh boy, this is a tough one:
 Accommodating! Gave an extra plate when asked (unlike stalls that charge 10 cents for one--yes, really).
 Asked if I wanted a big soup bowl or two small ones--thoughtful.
 Accepts multiple payment methods, including PayNow, PayLah, and Marine Parade coupons.
 Saw a housefly land in the chicken prep area. The person cutting didn't even shoo it away--it touched some items before flying off.
 Big orders kept getting messed up. While not my order, I noticed food for others was left out for at least 3 orders before mine.

Atmosphere
 Flies buzzing around--not great.
 Long queues.
 Typical noisy hawker center vibes.

Overall: The food's decent for the most part (my mum loved it), but the fly situation and service hiccups are hard to ignore. Let's just say I didn't tell my family about the fly incident."
"Very fragrance rice. The roast chicken was very tender. A good version of chicken rice at decent value pricing. Expect to queue for it. The queue might be long but the reasonable fast.

Worth a visit if you're in a vicinity"
"Decent plate of chicken rice. In this Hawker there are a few stalls selling Chicken Rice. General quality is good here.

Just be ready to queue up and patiently wait."
This (small) hawker centre has four chicken rice stalls. First time here and chose to go with this stall. Not bad and portion was quite a lot. $4 for this
"One of the best chicken rice in town. Fragrant rice. Smooth steamed chicken
Chili is ok."
"There are 3 chicken rice stalls in Marine Parade Central Hawker Centre, all are good. However, this is the only boneless one, which I prefer.  Chicken is nice and smooth, rice is fragrant.  The only issue is that for boneless chicken, each order will take a longer time to prepare, hence the long queue during lunch time."
$14 for half chicken is a real steal. Eat until very shiok.
"Best quick fix $3/$4 plate of chicken rice.
Rice flavourful and not mushy, its those Gu Zao Li Li Fen Ming type
Chicken succulent and served boneless
Chilli packs a punch
Bonus hot soup for your in case you choke cause you are downing the plate so quickly."
Great chicken rice at $4. Rice is fragrant and chicken is tender. Good quality for this price.
"Any delicious hawker always come from the first image of the hawker. They are friendly and patience with our orders.

The authentic Hainanese chicken rice fragrance is unforgettable, it's boneless chicken which is super convenient for everyone including kids.

Their chicken breast meat texture is just like thigh meat. The tenderness is something you hardly can find. Senior citizens likes it you know why, children loves it because it's boneless and working adult best choice is because it can satisfy their expectations.

They have steam chicken and roasted chicken which are both popular. They have chickens innate which has a good doneness which taste good as well.

Chilli is another secret to it which they have their recipe to it which makes it taste so flavorful with the rice.

Must try."
Chicken was rather tender and the rice was really good 
"Decent chicken rice at a relatively ok price point. Smaller portion at $3.30 while the bigger portion is at $3.80.
The chicken is juicy and tender.
The rice can be better. Texture is great but lacks flavor compared to others.

Chilli and ginger were great."
"Had to give this a try after seeing such a long queue. Waited for 15 mins. Luckily it's worth the wait but any longer is not worth it. The rice is cooked to perfection with strong chicken flavours. However, the chicken meat is a let down, it's abit hard and bland, you will need a lot of chilli to elevate the taste. Overall, good plate of chicken rice."
Rice no taste of chicken rice taste and soft as normal steam rice. White chicken meat no favour. Ji Wei cost 3.80. Normal is 3.30. Only the soup is nice.
"Located at Marine Parade Central, operated by ex-Boon Tong Kee chef & his wife. His children comes help out during weekends. Rice are soft and fluffy, while chicken are tender and goes well with the chilli sauce and cabbage soup. Taste very similar to Famous Boon Tong Kee chicken rice. Expect long queue during lunch peak hours. Price from $3.30 onwards for small plate. Cash & e-payment accepted."
"Nice plate of Hainanese chicken rice.
You will find a queue at this stall almost every time. One of the more popular stalls in the hawker centre.

At around 2PM on a Saturday, the wait time was about 15 minutes. Queue moves pretty quickly.

The rice tastes really good, and even better with the chilli. The portions of chicken were soft, chose the roasted chicken option."
"This is one of three chicken rice stalls
located inside the Marine Parade Hawker Centre.

Prices are reasonable (SGD3.80 for a plate of chicken rice with chicken thigh meat) whilst portion is above average.

Whilst the boiled chicken is silky, the rice was a bit hard and not enough fluffy. The chilli sauce does not pack enough punch and the sour taste that is usually expected of.

Overall, pretty decent and good to satisfy your hunger pangs."
This outlet is located at Marine Parade hawker centre. Their boneless chicken meat is really taste good. The price is also reasonable in term of the given portion. I will return again when I'm there. 
"Writing this while having my first ever Hainese (roasted) chicken: yummie! Just SG$3.50 for a generous portion of rice&meat. Will return for more! Thank you, chef!"
I like mine boneless. Somehow makes it all so much more worth it. I hate it when a plate of chicken rice is mostly bones. All the condiments were there for the taking. The portion was quite generous for a $3 plate.
Its QUITE GOOD! TOOK THE ROASTED CHICKEN and it surprised me somewhat. The rice was flavourful without being too mushy. The chicken was just about nice! The real DOWNSIDE: because it is chicken rice...inevitably need tray to put the entire single order and tray costs an extra $0.50. This is redunded upon the return of tray but its just the additinal hassle.
"should be one of the new stalls that have just moved in to the newly renovated Marine Parade food center. Understand that previously it was at Kaki Bukit food centre. Had the roast chicken,which i think the meat was a little dry and tough for my liking, however i do enjoy the rice alot. very aroma and nicely done. Understand that their poached version is better, if i do drop by again, I will definitely try it!"
"This is probably the most popular , affordable and offering the most varieties vegeterian stall in north region, the wok hey is awesomely good if you like oriental Zi Zar foods, you will be spoilt of choices from popular local, Sichuan and western fusion style. This stall offers value for money meals to all
Vegetarian and non vegetarian patrons."

Good vegetarian food with vegan options. Wish the service was as warm as my food though.
Nice vegetarian coffeeshop with veggie versions of all Singapore staples. Bit out the way but no complaints. Very cheap too
"Vegetarian Hor Fun was filled with smelly eggs!
Don't call it vegetarian if you are adding eggs!

Same with vegetarian olive fried rice... smelly eggs

Please mention clearly if egg is used!!! Not clear in online order!!"

The food suit my grandmother
"If you are desperate for veg food, you can try one time. If you can tahan to go home eat Maggie, pls do so. If you have no taste buds, then it does not matter."
Poor service even after so many months have past since the change of new owner. Alot of room for improvement that need to be done to achieve the same standard as the previous owner.
"Nice vegetarian hawker food in Marsiling. Tastes good, and prices are affordable. I personally recommend their laksa (available every Wednesday and Sunday only) "
"Nice food,"
"I stay at next block and my favourite stall. The staff and the cook sometimes give me very bad stuff. The food is not same as I ordered or the staff forgot to add the requested things. I feel very bad about their double standard.  I don't make any trouble with them. Why? I paid and waited for the food, even they serve the big orders 1st. Nothing is fare in this world.  I will try not go there."
"EDITED POST to comment on the service - it a fact that many of customers found the ex owner & helpers are excellent in their service , BUT not the current team of helpers, they are neither service oriented nor friendly- the reason of giving 3 stars now is because of one of ex-owner staff ""Chai Ling"" still working with  the new owner, otherwise this stall deserves just 1 star on service, and hope the new owner do not just focus on business profit alone, able to provide quality and healthy vegetarian food and good service should be your focus to continue this legendary business name from the ex-owner.

New owner with a large variety of choices. The best is the stall opens daily from morning to night hours. Food quality and taste is reasonably good, price is higher than previous owner but this is understandable, standard from $5-$6 depend on chosen choice."
"Since the change of owner, things were different.
Bad service from a younger lady (not young). Never had such problem with the aunties."
"Plenty of choices for Vegetarians and Vegans. From zichars to mixed vegetables dishes. Go for their Thursday Special ""Mee Rebus""! Sedap! Closed on Tuesday."
"(2023) The vegetarian laksa was good. Only available on Wednesdays and Sundays. Tried their fried Hokkien mee as well as mixed vegetable rice, tasted so-so, not as flavourful as I had expected.

Update (April 2024): Very rude service from the aunties and the young girls helping out at the stall. Super stuck-up and talked in a rude manner. Didn't even make any eye contact. Yaya papaya. Served others who were behind me despite me standing in front of the stall. That's it. Won't be patronising them anymore."
Ordered before others but others get their food first. Super long wait despite I ordered 1 plate of fried rice and 1 plate of beancurd. Unpleasant experience.
"Today is our 4th trip here.
Foods still as delicious 
Portion are enough to fill our stomach & the
price is reasonable.
Wanted to order the black beans tofu but was told not everytime have n this black beans tofu dish contain eggs...

Today celebrated Mothers' Day so ordered 8 dishes of foods ( hokkien mee, 6 dishes n 1 soup...) All very nice 

Parking not an issue.
Near to bus stop too."
New stall owners provide many varieties options choices
Many choice of vegetarians  foods.
"After change of owner, the taste of food quality dropped drastically."
"Cashier cheated an old man and took 10 sgd for a meal and asked to pay more as he only took 4sgd. It was a meal that is supposed to be 5.30. With 4.70 change but he forgotten while talking to another customer and refused to return the change, while demanding for more payment as he was only holding the 4sgd in his hand. Paid 11.30 for a 5.30 meal."
Nice and cheap
"A popular vegetarian stall in an obscure kopitiam that offers daily special menu besides the usual beehoon and sides. On the day of my visit, the stall were serving this yummy vegetarian Kway Chap for only $3.50. The rice sheet are silky smooth and the broth is flavourful. As this dish is prepared only upon order, do expect a waiting time of about 10 minutes. 10/10 worth it."
"Good variety of food.
Friendly auntie despite it was busy morning.
Would say the taste was good and the price was competitive"
"tried the fried bee hoon a standard local breakfast in singapore.
it's very nice, with the local fried bee hoon must add signature crispy tofu skin to complete meal. thumbs up"
"Have been eating at this hidden gem for a long time! Staffs are friendly and food is yummy, a must try!!"
"Great Vegetarian Zi Char!
Simply the Best Xing Zhou Mi Fen Singapore Fried Bee Hoon!
Can taste the fullness of Wok Hey and not too oily. Great taste."
"Very tasty!! My go to vegetarian store. The wok hey is insane, very tasty. I go for the tze char like dishes. Favourites are sin chow beehoon and their white kway teow ( w chilli )"
Food is nice
Good food & reasonable. Will come again.
Is been quite a while to come back here for my all time favorite Sin Chew fried bee hoon. I consider this best in Asia. The wok hey is just too irresistible. For just $4 it's really affordable without having to pay restaurant price.
"Nice vegetarian food, they serve economic fried bee hoon, hockkien mee, hor fun. On different days, they have mee rubus, laksa, lor mee..."
Very nice laksa only on Wednesday and Sunday
Hokkkien mee is not bad but due to the recent increment of price make it a bit sian to go and have it. 3.50>4.00 but not bad still
"Nice vegetarian , can try the Malay stall curry puff is crispy and nice (:"
Good and affordable Chinese vegetarian food. Dont forget to try their Laksa on Sunday mornings. Be prepared for crowd in the weekend morning.
Nice hor fun and hokkien mee (white). Very reasonably priced too. There are variety of chu char dishes. Will visit again.
The food at zhen xiang vegetarian is very nice and will always go there eat.
Yi Ban Shang Zai Zu Wu Qu Ye Hen Fang Bian. Jing Ji. Hao Chi. 
Food not bad especially their hokkien mee
Customer at heart. Never failed to amaze me with their customized services.
Great foods 
I can't rate this store because I do not consumes non halal.
"Love the mee hoon kuey, it tastes like home."
Best vegetarian food I eaten so far.
Vegetarians food and India nasi goreng nice
Normal vegetarian food
Food was good and economic
"Food is yimmylicious and very reasonably priced.  Love the lor mee, fish bee hoon, laksa, kuay chap, and the list goes on. Don't believe me? Go try out the food yourself."
"I like Mee Rebus & Lor Mee,  Must try then you will know why!"
This stall has been here for almost 15 years. The food is great.
"Food are OK and fast, but only open till around 2pm."
Delicious and cheap bee hoon with excellent chicken chop.  Attached enough for two $9
"$3.50.
Feeling queasy after consumption.
Won't be going back
No hair found fortunately"
"2nd time over the course of a year that I found hair in my beehoon. Stopped eating here for a while and decided to give it a go today again.

While I understand that stray hairs can be inevitable - I think the owners have to be cognizant if they are prone to this and wear suitable gear.

With lacking hygiene standards - portions, taste and value are irrelevant."
"Great caifan (mixed vegetables rice) stall. Had their beehoon for breakfast, they had other selections available like mee, white beehoon, fried beehoon, kuay teow, etc. The fried chicken cutlet stood out for me, it was juicy chicken thigh fried to perfection. The bittergourd with eggs were one of my favourites too, and also the curry vegetables. Queue might seem longer but it moves quickly as they mostly have 2 aunties taking orders."
"Mei Tian De Zao Can,Bai Mi Fen "
Delicious mixed vegetables rice. Seperate menu for breakfast and lunch. Friendly stall holders. Must try!!
"The satay here is really a pure delight. If you are a satay lover, and have been going places to savour various satays, then this place is not to be missed. What amazed me is the entire presentation and quality of the satay and the accompaniments. The pork satay is fresh with right amount of fat and grilled perfectly. They use freshly boiled ketuput, though not as authentic as the palm leave wrapped one, is soft and yet bouncy. Not only the satay is piping hot, the sauce is also hot, which goes to show the effort put into making the food. I have not tried the chicken wings but it sure looks very tantalising. Will definitely come back again and again."
"proper defrost is done before bbq . it take awhile but worth waiting . chicken wing is done just right . not too wet or hard on the inside . the skin is crispy thin . the satay seasoning and marination is between the chinese stay and malay satay. well balanced .
satay is $0.90
chicken wing is $1.30"
Surprisingly good satay hidden away in Duman Food Centre on the 2nd floor. Gravy is actual hot and they are not stingy on the cucumber and onion. Satay is done to perfection!
"Very nice satay, each stick may be a little small but taste delicious. Owner very generous with the cucumber, onions and the gravy

Return here to try again, satay is as good. Tried the chicken wing, not too impressed with it, too dry.

Otah is nice from this stall"
"DELICIOUSNESS GUARANTEED

I've been here more often recently at this friendly satay stall and the quality never waivers. Service from the satay lady is lovely! Delicious and authentic satay's hard to find which makes this stall even more of an invaluable gem in the East. Cannot recommend highly enough! Please give her satay and otah a try, you won't be disappointed."
Super wings!!! Cooked to perfection & wings hv a very unique taste that keeps u coming back for more. A very nice & quiet old skool ambience too for dining in. Definitely highly recommended. 5
"Do not know why so little reviews from this stall.

Been here for satay a few times.

One of the best satay in this region. if you love onions and cucumber with it, you are in for a treat."
Can get your Singaporean chicken wing fix here
"My go to food when I have no clue what to eat, the fried fish soup with milk is tasty, peak hours waiting time is longer."
Very yummy with hugeee portion of fish. Totally worth the price
Very good fish soup! Stall is underrated in Woodlands. Plus it operates 24hrs! Indeed a rare find!
"Hearty bowl of fish soup, portion of fish slices is good and broth is tasty.
Doesn't feel much thirsty after drinking all the soup. Definitely will return again to try the other variations."
"Let me just say - it is an expensive bowl of fish soup. $6.50 for fish soup and $1 for rice seems pretty absurd - My internal limit is usually $5.50 max for fish soup, rice can be $0.50.

Still, I wanted to see if the fish soup could justify its price point, and justify it did.

I ordered (sliced) fish fish soup with milk.

Taste - The soup has a sour , like a ginger XO sour hint. Personally, taste wise soup was pretty good, hitting al the spots for fish soup. Taste was strong enough for my liking.

Fish slices - Highlights were clearly the batang slices. At $6.50, I took it upon myself to count the number of slices. After all, base price for $6.50 is not cheap. And their slices are the thick, chunky kinds which I like for that added bite.

I counted, and there were 10 slices. For value, this is really worth.

They have a fried shallot condiment which I took at will (I mean, its $6.50). I enjoyed placing it on my rice for a change in texture.

Overall, it boldly shows why its worth the $6.50, and it really is - both in quality ad quantity. The Batang slices does not disappoint. I would say it has a hidden gem status. Not worth travelling super long for, but if you're anywhere within a 5km radius and is dying for some fish soup and willing to splurge, I'll put my bet on this place. Might come back to try the fried one next time but with the Batang slices so good, I imagine it hard to wilfully eat any other thing kn the menu whenever I'm there."
"fish a lot but quality went down, fish not as fresh as before."
"I was in the Woodlands and tried to search for decent fish soup and and Jing Fish Soup was the only option I found online. Arriving on a Saturday late afternoon, there was only one person ahead of me. The coffee shop itself was clean and spacious, a welcome sight.

While I usually prefer clear fish soup, the pictures of their Tom Yum Soup looked enticing, so I decided to give it a try. I ordered Tom Yom Yee Mian and added bitter gourd, bringing the total to $8.50.

First impressions were good. The fish portion was decent, and the free flow of crispy shallot oil condiment was a delightful touch. However, the Tom Yum soup itself was a bit of a letdown. Instead of the usual sour and spicy flavours, it had a surprising sweetness that I wasn't expecting.

Thankfully, the fish slices were perfectly cooked and lightly marinated, just the way I like them. Tender and flavourful, they were the star of the dish.

Update: came back to try the clear soup and it taste way better than Tom Yum."
Saw influencer raving this on TikTok and decided to come by and try. Picture doesn't do justice to the taste. The soup was good and milky. But I still feel something was missing so didn't give the 5 stars. Overall is recommended and worth coming here. Ample parking space at the MSCP beside the coffeeshop.
"I don't usually write reviews for food in Singapore but wow this is really one of the best find in Woodlands! Soup was rich and super tasty, probably one of the best fish soups I've ever had. Will definitely come back!"
One of the hidden gem in woodlands for fish porridge. The batang fish is simply mouth watering good ! Recommended !
Had fish head soup for lunch. So good!!
"Usually I don't write reviews for places in SG but wow this is one of the shocking find in woodlands. The portion is huge, and the soup is extremely tasty. I cannot find another place that offer this much fish meat for $7.50. Really really worth it."
Fish soup was pleasantly nice. Batang fish was fresh and serving was generous. Lots of tofu and veggies as well. Quite a surprise find.
Take away double fish soup with fish egg. $8.70 never put in the fish egg!!!
Relatively affordable at $5.5 for fish soup with rice/vermicelli. Decent portion of fish slices. Fresh and delicious.
"One of the best Chinese rojak I've ever had. Nestled in the Roxy square coffeeshop, this is a must try if you're living or working in the Katong area. Auntie is so friendly and you can also pay via PayNow. Reasonably priced. I always got for the Taupok and Youtiao combo with an addition of century egg. Sauce is savoury as well."
In my opinion the best rojak. Grew up having her rojak at her previous store in Macpherson area. So happy that we found her again.
"While flavour was not robust and full of depth, it was a very clean tasting plate of rojak."
"The sauce is very nice.  Comes with taupok, Yu char kway, turnip, cucumber, pineapple.  Can top up century egg and base ingredients.

Served by a polite and fast lady."
One of the better rojak i have had. You tiao and tau pok are grilled crispy. Rojak comes w slice of apple and lime bit. A refreshing touch ! 
"It's one of the better rojak stalls. Have been eating her rojak when the stall was in a coffeeshop in the MacPherson area. Not the best, but certainly on my top 5 list."
"Rojak is a salad composed of sliced fruit and vegetables served with a spicy palm sugar dressing and lots of peanuts, so stay away if you have a peanut allergy. The price is great. The auntie making the Rojak is super nice and efficient: the Rojak was great and went well with the laksa I had from neighboring stall. I for a small and thought the portion was quite generous/ we also got a watermelon fruit cup for 1.50. I would recommend this dish if you like spicy peanut salad."
Made me wait 30 minutes for a small takeaway order on an uncrowded Wed night at 8pm. Shudder to think what peak periods will be like. Didn't warn me the wait would be that long. Did warn a couple after me though!
My favourite mala stall.  The food is really good value for the price
"great food had the mala, order Zhong la did not disappoint!!"
asked for Wei La and Shao You and I really got both! okay with it since i was looking for something lighter. have to agree there's no mala taste though. $5 for 5 ingredients
"I read many comments stating that the mala is not spicy, doesn't have any mala taste. I am an avid mala fan so I went to try out of curiosity without any expectations.

The mala xiang guo is not your typical mala xiang guo BUT it is delicious. Not all mala tastes the same (think Gong Yuan Mala Tang and YGF). I would liken this to the healthier version as it is not overly oily and salty which i really like. I ordered medium spicy and it is less spicy than the typical medium spicy so you may want to go highest level if spicy is your thing. I finished up everything and you can see there's not a layer of oil on the soup base. This is great for me as I'm on a low carb diet but still want to enjoy mala.

Price wise, it was shockingly good. This is the best value for money mala xiang guo I've ever had. I ordered 3 types of green leafy veg, asparagus, 3 types of mushrooms, black fungus, dory fish, quail eggs and it was only $12. Mind you, the lady boss was not stingy when she grabbed the ingredients for me. This is the only time I felt a mala stall owner is doing an honest business without ripping the customer off. My usual order would come up to at least $18 to over $20 typically.

The stall also sells handmade frozen dumplings (30 pcs for $30) so I ordered the XLB to try (if it's good I'll come back to get the frozen dumplings). The XLB is generous in size. Skin is rather thick (I'd prefer thinner skin) but it's chewy - very much like the handmade dumplings my friend from China makes - very authentic. The soup within is lightly flavorful and tasty. Again not too overpowering kind of taste nor salty. I have to say the meat is very fine and soft. $5 for a basket I think is good value.

If you are looking for the typical oily, salty mala xiang guo then don't come here.

I have saved this stall to return again!"
The spicy food advertised isn't spicy at all. Food is overpriced as well and the owner often pretend not to see customers while she was idling doing nothing.
Food does not taste good.
"Ma La Xiang Guo Hen Hao Chi,Neng Chi La De Chang Shi Yi Xia Zhong La. Kao Yu Hen Shi Hui,Chao Shou Te Bie Hao Chi"
My go to. Most authentic I've had. Others saying it don't taste like mala cause they used to the fake SG version...
"Cheap. Lady boss will grab the items for you instead, so it doesnt go by weight but goes by portion instead. Seafood and Meat are the same price at $2/portion, veg at $1/portion and +$0.50 for takeaway. Though no strong mala taste but i enjoy their mala tang."
the first MALA I ate that have zero MALA flavour. Mei You Ma La Wei. extremely cheap but no flavour at all. feels like you fry mix all the ingredients and just fry with chicken powder.
"Coffee shop mala. Cheap, but not mala flavor."
"Reasonably priced.

My mala pot for 2 persons portion costs only $11 (with noodles). I ordered Xiao La and it's spicy enough for me.

Xiao long bao was superb. Not small at all. They are big and juicy and the soup inside the bao was tasty and flavourful (not salty).

Fried dumplings Guo Tie cost $5 for 12 pieces  which is so much cheaper than the coffeeshop that I usually frequent."
Has its special taste of noodle. Like always got more vege. Favorite is of coz still the chilli sauce. Taste nicer at shop always. Tried order delivery. Chilli always not give enough.
"They seem to be continuously tweaking their recipe, hits the spot if you like the dry kind. Plain noodles are tasty."
"Tried this at a friend's place who ordered takeaway. I was excited initially but ended up disappointed. The thick noodles stuck together to form one soggy mess. While there were plenty of ingredients, they lacked flavor. The much-raved chili was spicy but didn't enhance the bland noodles."
"Ordered their recommended curry rice set based on their menu
Oh my. Self declared recommendations should be avoid at all costs.
Curry taste definitely from instant curry paste. Salty as well.
Will NEVER patronise this store again"

Noodle nice taste ;environment good
Their special chili is very spicy and is a traditional delicacy that Singaporeans like very much. It is worth recommending everyone to eat it
"Our favourite wonton mee. Two reasons:

1. Super crazy delicious chili sauce that nowhere else has
2. Perfectly fried wontons which I haven't found anywhere else

Noodles and boiled wontons are good. Charsiew not the best but not what we come here for. Quantity of wontons are actually very good for it's price point. Plus no queue."
"Hand made noodle taste nice.. The chilli is really spicy.. add on your own level of spiciness.

The vegetable still quite decent compared to many other stores.  The wanton can be bigger.. Char siew quite normal..

Try some before taking their free pork lard..  I like pork lard.. But their for me and my friend find it oily even it's dried. You can taste oil.. not the fragrant of the pork lard.. Also not so crispy at all..

The soup is surprisingly nice..

For the price of $5.50 for a regular size of noodle still can improve on some of the ingredients..

The store is quite spacious on the table arrangement..

They still have curry chicken and other  fried prawn fritters.. will try out next time..

We went before 5pm.. so not much crowd inside..

One more thing.. we supposed to look for Eng Wanton Mee... from the Google map.. But Google maps brought us here.. but later understanding from them that they change the name to Rong's Wanton Mee.."
"Wanton mee ($6.50 for large) - The wantons (4 pieces) and char siew were not bad. The noodles and chilli sauce were good.

From an earlier visits
Wanton mee (large) - The noodles were particularly nice. The wantons, chilli sauce, and char siew were good too."
"Food was so so, but attitude of the middle aged chubby guy at the counter was terrible and completely ruined our meal. Guy acted like we owed him money the entire time. Whatever issue he may be facing at the time, it wouldn't be right to take it out on customers right?"
Super lousy customer service and super bad attitude. Totally spoil the day and not worth any visit. Not recommended
"Name changed but food is still great. Am a loyal customer!! People here are friendly too, always happy when i come here. They'll even help me carry the food to my car when I buy too much and its too heavy for me."
"The food is nice, except the cashier looks like you owe him a billion dollar"
"Rong Wanton Noodle really hits the spot when I'm craving a good bowl of wanton mee. The noodles are super springy and tossed in a tasty sauce that's not too oily. Char siew is tender with just the right amount of char,  so satisfying. The wantons? Juicy and packed with flavor!

Chili lovers will love the kick in the spicy version, but it's also great without. Fast service, good portions, and super comforting, definitely one of my go-to spots for a solid bowl of noodles."
Power chilli and Gu Zao Wei De Mian 
"Tried the curry chicken and it was a huge disappointment. The curry was incredibly diluted, lacking both depth and spice. Instead of a thick, flavorful sauce, it felt more like a bland soup with barely any seasoning. DO NOT EVEN THINK OF TRYING THE CURRY CHICKEN! This is the WORST CURRY CHICKEN I ever tried!"
Does this look like wanton noodles or char siew noodles? I can't find any wanton at all... 
"Started eating the franchise version which was really meh and saw this one and decided to try and wow it is so much better than the franchise versions out there.

The light taste needs a careful blend of nuanced balancing and with the power chilli. Enjoyed the wanton noodles a lot. Will be back for sure whenever I'm in the area."
The best Wanton Noodles along Tg Katong Road! Spicy chilli! Yummy!
Still as amazing as ever. But i feel the chilli sauce lost its punch. The portion size was really generous tho! Recommend to get the large!
I left my Samsung Galaxy Z Fold behind after lunch yesterday and was incredibly fortunate that the honest staff returned it to me many hours later. Thank you so much! Your act of kindness really restore faith in people :)
"Was nearby so decided to give it a try.

I knew this isn't the original which has moved to Joo Chiat if I'm not wrong.

Ordered 2 large dry noodles and a wanton soup.

Noodles:
thick and poor texture

Char Siew:
Standard

Soup:
hint of chicken broth and very bland

Wanton:
out of a box and thick skin texture with tasteless filling.

Chilli:
Too sweet but very spicy.

The chilli and other condiments were packed separately.

In summary the food is so bland all you will taste is the sweetness of the Chilli with your noodles.

I'm not sure where they get their supplies from, but it appears to be for convenience rather than anything else.

First and last time. All the best."
Loved the noodles. A touch oily and salty but it was a wonderful bowl. Chilli and free flow ba you were fire  .

Pricey but the wanton noodles are quality stuff
Delicious wanton mee. Recommended.
"I prefer this WM after tasting the other original one opp this shop , lady boss WM standard drop alot ."
Name has changed but the food's the same. Loved the fat wanton and thick noodle (compared to other wanton noodle stalls) and of course the fiery chilli sauce. Ordered the prawn fritter too but it was oily and the prawn didn't look fresh (it was actually dark and couldn't tell it's a prawn). Will return for the wanton noodle and chilli.
"Not sure if it's cos of the dispute/lawsuit, the food quality has dropped. The wonton skins are super thick and the fillings are not half as good as what you find anywhere else"
Very oily and overrated wanton noodles.
I opt out for the char siew and replaced it to fried wanton if you are not a char siew person. A very satiety meal for the Kickstart of my day. All great and delicious
"$40+ for 4 people to eat wanton mee with 2 sides to share, edible but really overpriced

The handmade ngoh hiang was tiny, falling apart and visibly burnt
Yup, that's the full portion in the picture. I almost laughed when the waiter brought it out"
"3 star after meal
drop to 1 star 3 hours later

The curry is worth a try, ONCE

Apparently the wanton noodle is nice

Ngo hiang. is worth a try, ONCE

After 3 hours you are still drinking down water to get rid of the after effects (msg?)"
"a very spacious sitting area
one of the good wanton mee noodles i have tried. Their style not the typical chilli already add in for u. If u want some spicy can top up yrself at the table top.
Noodles bouncy chewy very nice texture among the wanton mee i have tried.
Soup is A+ the scallop soup a must try it come with the noodles.
i order side dish their fried wanton super delicious meat is generous. The one at parklane is disappointing their name has zha yun tun mee but their fried wanton no much filling. i recommend people who love wanton mee gives this stall a try is worth.
Their pork lard is free flow.
Char siew was nice bitting and taste good."
"Wanton noodles is springy, tasty and with reasonable size wantons. The ngoh hiang items are also fresh!"
"I didn't manage to take photos on food, but the food standard has deteriorated.

The Wu Xiang Ngohiang roll is not as good as the past."
"The best wanton noodle in sg! 
Noodles QQ just the way I like it.
Chili is spicy enough to add flavour.
Soup is quite tasty.
Ice Bali top tier. "
"I've been eating Eng's noodles since my childhood, so it's obvious I'll be biased. The noodles are simply good. To some, it's an acquired taste. To me, it's comfort food. I must have it once in a while :)

11 Aug 2024 Update:
It's been a few of years since I visited the main branch in Tanjong Katong. I'm glad to report that they have more or less maintained the standard of the noodles. However, the wanton skin is a bit thicker and harder than I remember ..."
"decent meal but not a fan - oily noodles, tough charsiew and hard wantan. did not live up to the high ratings and expectations."
"Sadly, the standards have dropped. The wantons tasted strange, the char siew looked like it was kept and reheated , dry and hard. The chilli was also different. Noodles hard and clumped together. Only the lard was fresh and good."
Wanton mee not as good as it says
"An institution. This is the original Eng's store which my family used to patronise near-weekly years ago for eggy wanton mee. Now is still as good, though the chilli spice level seems to have toned down (but still power spicy, esp if you add a lot). Free flow pork lard = steady bom pi pi

Love the fried wantons as usual. The wanton soup not so much, a bit of a weird aftertaste to the meat in the wantons."
One of the BEST WANTON Noodles in Singapore
"Rong's Wantan Noodle has an interesting backstory involving disputes over ownership. The original Eng's Wantan Noodle business, started by Ng Ba Eng, faced a split among his children and business partners after his passing. This led to the formation of competing brands: Eng's Wantan Noodle and Eng's Char Siew Wantan Mee, resulting in various disputes.
As for the dining experience, the noodles at Rong's Wantan Noodle are decent but not exceptional. It's still a satisfying wanton mee with generous free flow of crunchy pork lard bits, and tangy pickled green chillies, not to mention the legendary fiery hot sauce. While the quality is passable, it's not compelling enough to justify a special trip, especially given its somewhat out-of-the-way location. The dishes might suffice for a quick meal if you're already in the area, but there are likely better options available for a similar price."
12Jul24 still good!
Casual cheap lunch spot. Generous portion. Wanton noodle is thick and chewy and comes with lean char siu and greens.
"No longer what it used to be (at Tanjong Katong Road).

We used to be a regular at the 287 Tanjong Katong Road outlet.
After the public ""split"" in 2018, I found the 248 Tanjong Katong shop to be nicer (noodles have a bit of soy sauce on it, which uplifts an otherwise texture-dry bowl). Henceforth, I exclusively ate at 248 Tanjong Katong until their lease expired.

Followed their Facebook closely and was happy they reopened at Joo Chiat after around 8-9months. Visited them on their first week of opening at 8pm and found their noodles to have a VERY STRONG alkaline taste.

I actually went to feedback to the Lady Boss - she explained that the water used to boil the noodles was not changed as it was nearing their closing time and it will take very long to re-boil the water (Red Flag 1: I've eaten at 248 Tanjong Katong 5mins to closing time and have NEVER experienced this issue).

Went back 3 weeks later at ~11:30am BEFORE the lunch crowd, and experienced the exact same issue - noodles had overpowering alkaline taste. Once again feedback to the Lady Boss and she gave the same explanation (Red Flag 2: rather than committing to improve their quality control, Lady Boss was busy giving ""explanations""). Seems like regular customer's feedback is no longer important to her.

have not gone back since."
Changed named but food is mainly the same. Chili is still spicy  but now the place is lacking character or feeling of nostalgia.
"Delicious bouncy noodles, accompanied by the tantalising kick of their famous chilli sauce. Wanton and char siew were cooked to mouthwatering perfection and the soup was reminiscent of home. You know that scene in Ratatouille where Anton Ego is sent straight to his childhood from his first bite and proceeds to risk his career for a rat? This is one of those dishes -- not just a meal but a nostalgic experience. Compliments to the sensational staff as always."
Good great wonderful.
"Best Wantan Noodles.

Used to be called Engs Noodles, but now renamed to Rong's Wanton Noodles."
"Changed name (and owner?), still tastes the same as of April 2024"
"Not sure about the change of name from Eng to Rong, but more importantly is the quality of the wtm. The noodles are still the same lightly tossed with oil and soy sauce unlike others that usually drowned in all kinds of sauces. The noodles are good even if you don't add the signature spicy chilli. Char siew is also right not overly charred or sweet. The small portion comes with boiled wanton only and the meat is well marinated not overly saltish. Though the price has increased, overall it's still good."
"The food was awesome.
Must try !"
Very nice wanton noodle at reasonable prices ($4.50/$5.50). The fried wanton is very crispy. The chill is really spicy so don't add too much. Love the crispy pork lard which you can help yourself to at a side table. The wanton that came with the noodle might be too salty though. 2024 update: prices of the noodles increase by $1. Tried the dry version this time but not tasty and is too dry. The soup version should be nicer.
"Still one of Singapore's best Wan Tan Noodles..

The noodle is very nice..almost Al dente. Not the soggy variety. Not the black sauce type. This is truly the original Wan Tan Noodles.. Tossed in a light mixture of soy sauce and oil.

Soup is also very good.
Gotta try..

Update. Takeaway today.
No price increase for CNY. Still good."
Food taste is consistent. Food served is quite fast. Cheap and good! Chili was really spicy so becareful for chili lovers.  Got the usual big wanton noodles dry and fried wanton with mayonaise! Loved it
"I'm not a fan of thicker mee kia type of yellow noodles for wanton mee but this here is springy, not clumpy, and does not have alkaline taste. Very nice. Ingredients are generous too. Love the convenient individually packed green chilli, crispy pork lard and spicy power chilli sauce. Love the broth and generous serving size. We added prawn fritters, ngoh hiang and century eggs on the side. All shiok."
Taste pretty average for the pricing. Better off to a wanton mee store from a random coffee shop.
The noodles were perfect! Char siew good. Wan ton very good. Fried Wan ton also super.
"I have been a fan of Eng's wanton mee for more than a decade. Even with the business rivalries taking place at Tj Katong Rd, I continued to support both stalls as they tasted pretty similar and were good.

Unfortunately, my visit yesterday at the newly opened outlet (Joo Chiat) was a huge disappointment.  At the very first bite, I felt the difference in the noodle texture.  The charsiew wasn't tasty and the wantons were hard and tasteless.  The soup tasted different too :(

Service was also very slow.  I won't be coming back anytime soon until they have decided to bring back the old original taste."
"It's always nice as usual, especially the chilli. The S portion is just nice for ladies or elderly or small eater, and L size is filling. Only for this outlet, abit hard to get phone signal if you seated abit deeper from the entrance. Also they only receive cash payment"
The noodles are little dry and oily but overall it's springy and tasty enough. Wantons and charsiews are so so though. Definitely overpriced!
"One of the few places in Singapore where you can eat and leave, without having to tray return.  The food is delicious and comparatively cheap.  $5.50 for small and $6.50 for big bowl of wanton noodles.  The person serving food to your table is so courteous and kept 'thanking' you for patronage.  This is what consumers are looking for.

I couldn't finish my lime juice and employee is so nice to help you 'dabao' without charging extra, most importantly, with a smiling face.  Where to get from hawker centre and food court.  The heart to serve is totally different.  Thumps up."
"Don't be deceived by the plain looking noodles.

It's flavorful and al dente. The chili packs a power punch as well."
"Pu Tong Shi Wu,Bing Wu Te Bie"
Normal wanton mee. Only selling point is their spicy chilli.... Eat if you are around the area and running out of choice
"Wanton noodle is great! The Al dente noodle and chilli sauce are good combinations.

Special commendations to the stall manager/owner in black tee. I left my phone and he went extra miles to find me in car park behind! Thanks to him, he made my day!
Xie Xie "
"Was in the vicinity and decide to drop on to eat during off-peak hour since I have not eaten it for a while.

Well, the noodles are still QQ and they actually give green vegetables (to balance the meal). Pretty expensive for $5.50 (small bowl). I actually can better value and tastier ones at CapitaSpring food court.

Not sure if the standard has dropped or I've outgrown Eng's wanton mee. I don't think I will make the effort to travel for this ...."
"Hubby and son loves this wanton noodles, but I prefer the Jalan Tuan Kong mee pok type. So I usually tarpow for them. Surprisingly quiet on a weekday at 7pm. The fried wontons are good. Chilli is very very spicy. Service is fast but place is not air conditioned."
"Quite special wanton mee, noodle texture unlike other place. Original Taste is good. Their Best part is the pork lard , they put it on the condiment table, so u can take it urself. For us it's like free flow, it's the best! Coz we really love it! Don't try their super hot chilli easily, it's not really nice as a chilli sauce, it's only give u the hot feeling, but not much on taste. Their fried item is nice too, the sauce for fried food is super good as well!"
"A Flavorful Experience at 287 Tanjong Katong Eng's Wanton Noodle

The noodle at 287 Tanjong Katong Eng's Wanton Noodle was an absolute delight! The savory flavors, combined with the perfect hint of spice from the chili, made for a memorable dining experience. The noodles were cooked to perfection, and the chili elevated the taste to a whole new level. A must-try for any noodle enthusiast!"
"Food is good, standard taste with the spicy chilli sauce.
Not much service to talk about as it's self ordering. Not fantastic nor bad
Atmosphere is set for diners to quickly have their fill and go off."
Over price along this area.
"Pretty impressed with the food here.
The wanton noodles is not the usual Hong Kong noodle variety. Meaning it's not thin and stringy. The noodle is thick and springy instead.
Sauce is also different from the usual combinations. It's more sweet based but not due to soy sauce.

Noodles alone is worth coming for.

The fried wanton and oyster sauce vegetables are good as well. Complements the meal.

All that costs about $12 per person.

Will be back."
Burning trash on the sidewalk today creating unsafe conditions for passersby
ok only la
"I absolutely love the springy wantan noodles this place serves and the super spicy chilli sauce. Noodles have a nice QQ feel to them. I also really like the lime juice!

The char siew and wanton are decent but nothing memorable. Used to taste better years ago, but hey, I still like it for the noodles and sauce so I'm happy to come back!

Side note: This place has poor cell phone coverage."
"It was sooo good!! The oil and seasoning was so fragrant, the wantan was very tasty too. Definitely ordering the large bowl next time i'm back!"
I ordered yesterday afternoon for delivery today at lunch (11:30-12noon) my order was cancelled by Eng's at 11:53am. My family was waiting to eat lunch and now we are scrambling to buy lunch for everyone. Totally unacceptable by Eng's to do this. Is this the way they run their business? Will avoid patronizing them from now on and will share with family and friends on this bad experience. We await Eng's offer of compensation.
"The texture of the char siew noodle is chewy. Skipping onto the main ones would be the bee hgioh. The chilli, ginger with the bee ngioh is just so much better than the mains."
"Only the noodle saved the day . Ordered also the Pork Sau sage , prawn fritter chestnut pancake and the century egg - IMO , we only tasted  flour , not much of the flavours except the century egg. Will not come again."
Great wanton mee!! Comfort food! Chilli is powerfully awesome!!
"It has been a while since I last visited here. It was a Sunday night at about 8pm, and not a customer in sight. I ordered a large portion of wanton noodle at $6.50, and I finally realised why? The food was lukewarm, ingredients pathetic and service non existent, as I was told to get my own chopstick and spoon from the side station myself. Banking on the good reputation from old can only get you so far, without food quality control and value for money. The whole dining experience was a far cry from their good old days of fame. RIP"
Generous portion. Tasty noodles. Nice presentation. Plenty of carparks at the back of the shop.
"It doesn't have the most impressive char siew, or the most succulent wantan but the noodles, the springy noodles that's served al dente is probably the best out there. Add in the bit of their signature chilli sauce and you have WTM that has its place among the highest echelon of WTMs..."
"Good, but I've had better chiasu pork. The chilli is potent and very nice. I also like that they use less oil."
I find the wanton noodles are good!
"Wei Dao Bu Cuo Ya,Chi Ji Nian Liao,Ta Jia Hen Duo Fen Dian,Dan Shi Gan Jue Zhe Li Zui Hao Chi"
Dry Wantan Noodle was a little too salty but otherwise not bad a place for wantan noodles!
"After trying out the Dunman wanton mee at Dunman food center, Eunos and their competitor opposite them, I finally get to try this store and sadly I rank this place the last of the Dunman wanton mee stores, everything is outclassed except for the texture of the noodles and char siew."
"Noodles and taste were good, only wish char siew was nicer."
Average taste and saltish.
It is still good wanton mee after 12 yrs of being away. But not the same as I remember it.
One of the best wanton noodle which preserves the heritage taste. Love their chillie sauce and wanton noodle. I had this noodle since I was young until now already 30yrs
Even take out also taste nice
"All on points, except the char siew...
Chili powerful but no longer the hottest in the market. Noodle cooked perfectly, springy as it should be. Wanton not bad.
Love thier self service vibe... Even on fried pork lard... Yummy!"
I love the springy noodles and the fried wantons. The char siew is acceptable but not great which is why I've given it 4 instead of 5 stars. Definitely something I would eat if I'm craving wanton mee.
"Noodle too hard, pork lard not fresh, fried wantan too salty, chili not right.... Where did the real eng wanton noodle go?"
"The wonton is delicious and so is the noodles, but feel a little sticky or too dry for some."
The noodles are a bit sticky but the soup was amazing. The fried Wanton was also really good and I recommend it to other people.
"It is no longer the same.
The soup is flat with hints of soya sauce.
Noodles is nondescript.
Sorry we used to like it but after this not coming back.
I expect toilets should be clean n dry."
Better than the opposite one.
"Salty wanton, skin is thick, noodles feels heavy.
Char siew good.
Soup tastes weird, hint of herbal?

Generally poor"
"Local delights :)
Good to dine in on off-peak periods"
"I decided to head over to try out the famous wantan noodles with my wife, who likes her wantan noodles. The noodles are not exactly the traditional wantan noodles that I prefer, i.e., thinner and more QQ version. Here, the noodles are thicker and feel more like yellow noodles. I like the spicy chilli sauce that they offer, which adds a kick to the noodles. We also ordered some fried stuff, which is pretty decent and goes well with the noodles."
Just walk past this shop to eat the chicken rice at the corner. Will try someday when in this area.
"Very bad experience at the ARC branch, the 3 staff are very rude. We lunch at 12.55 pm on 1/2/2023.would award 0 star if possible."
Noodles are quite plain and the char siew very sweet.
Bad service. Avoid this place
"At first I was like why this Wantan Mee no Wantan then I mixed the noodles and the Wantan was at the bottom.

This was a very good bowl of noodles and the chilli was actually spicy and damn shiok. $6 for the large bowl (pictured below) but it's fairly filling.

10/10"
"The noodles are so-so. Wanton isnt nice. Char Siew was just normal. But the chilli is really spicy + free flow pork lard. But thats the only selling point this place has for me.
Will rather try other food or wanton mee at a cheaper price since the BIG bowl ($6) is just nice for me only."
"Totally screw up! Ordered physically & they missed out food order despite asking many times... totally screw up experience. I can't be counting my mass order!! Worse part, the number reflected can't call through ... this is by far the worse experience with Eng!"
"This is a coffee shop that sell   style wantan mee . I don't really like it and never will, but all Singaporean loves it. The wierdest part is, you can add tomato sauce in it. I still prefer the original hong kong Cantonese style wanton  . But this place seems quite popular among the locals. You can try and see for yourself .
 eating  "
"Chili not so spicy as previously.
Noodle still acceptable."
The food standard seems to have dropped over the years. Tried twice already and don't think it's worth the time and money no more.
"Stale chili, bad service, the chain killed the golden goose"
Very nice noodles!
normal. dun bother going all the way here
"2 Eng's across the road from each other, unrelated to each other. Your pick of preference:)"
Simple great tasting comfort food. Beware of the chilli. It is spicy! Very convenient parking at the back.
just posting to remind myself not to patronise this lousy and greedy imposter..
"We patronized one of our favorite wanton noodles place this afternoon - after a pretty long while. Found out that their signboard had been changed slightly to ""Eng's Wanton Noodles"" instead of ""Eng's Char Siew Wanton Noodles"".

Ordered our usual, but when I got my water chestnut drink, it was so diluted! I voiced out to the waiting staff when he delivered our wanton noodles. He was very gracious, ""I will change it."" And he promptly brought back a ""more normal"" glass of water chestnut drink.

Realized that the prices of wanton noodles had gone up a little. The small portion was currently $5, while the bigger bowl was $6 - gone up about 10 percent? Anyway, costs had all gone up, it's understandable.
Wifey liked their noodles. By the way, the Chilli Paste wasn't super hot as in the past, but spicy enough for us. Must say ""palatable"". Hahaha.

We found the standard of wanton had dropped - in texture and taste. One of the wanton even ""burst"".

We tried their Ngoh Hiang today - ordered 3 types. The pork sausage, prawn fritter and liver roll. Generally quite good, but again probably because we had not eaten ngor hiang for quite some time.

However, in the prawn fritter, there were only 3 tiny prawns. Quite miserable really. The fritter would taste much better if they doubled the number of prawns. Yes, maybe with a little increase in price.

The liver roll was nice but we found it a little soft, probably because of too much flour.

All in all, the meal was good and not too expensive."
"Tried the famous wanton noodle. It is nice but the noodle was a bit too oily. Apparently there is another shop doing better, which is just in front."
"Standard dropped. The noodles are just mushy. Not Q. And it's not just this outlet, all the other green plate outlets as well."
"Surprised to see no queue at 7.30pm on a Tuesday evening. Only 1 table was occupied.

The food was still fantastic so was puzzled why there was lack of customers.

Pro tip, the difference between a small bowl and big bowl is only $1. So just topup the $1 and get the big bowl instead of small."
"Standard dropped, portion seemed smaller. The crispy pork lard is rancid!"
Not bad wanton mee for it's pricing
Great little restaurant. Fast and simple. Not an exhaustive menu which I enjoyed. Their signature wantan with pork with noodles was soooo tasty and cheap. I went back for seconds. Paired with their spicy sauce as it was amazing. Definitely recommend.
The waton are so so salty. Can't finish it had to throw it away! Regretted.
Seems the quality of the food has dropped. A bit disappointing...
Cheap and delicious
"Comparing this wanton noodle to the one opposite (with almost the same name), I still prefer the noodle from this shop - maybe because I was ""brought up"" with this style/taste as compared to the one opposite the road (yes, I've tried both). The noodle is more ""QQ"" and the soup is tastier. Now, they even offer ngoh hiang (pork sausages, prawn fritters, crackers, fishcakes, etc.)! More varieties than it used to be - just wonton noodles and fried wontons. Maybe it's a good thing when there's a direct competition just opposite the road! The reason why only 3 stars from me because.... The taste... Somehow is not the same as before... The ""QQ"" of the noodle is not as before, more hard now than the ""bouncy"" feel before... and the soup is not as ""brothy"" as before. Maybe I'm older now so the taste bug has deteriorated :) Still, worth the trip and now, they have many more branches for your convenience!... Update (15 Jul 2022)... Totally disappointed as the taste of the noodle is not as before and somehow, it's saltier. What happened?! Change of chef or reduced in ingredients quality because of inflation? I know there could be many reasons for the drop in standard of taste (though it is very personal to me), I'll think twice if I want to come back.... Parking is fairly convenient at the back..."
"$5.50 for one small bowl of Wanton Mee is just too expensive and it's not filling for lunch. The noodles texture isn't right. It's not Q. Last but not least, if they want to raise the price, jolly well provide more noodles to justify it. Else it doesn't make sense to me. There are plenty of alternatives for $5.50."
"Not the real one. Go to the opposite, so much better in taste and service. You can clearly see which one has better average review score"
"Beside Wantan Noodle, it also sells things like ngor hiang and the like. Unlike the ENG's on the opposite side. Beware, the ngor hiang and things are not cheap."
"Update: Had dinner at Eng's just now. Not worth the visit... period.

---

Frankly, I'm not quite sure why the fuss over Eng's. My wife and daughter love it though. The chilli served is supposed to be good, but it's lost some of its fervour after the founder passed on. The food is slightly above average at best. There're definitely other places that serve better wanton noodles in Singapore."
Not sure why but we found the branch at Great World City is much better (Noodle is hard like not well cook here).
Noodles and wantan is very salty   
Always good maintain after all these years
The food is quite ordinary. The shop has a hawker centre or coffeeshop feel but more expensive.
They serve tasty noodles... the fried wonton was ok for me..
Went there in a weekday. Quiet and fast service. Food quality is good.
Excellent noodles.
Noodles was good. Their Ngo Hiang also not bad
"Gd food, horrible service, the female cashier....so unfortunate to hire someone like her."
"Best wanton noodles! Delicious and full of flavor. Despite the long queue, the shop is run efficiently and turnover of tables are fast. The place is clean, and furnished with an old-Singapore flair"
Noodle is not good at all. Wonton are oke
"very nice food here,  LOVE the pork lard. but twice out of the three times i visited, it wasnt open"
"Always a good meal here. The chili with the ""beware spicy"" is really   but worth it.

100% recommended if you're around the area. Never tried the branches always visit the main outlet at Katong."
Waited 40minutes for 10 number of queue and very bad service from the service staff
"Over hyped. No big deal, just only spicy chilli mix. I have eaten so many wanton noodle. Will grade this as local wanton noodle, just very normal. Tried and wouldn't try again. There are many many much nicer wanton noodle around."
"I believe this used to be one of my favourite Wanton Noodle store. Must try, especially the chilli paste."
"4 stars - Very good, definitely worth a visit if you like this kind of food.

Visited the Katong area hoping to eat at Little Italy, but they were closed and so we went for a walk. Gave some thought to the two wantan noodle stores just opposite each other, but decided to go with the Original Store based on number of Google reviews (1,400 vs 400). Apparently the original stall is a franchise with the ex-head chef, while the new stall is set up by the founder's children.

Ordered 1 x big wantan noodles, 1 x small wantan noodles, 1 large plate of fried wantans, and a drink. Total damage: $8.50 per person. Fairly reasonable.

Portions were large and generous with the ingredients. Chili (spicy, be warned!) and pork lard on free flow. Noodles were springy and tasty in the sauce, despite looking rather plain.

Char siew was not too dry, and soup wantans were actually pretty smooth and meaty. Fried wantans a little greasy, but still nice.

Soup deserves a special mention: usually overly salty at most wantan noodle stalls, this soup is flavourful without sending your sodium levels through the roof.

Will be back to try the competition (apparently ""runned"" by descendants) and decide which is better.

But honestly, if it's in the same ballpark, both probably serve very good wantan noodles for the price point."
"Lardy, fragrant, old school taste wanton noodles. Perfectly enhanced by spicy chili sauce"
Great authentic wanton mee. Easy to find parking too.
Find this outlet better than the one across the road. Try it and see who has similar taste bud.
"fast  and food service.  u can  use
shopback apps TO get your 1st Time 1 for 1 deal can Belive able"
"Very rude and unwelcoming service staff who were expressing their displeasure about the line and complaining about not being able to have their lunch.

What an unpleasant experience at this outlet!!"
"I really enjoy the food here and just thinking about their spicy hot sauce makes my mouth water. To be clear though, it is quite spicy and people who don't eat spicy food should be careful about how much they try the first time. For veterans, try dipping the pork in the hot sauce. The experience is divine."
Their chilli sauce is the BOMB!! It's super spicy even for someone who takes extra spicy for Mala Xiang Guo.
"Good to try... wanton is so so, noodles is good with their chilli sauce"
"Noodles and char siew was average, thought the wantans were delicious!"
"Nice wanton noodles, the only place I know that gives fried pork lard as a condiment but it's pricey though"
"Best in Town. Panjan noodle and Wants, broth, crispy.. all amazing."
"Giving it a shot after all the rave about it.
Not a fan of wanton mee everywhere but i like the texture on how they prep the noodles!"
"very average wantan mee. noodle was doughy and not springy, char siew was bland, wantan was small and the ngoh hiang was average too. don't think I'll be returning again."
"This is one of my favourite wanton mee stalls, having grown up close by. They use a sesame oil base and go with thicker noodles with a bit of an 'overcooked' vibe. Hence, it may not be to everyone's taste. Their chili is Singapore-famous for really packing a punch, and there's even a disclaimer warning you about it.

They have branches all across Singapore, and can be identified as the 'green bowl' one, with the children of the founders operating the shop opposite with the 'white bowl'. Not going too much into the dispute (you can read more on google) but this is now reportedly owned by Lao Huo Tang.

Do also note that 13 people suffered food poisoning after dining here in May this year so I really hope they have now gotten their act together!"
"Above average wanton mee, price was reasonable!
Love the noodles,
not a fan of the char siew,
They do offer free flow portions of their famous chilli sauce+lard fritters+green chilli"
Average bah
"Good wanton mee, good service... "
"Wan ton mee is generally good, although it's a little bit too oily. Ngoh hiong is so-so~"
Pretty good wanton mee at affordable price. Serving is decent as well!
Best won ton I had.
easy access to car parking behind the shop

The chilli sauce taste better in the original Eng's Wantan mee mend by Eng's son and daughter opposite...
"Went around 6pm on Saturday, no one in sight so service was very prompt haha decent quality but have tasted better ones at other hawker centres. Can pop in if no queue and in the area, but don't travel down just for this bah. Oh we ordered the bigger size bowl but portion feels like normal size only!"
Good local noodle!
Nice food and fried wonton
One of the famous wanton noodle of Singapore located along tanjong katong. Parking here can be challenging during weekdays peak hours. Free parking along this road allow on weekends and public holidays
Great local foods
Delicious and hearty bowl of claypot rice!
"Hi bad experience at Tiong Bahru Plaza stall. Why so difficult to request spring onion, diff to cut, either don't give or today was told only soup then can take. Pass me plastic to put myself, so bloody lazy. Busy for nothing. Is not free food. Stop complaining no job if this kind of attitude in work. Sad"
"Very happy with the wantons and al dente noodles and chinese rojak, Eng's chilli sauce is spicy with a kick and the rojak sauce is very tasty but I prefer a thicker consistency."
I don't understand how this shop is still open
"Not as good as the original family shop opposite the road. Noodle is too oily with no flavor. Just pure smack of oil.

Recently they were closed by Singapore Food Agency for a couple of weeks because their food gave 68 people gastroenteritis between 14 May and 17 May.

Would try to avoid this stall and visit the original family shop opposite the road from now on."
"Freshness and hygiene issue. Their food caused us Food Poisioning.
Suffered Diarrhoea and fever after consuming.
This was confirmed after news of scores of people complained of Food poisoning too."
"This shop used to be worse than the daughters shop opposite but when I went today it was better. Their chili isn't as good as the daughters shop opposite of it, it's mainly spicy without much fragrance unlike the daugthers engs wanton. This shop is also pretty inconsistent as the seasoning of the noodles were very different when I bought take away, it was quite bland compared to eating in thus the 3 stars. If it were more consistent and improved their chili it would've been 5 stars no questions asked"
Worst wan ton Mee ever. Not sure why people even bother to queue or how they open so many outlets.
"This hot sauce is so good! And it helps that everything on their menu is cooked and flavored to perfection. I can never get enough veggies and I can't resist the fried wanton, although I limit myself to just one each visit. Can't miss with this food "
"Went close to closing hours, i would say the wanton noodles are decent and would consider them comfort food however, i feel the standards are alittle on and off..

They do sell Wu Xiang along side wanton noodles and the usual fried wantons"
I like the noodle. Recommended!
"wanton mee not really nice,
but staff was good. my mask was spoiled,They provide me new mask."
Awesome traditional wanton mee with crispy ngoh hiang.
Nice food  fast service
Order from foodpanda #675 and received the order with soup spilled all over the plastic bag. Food was not properly seal! Please make sure to seal the food for the deliverer next time! Don't make them be the scapegoat from your lazy staff!
Been eating at Engs since 1980 and was always a big fan of their chili. This Engs used to be very accurate before the splits and multiple branches. Their famous chili burn seems to be gone. They even sell Wu Xiang now. And it's just acceptable but not as good as before
Still have quite a number of people come here eat. Not much queue. Easy to get seats
The  is very spicy. Beware of it. Free flow on the pork-lar
"I just went there earlier yesterday noon to have lunch and it is unfortunate that I have to encounter this incident.

The counter staff (long hair, tall slim lady) is very unprofessional throughout the whole service and even when she made an error of giving me the wrong change, she just looked at me with a upset look after I have explained to her the wrong amount.

The food is mediocre and I can easily pin point places with better food and service quality.

This would be my last time visiting this place.

Zero customer service and horrible food standard."
"food taste is average, that isnt matter. the most memorable is, very poorly service, none of them indulged in hospitality, not even a word. not even a word."
BEST wantan mee! Must eat with chilli! Must order fried wantan!
The taste of the wanton brings back my school days memories! Qq noodles super spicy chilli and crunchy wanton. And really tasty char siew. Go easy on the chilli though!
Love how the noodles were thick yet springy. The highlight was their signature chilli (too spicy but very addictive) 
Zhen De Bu Cuo Wu You Suo Zhi Zan
Simple is always best
"TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT

I was a fan of the original stall since schooling days when many of us will queue for at least half an hour at katong for the noodle. The noodle and wanton were go good back then.

Revisited the stall. Everything looks the same but taste world apart. Food was soulless. Noodles were overcooked, wanton skin was thick and char siew too thick.

Did a Google check to only realize that ""Eng wanton noodle"" is  not the original eng noodle house. Felt so cheated. The relatively high rating score on Google review was highly likely due to good ratings in earlier yrs before Eng passed away.

P.s. eng's children opened their own wanton noodle stall just across the road. Tried it and it taste way better."
The quality and taste is deteriorating..... what a waste.... used to be a very good and famous.... unlikely patronising it again....
"Delicious noodles (esp with added chilli) and boiled wanton! My go-to place in the area. Much better than ""the other engs"" across the street."
Soup is tasty. Noodles are springy.
Noodle has a springy texture but it is a bit too sticky from the starch. Maybe the chef should rinse it under cold water after boiling it. The seasoning for the noodles is a bit bland but adding the chilli adds another dimension to it though the flavor is not there yet.  The boiled wontons are delicious and the soup quite tasty. The fried wonton is crunchy but the flavor is ordinary. Overall the Wantan Noodle(dry) is slightly better than most of the wonton noodles that I have tried  but I would not travel far to eat it again.
"Decent wantan noodles with good quality condiments, no BS."
The noodles are not as springy and wanton skin is broken. Noodles is under seasoned.  The only upside is u can help yourself to as much chili as you want compare to the other stall.
Love the QQ noodles.  I ate it without chilli and its still so tasty. Also love the crispy pork lard  will be back again
Service not up to expectations. Sh0p look spartan. Not the same type as in Dunman hawker ctr
4th visit ever since the new
"Noodles texture & taste good.
Ngor Huang very dry & tasteless"
The taste is generally good but theres a better one out there.Still recommended.
"Perhaps the debate will always be whether this one or the one across the road is better. For someone who tried both sides? I dare to say this is better. Good old wanton mee which won't fail you. To be frank there are multiple outlets around the country but this one definitely won't fail you. Simple and delicious!

Oh go easy on the chilli!"
"I prefer the thinner noodle but this was still good, liked the spicy sambal. The portion was reasonable for the price. The fried wanton was nice."
Excellent service from staff who overheard one of us who commented that hot barley should not he served in plastic cup. She gave us another barley in a glass cup. Wanton noodles here are consistently satisfying with own refills of fried lard. A regular haunt for those who lives nearby.
"This is my favourite wanton mee in SG. If this is your first time trying I will caution you that their wanton has a very acquired taste - not sure what they mixed in (I did not like their wanton initially but it grew on me). Love the Q Q Noodles and their signature chilli. This bowl of goodness balances the spicy + salty + oily. My fav wanton mee really. Also first timers beware of their signature chilli! Because the first time I act smart like my noodles red red I spam, and I teared throughout the meal and had sausage lips after."
"Wonton Mee was really tasty as they coat the noodles with pork lard. Fried wonton was one of the best ones I've eaten, very crispy and easy to crunch into. There is also a self serve counter for condiments like fried pork lard (always fresh and crispy) and pickled chilli."
"Other than wonton noodle, prawn roll (hae zor) is pretty decent."
Noodles so so only.Too soft for my liking
"The group has split into 2 entities now. For this shop, taste was maintained and familiar (I ate both this and the one opposite minutes apart for fair comparison). They have many chains spread islandwide. Taste was stronger, noodle was still thick type but slightly softer, wantons were tastier with more fillings, and soup was more savoury. The drinks were more limited. One thing to take note, the chilli sauce is spicier (I eat samyang red comfortably, as a benchmark). If I would choose, I would go for this one and only this original place (not the other outlets as they are not good based on my intels)."
Favourite wanton mee
"The wanton mee here is on the saltier side. Its very flavourful for how much lard and seasoning it has on the noodle BUT  the wanton is inedible. Its way too salty. That was a turn off for me.

Salty noodle is okay.
Salty soup is good
All these with extra salty wanton is not okay"
A very typical spore version of wan tan noodle
Poor customer service. Dish served without utensils. Ordered drinks but wasnt served until we approached them and the staff simply replied we have to collect the drinks ouselves.  Why noodles served but not drinks. How is customer going to know their weird practice. Disappointed.
A very friendly customer service.Fast service for take away.
"Place to go for traditional wanton noodles, noodles quite crunchy and springy. Chilli provided is really hot and spicy."
"One of the best Wanton Mee in Singapore, consistently good. Very tasty and well-priced. Unfortunately always a long queue especially at peak time"
"It's my favourite wanton noodles place, back then it was only 1 outlet here at tanjong katong,but now they have many branches everywhere,and I've tried the Tampines branch one,to me there's still a high quality control across all branches"
Noodles are too thick.
"Surprisingly, even though I stay in the West, I've been coming to this area quite often. I've only tried some places.. so if you have better recommendations please let me know!

We stumbled upon this popular stall and both of us like it. The noodle is eggy while the wanton and soup is flavourful (not the msg kind of flavorful). The chilli wasn't as spicy as the stall claimed it to be, but I still like it. Some may find the noodles to be undercooked, but that's exactly how my wife prefers her noodles to be - a little firmer to the bite.

Some people said that their ""standard has dropped"". I'm not sure, we've only started patronising this place a few months back and it's already good enough for us. If I've to pick on something, it'll probably be the char siew."
Fast service.
Texture of the noodle is good as it is different from the usual thin yellow noodles.  But sauce bit blend and vege over cooked. Small bowl is $4.50.
Better than average. $5.50 for a large bowl.
"nice,  i like it"
"Used to be better. I think there was a change of management, now the food is too salty."
One of the best wanton mee in Singapore
The taste of the noodles are so-so and I think the price might be slightly higher for its quality.
The best wanton noodles
"The food is nice, but the service still lacking"
"All time fav, comfort food once a week"
Hao Hao Chi!
"2 stars because of the chilli. Everything is salty and the noodles.. omg.. its hard and its thick.

This look like noodle with char siew and wantan. Cannot even be call Wantan mee..

Go hawker and have it for 3.50 ba."
"Love it, the noodle taste it's fantastic."
Egg noodle kind of wantan noodle. Fried Ngo Hiang is too oily and the meat not firm. Not the kind of preferred Ngo Hiang.
Wanton mee famous for its chili only. Else flavour is meh and it's the wanton mee that I am used to.
Quality went down.. better to eat at the other outlet across the road
"Love the chilli, spice level not for the faint hearted"
Isn't to my liking.
The fried wonton and the soup is nice
"Decided to satisfy my craving for good wantan noodle and headed to Eng's Wantan Noodle shop at Tanjong Katong. Little did I realised what a disappointment it will be. Order 2 bowls of noodle for my wife and I. Was expecting the usual quick service but was kept waiting longer than usual despite a half empty shop. When the noodle came, we had to get the chilli and cutlery from a shared table. The disappointment started when we tucked into the noodles. The noodle was rubbery and the chilli sauce lacked the kick of spiciness. The taste was nothing to rave about. The standard of the noodle has drop so much that there's nothing special about it anymore. They now have many branches in the Malls but I for one will not be patronising them given the standard of their food now."
"Went 15 Jun 20 evening.
I stood at the door, they pretended not to see me. I entered and they seem very reluctant to serve. One is playing phone and seems very sien whenever got customer come in.
Would eat the Engs opposite instead, the aunty more polite and noodles more chewy and fragrant. Sadly closed on Monday"
Takeaway wantan and got cheated.. wantan was missing. sad.
"After trying all the Wanton stalls in Katong/Joo Chiat, we still find ourselves coming back to this outlet! Every ingredient is just perfect. Noodle is al dente without being too dry. Generous w lard. Char siew and wanton is more premium and flavourful. Fast to get order. "
The authentic wantan !!
The best Wantan Noodle in Sg! I have it at least 2 times a week  Convenient as well with many outlets around Singapore!
"First time trying the Eng's at Great world city outlet.
Very disappointing, qc standard really cmi. I had it before at the westgate outlet and it was still good. If this is a franchise, please review their practices.

Had the soup wanton mee, and The soup tasted like a watered down version of a left over wanton soup.

Noodles were still good but everything else was subpar. Lime juice was also a watered down version.
:( sad lunch today."
"Way over rated, not nice at all."
delicious wanton mee in the East....so yummy we forgot to take nice pics
"Super salty, the salt like free"
"Better than average wantan mee.  3 things unique about this wantan mee:
1) they allow u to add pork lard pieces yourself which enhances the taste of the noodles
2) noodles are thicker but still springy compared to normal wantan noodles
3) chilli sauce (with a super hot caution) tastes great when added to the noodles

Area for improvement is the char siew which is the red artificially coloured meat which just don't taste as good.

17032020"
Best wanton mee in SG! Soy sauce version
"Delicious noodles, fried wantons and vegetables"
Noodle is not too bad but a bit pricey.
"They say chilli is hot, but is ok to me"
Simple and good wanton mee.
Service was fast and food was good
Yummy noodles with Chilli! But portion is too small for $5.50.
"Grew up eating here. So nostalgic and always good.

Also well priced, just sit down and they will serve you."
I word... Excellent
"lady casher who took my order was black face , especially when i wanted to add more fried wan ton . her face was even blacker . not even a word of thanks!"
Nice wanton noodles. But should order less oil cos they very generous with oil
"Nothing fantastic, standard has really dropped. Prefer the wanton noodles across the road"
"Could be better.
This review is not about food, but hygiene.
I've visited this place numerous times, new outlet at Causeway Point.
But today I'm slight disappointed.
The staff preparing food does not wear mask, and the worst thing is that they kept chatting."
"2 yrs ago i reviewed Simei branch has lesser noodles. Even soup is half filled in the bowl... now the katong branch has the same lesser noodles and its very oily...

Looks like they expand their biz and cant maintain their quality or quantity"
"Cheap, quick, delicious, and ever so moreish."
Long wait but it's worth it!
"Sweating it out is part of the experience - the heat from the chilli, the heat from the shop... This is ENG's!"
"I do like it before their another namesake appeared opposite. It's decent and good.
However not very friendly services.
It's a wee bit oily and the lard isn't that crunchy."
"Didn't know wanton mee without chilli or black sauce can be so good too. Noodles was good, no taste of  alkaline water, and Har Cheong Gai was not bad too. Friendly service!"
Standard drop
"I ordered the dry version, and the noodle was too tough and too salty. The char siew meat was also too tough, and they gave me a piece which was half fats. Really not worth the money. I tried the Tiong Bahru branch noodles too and it was similarly disappointing. Will definitely not have any Eng's wanton ever."
Efficient staff and good choices..
The same old yummy wanton mee with their special extra spicy chilli. now serving wuxiang prawn crackers too.
Always consistent quality here. Been a regular for many years
Parking is easy with the public car park behind.
"Horrible experience the 27 Jan 2020, ordered two Wanton noodles and waited waited waited. Asked the owner how long it will take and he kept stalling and over promising to wait for 5-10 min. 20 min later still no food to be seen. There's another 8-10 tables waiting for their food.

When inquired they said: If you don't like to wait then leave.

There's two other stalls opposite the road, taste is the same and service much better. If only they were opened today.

We did listen to this excellent advice and left without food.

Great job Eng's, I applaud you for exceptional customer service "
"Very salty wanton, the noodles sauce taste
Burnt. Poorly ventilated shop"
"My family used to be a huge fan of the noodles back when they were at the old Dunmun road hawker center. Today was the first time I've tried the noodles again after all these years, and the first mouthful brought back waves of nostalgia.

The noodles were springy and retained the same chewy texture that I loved when I was younger. The chilli sauce was delightfully spicy and complemented the noodles very well. My only grouse is that the portion was a little small for the price."
The noodles was salty and Wantan was mushy. Seriously there are tonnes of nice wanton noodles around. Don't bother.
one word to describe this resto: AUTHENTIC! love it!
Great taste. Be careful of the chilli. It's really spicy!
Like the noodles and the parking is plentiful at the open carpark
Had my wantan noodle at Great World City outlet. Noodle texture is not bad. However the most important wanton is below average. Even the fried oil cubes are terrible. A little too salty as well.
"Without question some of the best wonton noodles in Singapore. The clear gravy lightly drizzled on the thin noodles and pooling at the bottom of your bowl is deceptive, packing an incredible flavour profile. I had the crispy wontons to go with the chewy noodles and there is probably no greater a pairing than this in the entire development of Singapore hawker cuisine. Definitely not for the faint of heart, nor those health foodies who treat their bodies as a temple. The free availability of the devilishly inviting bottle of fried lard, and the hellish blaze of their signature chilli are indicators that this meal isn't merely sinful - it's temptation that would bring down half the angels while their buddies on up high sheepishly debate whether to ask for da pau."
Standard dropped.... the taste is totally off... many empty tables at 1230pm....
"Noodle was ok...
But the chilli was a big hit!!! MUST try..."
The fried wanton is very nice
"Hey this place horrible,work no pay,and cant rest for 4 months,pls share this to let more peoples know."
Nice wanton with egg noodle that is quite different
"Their wonton noodle is good but AVOID  eating their ngoh hiang & those fried stuff because the quality is atrociously bad. Ngoh hiang skin is so soggy n the ingredients in it is so gluey, no bite at all. The red color sausage is nothing but starch hardly any meat. The rest that we ordered are equally bad. Eng's here should just concentrate in serving their wonton noodles or be honest enough to serve better quality ngoh hiang fried items."
The noodles are springy but a little too salty with a nice taste. Char siew is so-so
Great taste. The noodle is very bouncy (QQ) and use of flavor is just nice. A little oily at the base but overall good wanton noodle.
"Used to like it before but it's getting worse , the noodle is soft now, even the veg and wanton are overly cooked, all soften down."
Noodle OK. The rest soso
"Added wu xiang to their menu. This place usually takes no longer than 5 min to get your food to table.  But ever since they added the wu xiang,  it has taken more than half hour to get ur food here.  Not worth the wait as there are 3 stalls along tanjong katong. If u see tables with no food on table,  just shows that there is a very long wait.  Just go to another outlet along the street."
Nice good food
The wanton noodles were excellent. I will be coming back for more next time in Singapore.
for a bowl of noodles is worth the price and average taste.Enjoyed my experience in here overall.
"Sorry, not my wantan noodle taste."
Decent wantan noodle.
Superb chilli !!! Thumbs up for the very nice wanton mee.. my favorite of all in SG . Note* only this katong one is very good. Other outlet not exactly the same..
$5.5 for a large bowl of Wantan noodles. Quality is good but you could get similar at $4 to $4.50 a bowl. Think one visits this place because it is ENG's...
"Dry wonton noodle was very good,but the soup noodle was plain bad. Also had fried wonton."
Mian Dan Xing Huan Ke Yi Yun Tun Rou Tai Nan Liao'. Wu Xiang Fang Tai Jiu *Tai Jiu Liao Nan Chi Jie Qian Gui Yi Dian
Noodles were springy and love the super spicy chill sauce
"Tried both ENG's Wantan Noodle (EWN, this stall serving with green bowls) and ENG's Char Siew Wantan Noodle (ECSWN) dry version on the same day.

Noodle-wise, ECSWN is clearly the better stall. Their noodle is springy with a nice texture to it and well marinated, tasting different layers of flavour. For EWN (this stall), the flavour of the noodle tasted flat and the texture tasted undercooked.

Wanton-wise, ECSWN is again clearly the winner. Their wanton was meatier and well balanced in the marinate. EWN was disappointing; the wanton was much smaller and tasted plain salty.

Charsiew-wise, both stalls were about the same; both had good amount of fats and char.

Soup-wise, EWN was better. EWN's soup tasted real and hearty. Could taste that ECSWN's soup flavour was enhanced using msg."
"Nice noodles, comfort food. I wouldn't say it was mind blowing but above average"
Wantans are tiny and charsiew slices are paper thin
The chilli is good. Wantan mee just above average.
Love the fried wantons!
One of the best wanton noodles in Singapore!
"Nov 2019. I read about its raving reviews. I tried when i was on the way to my east office and felt it was just above average with 3 stars.
The noodle texture was ok, i didn't like the brightly dyed char siew, the star side dish - wanton - was just ordinary, there was no effort, no surprises in the wrapped meat ball.
The saving grace was the fiery chilli. The noodle was not served with chilli from the kitchen, the bottle was available at every table, consumed at own discretionary amount.
The 4th star was given to its courteous serving staff."
"Same old great taste
But ever since they accept grabfood delivery. Waiting time has been very long. I am sitting here first thing in the morning. No queue for seats but waited 15 mins for food as delivery folks keep streaming in"
Great noodles texture. Chili is extremely spicy but really good with the noodles!! Wanton is also very crispy.
Less crowded today
Better Soup than its opposite counterpart. Good food overall
"Not the best, but slightly above average"
Noodle hard and salty
Taste of the wantan noodle is normal n service was also bad even though the shop wasn't very crowded n busy.  Don't think I will go back again given the fact that there are so many other wantan noodle in this area.
"Like chinese fast food :) super simple but crazy delicious! It's quite oily, so if you're on a diet or cant have too much oil for some reason, just tell them to cut it down. Their fire chilli on the tables are my ultimate favourite "
"It was surprisingly average...
Not sure how the noodle is seasoned but it does taste very msg laden without much flavour. Wanton and char siu is alright, nothing amazing about it.
The worst is the goh hiang, even for $6, it taste extremely bland and without much ""bite"" to it.
Its ok to visit if you are around the area but it is not worth the effort to go out of your way to get here."
"Visited this place on a Public Holiday 28th Oct because the new ENG's shop was closed. Been here a few times (like once every 2-3 months) but usually patronise the new one (better service and quality)

Ordered a large size dry wonton noodle (dine-in) and thinking what could go wrong. When I start eating I notice the noodle size and texture are different and the chaw siew are sliced hastily (I mean very untidy cut, like messy) and worst of all, the wonton skin and meat are mostly detached.

Generally I feel that this place service and quality have degraded a lot. Disappointed and I really have to tell myself don't come again, every again."
Good wantan noodle
Good and quick service
"Over rated, banking on old reputation, if u like to pay premium for old world taste by all means"
Only the chilli is powerful.. else nothing nice!
Too salty....in fact alot saltier than before. Gonna try out the one opposite this.
"I used to love their noodles.  No longer.  They have more outlets now but there is no taste to the sauce. Either hardly any taste or bland, if there was any.  Tens outlet in Tiong Bahru dusappoints  When j asked for more sauce, I got salt water/ soup added to the dry noodles."
"Im' surprised to read the reviews that the business not owned by the original family as the giant posters seems to portray an emphasis on the family.

Any whoo.. the service is great. Good food and super hot chilli"
The entire ordering process is fast. Food is tasty. No fuss.
Nice wanton new. Should try their chilli
I have eaten Eng's since early seventies at his home outside garden on a push  cart at Duku road. Noodles were made by hand made by him. Nowadays it's all done by noodles factories so the taste is different. Still the best Cantonese wanton noodles in town
Best wanton but standard dropped a little
Their chilli sauce packs a punch! Yumz.
"Fiery but delicious wanton noodle! Believe them when they say the chilli is hot.

I learnt my lesson after my first visit and only added a little bit of the chilli for taste. It was perfect! Wantons are great."
This is not the family run business. This is now owned by Lao Huo Tang. Noodles consistency can vary with every visit. Taste is superb after all these years. Wantons seem to get a little smaller every time. . But still my go to place to placate my wanton mee craving.
Taste similar to Malaysia White Wanton Noodles. I think is more better than tomato or curry source Wanton Noodles in Singapore.
Paid sgd5.50 for a take away and the content is worse than a side wanton mee from the famous tiong bahru market wanton mee. They needs to think hard to win back customers.
Nice noodles!
Suits my liking. Some may not like this style of wanton noodles however...
nice but oily
"Noodles are thicker and chewier than other wanton stalls. Even eating it alone with the sauce is delicious.

I didn't try it with the chili though because even with just a drop, I can tell how spicy it is. Which in this case, it is SO spicy.

The boiled and fried wanton are great. Nice texture and flavour. It's also nice to see someone making and folding the wanton by hand unlike other wanton stalls that buy prepacked wanton, hence it is not fresh.

It's also interesting to see a container of lard that u can take to enhance the flavour of the wanton mee.

Overall, this place is not your normal wanton mee stall in a good way . Kudos!"
Wow nice taste....and hot chili 
Nice soup. Clean and simple  eating  place
"Great tasting Wantan Noodles. Got to try the Ngoh Hiang, authentic flavours. Beware the chilli paste, it stings but it's GREAT!

This place gets really busy during meal times. On the weekends it's almost madness with a queue outside."
Its really good!! Reasonable portions for its price and the fried wantons were great!
"Eng's Wanton Noodle tries to reinvent wanton mee.

I don't usually leave a review but as someone who grew up eating (and loving) wanton mee I feel rather strongly about Eng's, given the hype and heritage.

Wanton mee are served slightly differently across Asia, and I'm able to appreciate the variations be it Malaysian or Cantonese style. Never have I come across a wanton mee served with a Japanese style (think it's clear miso and wakame base) soup with noodles almost thick enough to pass off as spaghetti.

If your palate likes to be confused, enjoys biting into bitter vegetables, don't like springy noodles and will give 5 stars to really thick and floury noodles, Eng's the place for you."
No comment
I loves the chilli there. It's extra spicy. When I finish my meal. I ask the boss friendly if the chilli for sale and he reply no look not happy. But I seen him friendly with others. I don't know why
"The chilli is spicy and a highlight, don't eat it if you don't enjoy heat.  Noodles are lovely, and nice atmostphere inhouse.  Efficient staff and service, and prices are reasonable.  Would definitely come back a few times."
The noodles just above average not really that great.
"We have been to Eng's atleast 5 times if not more. Like almost all places in Singapore is it easily accessible by bus (no 10,32,134 and more), and within a walkable distance if you live around Katong.

First sign that you ll have a good meal in here - Not an elaborate menu - choose the noodles (soup or dry), the wanton (steamed or fried), greens and drinks - pay by nets or cash, serve some condiments like fried pork lard and enjoy your drink (i prefer the barley or water chestnut), until your food arrives.

The chili is a house specialty - beware it is truly hot.

Reasonably priced and portioned (you can always order large or multiple plates if you want).

I ll recommend to try and eat in-house than take away cause the trapped heat of the hot noodles in the plastic takeout in most cases over cooks the noodles (making them very sticky)."
Ordered the soup version at VivoCity. The soup taste bland but the wantons are flavourful. The char siew is also not fatty. In the end it's the green chilli that save the day. The cashier service could be better and more smiley.
Good wanton noodles place if you are looking for consistent quality. (;
Great taste and texture. The boiled wanton skin is a tad thick but the fillings are tasty.
Delicious pork lard
The noodles were not as nice and the chilli is overpowering. Won't consider it as a good dinner place. Wanton inside can taste the meat not fresh.
"I like the texture of the noodles albeit the thickness of the noodles. Chili sauce is really spicy as being warned on the label.  Wantons won my heart and I think I can just eat a dozen of them!
Will I come back again? Only if I'm around the area."
"Poor food quality. Though the price was cheap, it still doesn't justify the food."
"Very nice noodle texture, soup is nice and the flavor combination of pork lard and sauce is wonderful. Even the green chili flavor is well balanced. Definitely one of my favorite wanton noodle but might visit othe branches. This one's too crowded and service is slow."
Very nice boss (I guess he must be the boss) and food!
Good wanton noodles
"I tried the wanton noodle at GEM recently, it didnt live up to my expectation. The dry noodle & sauce is average and the wanton is salty .... i would recommend you try the soup base noodle instead as the soup is tasty and try their super spicy chilies sauce."
"Not sure if it's the branch at BPP, but I can't imagine giving three star or above. Ordered wantan noodle dry & soup. The soup really felt like water with bits of stock. Wantan tasteless. Even the famous chili lacks of spiciness. Lard had lots of burnt so tasted bitter. Honestly there are lots of better wantan noodle out there."
"We passed by this eatery and decided to try. The noodles taste heavenly even without chilli. Their super spicy chilli is very shiok too! And unlimited flow of pork lard (if u like pork lard you will love it) Drinks are refreshing and price for all is very reasonable. Place is spacious, bright and clean. Staff is very friendly and helpful."
My favourite! No queue today 
Probably the best wanton noodles in Singapore
"The lime light is the chilli sauce. Beware, consume at your own risk."
Authentic taste of Katong
Fast  & Friendly services. 
"Nice descent wanton noodle, with spicy chili"
The noddle is not hot enough. May be is not the right time to take the order. I go there aboit 3.30pm.
"Chili is straight out spicy, but noodles is too dry and starchy. Quite oily too...."
"If you like pork lard in your noodles, this is it. Very generous and shiok amount of that in the noodles and also in the dumplings."
"Noodle texture of my liking, drenched in fragrant lard."
Very nice noodle and the chilli is very spicy.
The noodles is very springy and chewy nice to eat. Price is on the cheap side.
One of the best Wan Ton noodles I had in SG. Noodle is springie. Both boiled & fried are delicious. Service is fast too. Not used to the local taste where they add chilli sauce into the noodle.
arguably the best WTM in SG
"Tried out this place due to the high ratings. A place with above average wantans but below average noodles. Noodles were abit tough and just not what I wanted. The taste of the wantans, charsiew, and noodles did not blend together as per what good Wantan noodles are supposed to be."
"Wanton mee was good, but charsiew could be better."
Good texture of the noodles and nice big wantons though slightly pricey given the inconvenient location
"One of the best wanton noodles in Singapore. I personally like this style alot because the noodles are top quality, great texture and bite. The seasoning is beautifully done with lard oil, personally I think thats THE only way to season noodles. Some wanton noodles in Singapore are done way too sweet, way too much dark sauce or chilli. Eng's however, give you the ability to control the chilli amounts as they leave the bottles on your table. Beware! The chilli is really spicy. Have a small touch of it with noodles and wanton and enjoy."
Great noodles!
Tried the wanton mee. the small one has hardly any meat. The wanton was very salty. the noodle was the highlight for me. overall its something you can eat and suitable for quick lunch in vivo.
Spring noodles with crunchy pork lard taste the best with its fiery chilli!
Traditional food good
"One of the best wantan noodle in Singapore. The chilli is not as spicy as I thought to be, but spicy enough. Good economical price and the self serve fried lard also taste very good."
Chilli is very nice! love their qq noodles as well with the pork lard. awesome!
Love their spicy chilli! Washing it down with water but it is so addictive!
Their handmade ngoh hiang is a must have! Order it everytime i'm there with my family!
Love the spicy chilli with the crispy wanton! My favourite combination!
Must try their chilli!
Best of the best. Love the chilli so much
"Love that they have so many outlets, easy to get my wtm fix!"
"Love the spicy chilli and tangy noodles, awesome! Best wtm in sg!"
the chilli is the best! my family and I really love the noodles and wanton
Slow and over rated
Nice wan tan noodles
Super spicy chilli the highlight as usual. But the noodles does not taste as good today for some reason
Good wonton noodle
"Went to the branch in amk hub mall,really it was not good ,no taste and a bland taste,Maybe the main brand one is nicer have not tried yet"
The chilli is sickkkk
"Can get crowded. Owners and staff friendly. Food is good. When crowded, can get stuffy and humid too."
Favourite! Springy noodles and lots of pork lard.
Awesome noodles
"If you like Singapore style wanton noodles, then this is one of the representatives. Beware of the chillies if you can't handle the heat."
"Hands down the best wonton mee in Singapore (well, together with the Eng's across the street). The noodle is super springy, tasty char siu, wontons and soup and, last but not least, super spicy hot sauce, all just the way wonton me is supposed to be. I was very sad when they closed down for a bit and now they are open again, I am a happy man. Oh and you can add as much pork lards as you want! This place is at the top of my list of recommended food places to go in Singapore, you definitely have to come and check it out!"
"Zhen De Hao Chi,Zai Zhe Li Si Tian Chi Liao San Ci,Mian You Jiao Jing,Cai Ye Fei Chang You Wei Dao!!"
My kind of wantan mee. Like the texture and taste of the mee. And generous amount of char siew. Also love the super hot chili sauce
"My favourite wanton noodles. Absolutely love it. Love the chilli too. The portions may be a bit small though. Even the large is not enough for me. Maybe I am just a big eater. There is a shop called wantan kia in Marine Parade that serves very similar wanton noodles as ENG's. Not sure if they are related in any way. But I still prefer ENG's. The chilli here is better. Ever since I tried ENG's wanton noodles, no other wanton noodle have been able to satisfy me."
Nice wantan noodle and fried dumpling.
the noodles are indeed delicious and qq
Average noodles at high price
"AMAZING noodles!! Noodles are so slick and smooth, will definitely come back! Owner was really friendly and helpful too."
Noodle is a bit lack of taste for me. But the hot chilli sauce is really helping to elevate the taste. The boiled and fried wantan are very nice though.
Nice. Noodles were chewy and fragrant. For those that love fried pork lard oil and spicy chilli sauce... This is the place for u...
Popular local wanton noodle shop in Singapore. Slight drop in standard in recent times.
Very nice wanton mee. Help urself with the chilli and pork lard.
"lousy food,poor service & poor hygiene!"
"Good value wanton mee, pork lard cubes made it even better, get the fried wantons!"
"Eng's Wantan Noodles is a pretty reliable establishment, as with any many local stalls who made their name in a single dish, cooking this till perfection.

Trying out different wantan noodles, what Eng's is famous for is their devilishly hot chili sauce. The chili is an excellent complement to the noodles, providing a tangy zing to the overall texture and taste of the noodles. Be warned though, I recommend that you do not put too much at one go, but rather to drop little dabs of sauce and add more as you deem fit."
"Be careful of the chilli, just put abit will do. If you can't handle the spiciness i suggest 2-3 drops, legit."
"Great food, friendly staff and owner. Highly recommend!"
Love the waton noodles
Good food. Lots fo people during dinner. Parking is bad.
noodle is not springy nor al dente. bbq pork is dry. soup is okay.
"Good wanton mee. Please bring cash only. Careful, there's another shop nearby that is a knock off."
Wantan mee fix--try their fried wantans too
"The food is no doubt awesome. Let me explain why I take 3 stars away.
2 star taken away  is because they don't accept nets or credit card. I am travelling with 2 hungry kids and have to find an ATM for about 15 mins before I can find one.
Another  star is taken away is because the staff and boss keep staring at me and came over to clear bowls whenever one is finished. Feels so stressful eating here. They are just thinking of making money. Definitely not Family friendly. Have to take my own baby utensils from few tables away."
1st time having the noodles last week- heard they renovated and reopened after some time. But thought the noodles were abit dry. My friend who I was has had the noodles before- says standard dropped unfortunately.
"Delicious taste, but need extra meats. And thank you for friendly resto owner, he offering an umbrella for us because heavy rain last time. :)"
"Not bad, but nothing special and there's a lot of other wantan mee in Katong and Joo Chiat to try."
Very close to kch kolome
Taste is quite off previous standard... disappointed.
"Eng's is consistently good !
For newbies, it's wanton noodles to be taken w overdose of chilli n it's still good if you don't do the chilli route .."
"Amazingly great noodle ! It is a special noodle, literally smaller than the  normal yellow noodle but thicker than meekia. Interestingly no need for any soy sauce and it tasted good. Go buy their dried wonton which is crispy and tasty too. Chilli sauce in a bottle for you to squeeze own time own target. Worth the try !"
Hao Chi E!
Easily one of the top 3 wanton noodles in Singapore. Noodles are the highlight for this dish as it is springy and uniquely tasty
"Very good noodle. The chili is a must try, be careful though, it is very hot"
favourite lunch wantan noodle.. best is the chili!!
Comfort Malaysia style white wanton noodle
The chilli is super hot but overall nothing exceptional to be honest.
Good wanton Noddles
Noodle taste great.. Now have to deal with rival across the road.
"Both ENGS ( the one opposite) serve top notched wanton noodles,  frankly I couldnt tell the difference when I visited the first time."
"The Wantan mee is not always al -dente and fluctuates .  Been there more than a dozen times ,sometimes the noodles served tend to lump together, perhaps due to time constraints otherwise its very 'Q' .  It is very popular at meal times so be prepared to wait around 20 mins and up.I recommend ordering the smaller bowl as the larger bowl merely has more noodles and  the Char siew quantity remains the same for both .Should be renamed (Keh Liao)(extra ingredients) for the Big bowl version to justify the price difference."
Food is ok
Flavourful but watch out for the chilly its really hot
V ordinary
Very old school Wantan noodles (the firm kind). Tasty!. Killer chilli sauce!
Ok la food
Quality deteriorates a lot Co. Pared to just a few months ago. I'm disappointed. This used to be my favorite Noodle place
Disappointed with the food quality and cooking standard.  I saw good rating and tried out here yesterday.  Not worth the money.
one of the best noodle in town...
Very Good Place. They Serve Delicious Wonton Mee. Rate It 4 Stars Because Of The Drink Price.
Springy noodles. Spicy sauce 
If u love wan tan noodle must dine here
Good wanton mee although quality can be a little inconsistent. Although not as good as they were during their duman hawker center days but still a good bowl of noodles nonetheless
"The noodles tasted hand made with a nice bite to it.  I had the soup version, which has a homey tasting soup, bland in a good wholesome way - no msg. The char siew and wanton is ok, nothing to shout about. The fried wanton is average too. Being a fan of spicy food, I do not fill their super hot chilli spicy at all, more like salty. Overall, it is worth checking this wanton noodles out because it has the authentic homemade touch that is unlike those at food court and hawker centre using factory noodles and msg laden food."
The best wonton noodle in Singapore
"If you are looking for local style wonton noodle, this will be the right place"
As usual...noodle was unique. They hv improved the taste of their soup
very nice wanton mee the pork lard fat pork thing is also very nice. PLEASE DON'T CLOSE DOWN I LOVE THE WANTON MEE
"Everything gets so salty, from mee, wanton & chilli. Get thirsty very fast"
"Springy noodles done just right,   Must catch the Fried chicken next time"
Was looking for something simple and fuss free so we were pleasantly surprised that the food turned out so good. Very pleased to discover this gem along Tanjong Katong Rd!
Pretty good if you can take chili
What can go wrong when your chewy noodles are paired with fiery chili and crispy pork lard! Price is a little bit on the high side though.
One of the best wanton mee in Singapore.
"A diner at the next table remarked to his partner, 'Standard drop' when they finished their meal. That disappointment he expressed encapsulates our experience there.

The portions were OK for the price but the sauce, wanton were just too salty. Way too salty. Their noodles make them stand out if you like eggy versions.

$1.50 for the drinks were reasonable. And much needed to wash away the saltiness."
Efficient service and superbly springy noodles. Yummy! Love the simple but clean setup.
"Great wanton noodles
Long queue and dont put too much chilli..."
Tried the Eng stall at AMK Hub. Ordered dry wanton mee with wanton soup. Noodles springy as always. Chilli shiok. The disappointment is the fillings in the wontons. Really thin... Felt short changed for a 5 dollar wanton soup.
the chilli makes all the difference
It's pretty good
"Best wanton noodles I had in Singapore so far. Noodles tasted handmade, the wantons were tasty, and the spicy sauce was bringing a nice heat. Calamansi drink was good too and not overly sweet. And it is reasonably priced. Will definitely come back again and recommend to others."
"So delicious , noodle is very good , the soup and sambal is awesome"
One of favourite noodles.
"Al dente noodles paired with juicy and crispy wontons. The chilli sauce is extremely spicy, use it sparingly. Love that they provided free flow of fried crispy pork lard. Will definitely come back for more!"
Live the chilli!
"Good quality food, but abit tad too ex haha would reccomend thou"
"I order some dinner from ENG's using the grab food app.I am guessing the food was prepared at the simei outlet.
When the food arrived i must say i was utterly disappointed!
I ordered a large portion of the boiled wanton soup.The wantons were sent to me but there was no soup.
I ordered a large portion of the fried wantons.But the mayonaise was not provided.
And the best part, i was not given any chilli at all, which Eng's is supposedly famous for.
Hence i am having my cold and bland dry wanton mee because Grab does not provide redelivery service.

I am a big fan of the food from ENG's.But i have realised a trend that whenever i order from a food app,there are always items missing.And when i ask for extra chilli,i dont even get any chilli.Very slipshot service!
For some reason the staff tend to stinge on your 'Famous' chilli.

In the future, please ensure that your staff check through the order before handing it over to the delivery driver."
I love their noodles which are very QQ with a good savory soup and wanton! Do note that the chilli sauce is very spicy!
best wanton noodle
A simple affair; probably the best wanton mee in the country. No more or less.
"Order a bowl of dry wantan noodle with Wantan soup. The pork minces filling is so little that I felt like eating only wantan skin .. more like a wantan skin noodle.

To be fair and the only reason for me to rate  the 2 stars, the noodle was extremely good.

Overall, no point eating unless u really like the noodle or Wantan skin."
"Tasty char siew, but noodles are way overcooked and sauce used was some sort of transparent oily kind (not using those traditional dark soy sauce). Order the small, as the big bowl is the portion is not much different."
"Tasty dish with al-dente springy noodles & flavorful soup. If you are in the neighborhood, go try. Or if you like starchy noodles, go try too. But I will not travel out of my way or join a queue to eat it."
"Simply fantastic wanton noodles. The chilli, oh the chilli...."
"One of the most F'up service and queuing system in town. Will never ever visit this brand anymore, even it's for free."
"was last here 3 years ago. killer chili sauce still rocks but they've changed the size and texture of noodles-it now has egg added to wheat & is slightly larger in diameter. probably had to adapt for the machine made noodles. to purists like mom it's a drop in standard but if you didn't know better it's still yum. oh they've also expanded island wide so you now can taste eng's noodles at east point mall, amk hub & west gate."
"Taste is ok but the waiting time for take away at the amk hub outlet is horrible. There isn't even any queue but it took more than 30mins to prepare my one take away serving. I will not visit again, would rather go to the main outlet or the rival outlet instead."
It's so worth it. I have to eat here at least twice a week.
"waited 20 mins for the order, wanton meat size not bigger than 10cents, very very little char siew, nothing special about the noodles, wanton and soup. OVER PRICE. first and last time eating there."
Pretty meh.
Food's good and ambience is nice
"Decent enough, food is good, service could be a bit sharper."
"Fave wanton mee place. Noodles are springy, chili is good. Fried wanton is tasty."
"Standard dropped, so little char siew and wantoon"
Love the al dente noodle and the super chilli. Wish there's more char siew
World Class Chilli
"Lard-coated springy noodles, paired with sweet char siew... boy this is as good as it gets. Have it with their fried wantons and oiled vegetables for a whole ""wanton"" meal!"
Love this noodle and the spicy Chilli! first recommended by friend and been loving it since. Its been 8 years
Standard dropped
Good wonton mee in Singapore
Bought 4 wanton mee at that new outlet at AMK hub. The noodle is so bland that I need to add Ketchup and light soy sauce. Why is it getting so many good reviews? Or is it that there should be sauce that we need to add ourselves at the counter?
"Not my type of noodles, so I will just provide a conservative opinion here. Prices are rather high for wanton mee. Perhaps it's because I have a more preferred place to go fix my wanton mee craves."
"Nice Chewy Noodles. Very spicy chilli. Add a little tastes good already, so just try 1st before adding more."
The chilli sauce is best!
My favourite at the moment
"The last time I ate this they were still at the dunman food centre. What stand out is their noodle, texture perfectly cooked till al dente. The wantons were rather saltish and the char siew lackluster. Their 'famous' chilli sauce still ultra spicy but frankly I just don't understand what is so nice about it. I am one who could take real spicy food  and I don't mind having it once in a blue moon if I happen to pass by it just for the hack of it but won't travel all the way to have it."
Its a nice go to place for good wanton mee
Good comfort food and super efficient service
"Standard going downhill just like our economy. Have been a loyal patron even after the divorce btw the partners. Noodles used to be firm n tasty, now its drier than my bank account."
"Split into 2 stalls now. I tried both, frankly both still good. Much better tha. Your average wanton noodles. Though the best was still prepared by uncle eng. Godspeed uncle eng."
excellent noodles. boiled to perfection. the pork lard is a delight.
"Love the noodle and chilli, it's been my favourite for quite sometimes"
"Noodle texture is good. However, really too oily and salty for my taste buds. Really a pity:("
Recommended wanton noodle in tanjong katong area. Delicious soup same taste like miso shiru (but without tofu n seawee).. order big size for 5.5 SGD and additional sidedish fried wanton big size 5 sgd to share with other people. Should come again here
Pretty average.. nothing different. But soup is nice hence 2 stars.
Delicious wanton mee and super spicy addictive chilli sauce
I am disappointed because only the noodle texture is nice. The rest are below food court standard.

"There are 2 Engs Noodle houses at this stretch of Tanjong Katong Road. One who is the son, and one is the business owner. Have tried both and preferred the son's wanton mee as the wanton is nicer. =)"
New store has air con and much more space to sit. Food is as good as the old one.
"There are TWO Eng's in Tanjong Katong. This review is the stall that has been in Tanjong Katong for at least 5 or more years. Noodles are served in GREEN colored bowls. The stars of the show are the noodles and the chilli (hot!). Char siew is mediocre, wantan is passable."
"I have visited this place over 20 times already in 2 months I've stayed here in Singapore. I absolutely love the food. I always order the entire menu as they have limited items. Even though the cheerful owner is quite surprised with my huge appetite. But the food is so good, I can't get enough of it everytime.
Highly recommended!! Must visit"
Food is delicious..especially it cimpliments wit the all you can eat pid rind.
Uses a thicker kind of noodle unlike others but tastes great. Unlimited pork lard tastes great too. The char siew is not good tho.
"Decent wanton mee that evokes childhood memories, but beware of the chilli as it is extremely hot."
Very good... chilli... power... I think that is the trick!!
Nice but noodle very salty.
"Simple and original wanton noodles, like in Hong Kong. $4.50 for a small one. You can add chilli from a bottle provided."
"Let me tell you, if you like wanton noodles and you have not been here - get here quick."
"Wantan noodle is good. Nice deco, friendly service and reasonable price."
"The noodles are dry and doughy and oily, when you kiap up the noodles, the whole bowl of noodles kena kiap up, the noodles all stick together. And the service is not as good as the one across the street. This shop is basically run by a bunch of old Ah Bengs."
"The boiled wanton is one of my favourites!
And the best is their noodles! Chewy with sesame oil for non spicy. For the spicy lover, their Chilli is NO JOKE! Overall experience,  5/5!"
"ONE OF THE BETTER ONES

Noodle texture al dente. Wantons boiled are tasty but the fried ones too much skin. I like the chilli sauce. It's the traditional 1980s kind of coffee shop chilli sauce that is hard to find now. Overall one of my go to places for wanton mee fix."
Awesome! Noodle was yummy ! Fried wanton was so crispy. My 8 year old love it so so much! No regrets and will definitely be back for my Wantan Noodle fix. No forgetting service was top notch!
Super spicy noodle love it (~_^)
Very old & traditional style noodle & chaisirw
Nothing much to comment but always crowded.
"Tried the Wantan Mee Dry ($4.50 or $5.50), the fried wantan ($3 or $5), the boiled wantan ($3 or $5), Vegetable ($3 or $5).

Chili is very hot and unsalted; meant to be mixed with the noodles.  Noodles by itself were a bit on the saltish side but with chili they were good (be careful as thechili is hot).  Noodles were good  with bite but just a tad starchy. Decent portion, including ingredients.

Fried wantan was warm and nice; bitsy bit saltish.  Boiled wantan was not mixed well and looked dry and sticky (a pity as mixing is so easy).

Vegetables were good and we had a decent portion.  And soup has somewhat a miso flavour/taste.

Inevitably comparions will be made with the other Eng shop across the road some 50m away.

This shop has improved from the time they were the only one around.  There are more fans, more space (the fridge was relocated) and they have the blue light insect killer (did not see any fly around).  Still no aircon though.  Fresh coat of paint and looks cleaner. And service has improved for sure.

Food quality did not change but overall from last time.

Comparatively speaking, the newer shop has an edge.  Quality wise I will eat any.  And I am quite glad that there are 2 shops serving decent wantan noodle at affordable price. But overall - ambience, presentation, service - I will prefer the newer shop across the road."
"The noodles are cooked ""just-nice"". For those ""hard"" noodles lovers, it's definitely a must-try wanton noodle dish. I always can't have enough of their normal portion of noodles and go ahead with ""add noodles"" "
"Came for the noodles, stayed for the hot sauce   "
"It's the firm noodles that make this spot great. Nice soup, soft juicy thin cut pork and wontons are delicious too."
Great tasting wanton noodles with extra spicy chili sauce (must not miss!) and unlimited pork lard! Friendly service crew too! All time favorite!
The wonton noodles were pretty average. Didn't hit the spot for me. Coupled with the side dishes it was quite expensive for a wonton mee meal compared to other better eateries.
"Revisiting after 2 years. Wantan noodles still the hokkien variety, char siew is shamefully bland and noodles just a notch better than Wang's instant noodles. They still have take-all-you-can pork fat and best green vegetables this side of town. Service is 5-star. Food 2-star. Prices - see stars"
"No frills place to get a good plate of wonton mee. They literally serve nothing else other than wonton, wonton mee and maybe some veg.

Imo it was very tasty but it was a tad bit too oily for my liking.

But it is very cheap. Good place to bring tourists looking to taste some decent wonton mee!"
Nice food n very casual place.
Very special & unique wanton mee with higher cost as compare others
My fave Noodle in Singapore
Fast service & good
Long time wanton noodle shop. Most dish I find its on the oily side.
"The staff attitude was terrible. We park the car behind the building and decide to enter the shop by the back entrance of the shop. We were approached by a mid age man and asking what we want.
We told him we were still considering and at the end decided not to try.
He told us this is not a public place and we shouldn't walk pass it and kept yelling to my family until we were all out from the shop. I told him we will never be back forever and he kept quiet although a sudden wake up call of customer service."
Best! Must get more pork lard!
"The original owners from Eng's, the old premises was run by the ex head Chef. Tastewise very similar."
"The standard of wanton noodle has really dropped. No zest, very salty & unappetizing. With much regrets that we went."
There is another one with similar name on the opposite side of the road. I overheard another passer-by mentioned that it is opened by a close relative (apparently a family feud?). Will be keen to find out if food standard is the same for both chains
"Great wanton noodle, and the area boasts a lot of cool cafes and ice cream shops. Great place and would recommend for a relaxed dinner."
"Flavourful taste.  Not too badz...but personal taste preference is more to the blend side, thus find it abit saltish.  Careful of the chilli sauce..suggest u try it out 1st b4 putting in...can get really flaming hot!! :D"
The chilli is really addictive but wasn't as spicy as I thought and I poured a lot of them on the noodles.  Enjoyed the chilli very  much. The char siew is okay but vegetables are not tasty. Overall okay given the price of 4.50 so not very value for money considering the small portion
Great simple noodle. The noodle was crunchy and the chill was superb. Wanton was soft and melts in your mouth. Come and get a piece of a superb heritage meal.
They let you decide how spicy you choose your noodles to be. Please heed the warning on the chilli bottle!
"Always been a fan of ENG. Recently there is another ENG which is directly opposite but i have yet to try it. I went to the old one,the standard of the food is still very good, in fact, the staffs became friendly. Probably because of the competition. Still one of the best wan tan noodles in Singapore. Especially if you like spiciness"
Spacious and windy environment. Ok food taste overall. Soup taste abit off the shelf.
Noodle very hard..pork oil not fresh.
Very good wanton noodles!! The chill is a must but it's very spicy!
It is similar to kok kee wanton mee to me. Tip here is to ask for more sauce. Will come back to satisfy my cravings!
Love the texture of the noodles!
Very much overrated. Their famous chilli sauce is very spicy and a lil sour but doesnt add fragrance to the food. Service is good though.
Hmmmm it's just marvellous how traditions are kept growing within the family .we exchanged Lots of nostalgic moments of GEYLANG  KATONG N THE BOO CHIAT BOYS .Owner always present to ensure highest standard of service n cuisine
Love the chili sauce here.
"Must try the Dry Wantan Noodle and the Fried Wantan.
And the staffs are very friendly."
Nice noodle. Wanton is abit salty.
"The mid age guy owner was very welcoming despite the restaurant filled up on a Sunday afternoon. He seemed really care about his business, unlike most other busy restaurants you could find in Singapore. The noodles was pretty spot-on with the right combo of chewiness and flavor. Too bad they're out of fried pork lards so quick that we didn't get any. We don't live in the area, but have traveled to Katong just for their bowl of noodles (with fried pork lards, if we're lucky enough.)"
Great handmade noodles. The menu is really simple and food is delicious..
Standard dropped
Nice Wantan mee!
Their dry wanton noodles are the best in town
Great food. Owner takes personal pride in ensuring your pleasure in his fare.
Not as good as the past.
Love the taste of the noodle! But both the wanton and char siew taste above average.
"IMO, Much over rated. Noodles are good, but to chat siew and the Santo is below average. The wanton is cold, they don't even bother to heat it up."
"Same good old wonton noodle from the ""original"" shop across the street. Menu is identical, a tad saltier than expected. Good for peeps who likes stronger taste. Overall bigger and brighter and is airconed :)"
 their chilli are very hot.noodles aee very Q.
Near perfect wanton noodle especially for those who love their carbo spicy.
Able to help oneself to all the pork lard
"When you have craving, this is the place to go to"
Nothing remarkable
Not entirely healthy but by far healthy enough as it isnt salty or sweet. Mixed with vinegar and light sauce. Quite an interesting type of wantan noodle. Generally good and worth the visit!
Best chilli in town. Go hot or go home
I will not pay the price they charge and stomach their bad service. Taste is ok. There are plenty of better options around. Will not be back.
Need to train staff to be polite to members of their customers
"Seriously, the quality of the wanton mee had dropped for both shops.  I had gone to both shops and found both disappointing. However, i might consider going to support the real descendants of the Eng family, the service there is much better than the other one in the original shop."
Perfect noodles and sauce
Great noodles but the soup wasn't fantastic.
Nice place for wanton mee. consistent taste after renovation
"Service is not good (not horrible) but still think it's the best wanton mee in Singapore. Noodles are springy and goes amazingly well with the chilli and their tasty wantons. Prefer the boiled wantons over the fried ones.

Edit: New management...new suppliers? Seems like the noodles got thicker and less salty. Wantons now have more skin than meat and are less tasty. Have been eating eng's almost weekly for years, really disappointed with the change. Hope the other eng's manages to maintain the taste.
(NB: must say that the new staff are much friendly though)"
"I've heard a lot about this supposedly famous Eng's Wanton Noodle when I returned to Singapore in 2013 (after 10 years abroad) and its super fiery chili sauce. I have eaten it during their days in Dunman Food Centre in the 1980s but not when they moved into a shophouse at 287 Tanjong Katong Road. I finally got around to try it in 2017 and have not returned as it did not live up to my expectations; noodles were al dente but not QQ and chilli sauce not as tongue searing as touted, fried wanton was crispy but left no impression if they were tasty (overall experience, Koung's Wan Tan Mee in Geylang and Guangzhou Mian Shi Wanton Noodle in Tanglin Halt Road are more to my palate).

Found out that hawker Ng Ba Eng, the man who started the business had passed on and the shop was run by his son and business partner. The son and business partner split up in 2016, due to differing views in running the business and Desmond Ng parted ways with his father's biz partner. Maybe that's the reason why it didn't taste as good as touted? Lao Huo Tang Group (soup chain) took over the lease for the 287 Tanjong Katong Road shop, and re-opened the eatery in April 2018. That said, Desmond has also opened his own shop ""Eng's Char Siew Wantan Mee"" at 248 Tanjong Katong Road on 13th May 2018       . I have yet to try both eateries but I am hearing/seeing more favourable reviews for Desmond's with more QQ noodle texture and fragrant chilli sauce."
Springy noodles with super hot chilli
Efficient service and tasty noodles.
"Very good wanton mee. Noodles were springy, not overcooked."
"Pls note the original store has moved across the road. The address is now No 248/ 250. Hasn't tried the new store taking up the geographical location of the old store~

The plates are no longer green so the color of the food looks a tad different. The white LED isnt helping.

But the chilli is still good ;) wanton feels a bit bigger. And the mee slightly thicker. Live and let live..."
"Noodles taste good, my children love the fried wanton,comfort food and staff very friendly and helpful."
"There are two outlet the old shop at 287 belong to a new owner which they are using back most of the old staff. The new outlet across the carpark 248/250 belong to the old owner son who are using back Mr Eng picture in store and bigger shop and more siting space with lots of fans in there but the air con is switch off which make place very warm.

I felt the old shop the food quality seem better and bigger potion the noodle given is more and wanton skin is thinner and less salty. The one at 248/250 noodle seem lesser and wanton skin thicker and more dry but maybe staff are new and pork lard was not seen also soup not serve.

Overall if it your first time eating you may not tell the different but ppl who eat always will know. Also what most important is the staff/boss attitude face very black can spoilt your day. You all guess which one yourself and feel yourself."
"Queue is slightly long, but staff efficient and friendly, wait is shorter than expected. Food overall not bad, best is their char siew. Price wise is just slightly expensive, still affordable."
"First time trying out. I always wonder what's so special about wan tan mee. When i first eat it, taste really yummy as the noodle is different type of noodles & taste really nice .

Tried the Dry wantan mee alongside with fried wantan n Vegetables. The vege is tasty too. They also have super hot chili ( really hot) & pork lard for the noodle 

I must say it's really with standard & portion is big . Will want to visit again if I have the chance. Do try it if u haven't try yet!"
"Been going there for about 4 years now and the springy noodles never fail to impress. Though the dishes might be a little pricey (for those running on a tight budget), I would still give it a 5"
Best wonton noodle! This has to be my favorite amongst the many that I've tried. Love the texture of the noodles.
Pretty good wanton noodles here. Magic is the chilli which adds flavour to the noodles. Service is soooo much better after the change in management.
"Newly renovated and move from existing location, this Chinese noodle stall has moved across the road. If you want to taste an old time favourite dish, think of Wanton Mee, this is the place to dine. My family have always enjoy this dish for countless times. The chilli which is in a bottle is priceless."
I come back here all the time. Seems like quality has been reduced in recent weeks
Taste a bit different after reopen. Still eatable. But prepare to wait when during peak hours.
"Among the top three best wanton mee places in SG, if you ask me. The wantons are top notch and the soup is also very good. Go easy on their famous hot sauce!"
Nice noodle but usually a queue
Best wanton mee
"Great food, improved service but very warm if dining in."
Best chilli noodles in sg! Must try!
Still enjoying the wanton noodles with the chilli sauce and sprinkling of bak por. But serving seems to be getting smaller.
The chili sauce will blow the top of your head off
They used to at duman food centre as on of the two wanton mee there . Famous for the orange like chill paste sauce but the service at this new loc is poorer
Hao Chi La Jiao Hao La
Very flavourful wanton noodles.
Hen Pu Tong Mei Shi Me Te Bie Mian You Dian Ying Jiang Liao Yao Jia Qiang Kou Gan Mian Qiang Ke Yi Yong Can Huan Jing Re Yao Gai Jin You Dian Shi Wang Bu Hui Qu Di Er Ci
Whats the point in just tadting the chilly paste n not the taste of wanton noodle.
"Delicious tangy noodle and juicy wanton. However, quantity was reduced than before and price is not cheap for wanton noodles."
One of the best noodle in singapore
"Great noodles and chilli. If you generally can't take spicy food, go easy on it (tea spoon size). It can get rather crazy during lunch time so it's advisable to go before 12"
"Still good as ever, the service has improved tremendously."
"Good service, good food"
I would come back again and again for these noodles!!!
Food is ok to me
"They re-opened on the 9th this month after reno n management restructuring.   Their food quality n services really improved compared to b4.  Noodles r more qq,  wanton meats n char siew r tenderer.   More important is their boss, Jason Sim ,and staff,  r much more frdly vs the previous lady boss n team .  The renovated noodle house looks neat n tidy,  they even installed hanging hooks beside the table legs for customers to hang their bags,  which is useful & caring especially during busy hours when the place is packed.   Will definitely come back again with all these improvements.
(My old comments with 2 stars 10mths ago:
Over-rated Singapore style wanton mee stall probably bcos of their goodie famous name in the old time.  I hv been there a few occasions n their noodles quality is inconsistent.  Once encountered a rude services frm their lady boss who refused to provide a spare bowl for us to feed a young kid n her reason is they r closing in 20 min.  I hv been eating so many local style wanton mees n rated this one is so so only despite their chilli sauce is spicy enough n lime juice zest tastes well. Feel so sad for this legend having their descending food quality.)"
I felt that the noodles did not taste as good as before and the chilly wasn't that hot too.
A little salty. Normal wanton
"Somehow the noodles, boiled wanton and fried wanton isn't as good as before. Seems like change of management too."
Super wonton
"over priced, bad service, mediocre food with a lady boss oversized ego. ok to miss. plenty of cheaper and better options nearby"
Very tasty noodles. For info: it's closed for renovation till April 9th.
Nice noodles. Must try. Yummylucious
"Engs noodles house is one of or the best wonton noodles in Singapore depending on your preference on noodle texture. If you really like chewy noodles and ghee taste, then this is the place for you. Just be careful of their chilli sauce. The warning label is real."
"The wanton mee they serve here is definitely one of the best you can get in Singapore. They sell small and large sizes, small for $4 and large for $5 (if I remember correctly). They also have side dishes like fried wanton and vegetables. There is also a bottle of very, very spicy chilli for each table."
Wanton is nice and chilli is super spicy.
Loving their super spicy chill!
Unique noodles. But closed since 28 feb 2018. Staff says that they are looking for a new location to operate as the rental contract was.expired
"Nice noodle, not soggy. Plain looking but taste good. Hope it will shift to a place not too far away."
BEST WAN TAN NOODLES SG
Super hot wanton noodle
"Love the texture of the noodles and taste of the chilli. Sadly, they're moving at the end of Feb, with location still unknown."
Great traditional wanton.noddle. What.a.pity they are closing down...
Nice noodles
"Noodles are light and not sticky and ""yeasty"", and their famous chilli sauce never fails to fire me up."
"It's really just a simple dish but it's exactly why I loved it so much. The sauce is savory and simple without complications like chili, tomato or dark sauce. If you do love spicy food, then add the super spicy home made chili to the amount you prefer. Noodles is al dante and ""Q"", just the right amount of chewiness. Not to forget the soup is free flow!"
Noodle a bit salty
Super hot chilli
"Nice wanton Mee. However, the price point and portion here doesn't make this overall satisfying. I would prefer the other stall at Dunman. The wantons there are juicier, portion larger and cheaper."
"The wanton are the nicest items on the menu. The quality of the noodles is not consistent - on some days, it is well-cooked; on others, it is under-cooked."
"Not a bad wanton mee. The noodle were thicker and the sauce appeared to be mixed with pork lard, thus flavourful. Not a bad choice overall but price is slightly on the expensive side given the portion"
"Egg noodles are al dente, the kind of texture I like. Wantons are flavour bombs. Super spicy chilli - a few dabs are enough to give you a kick. This is pretty much drenched in lard. It's great but can be an overkill for some."
Love the mee
Good food but pricey for Wanton noodles.
Best Wanton mee in the neighbour. The chilli is very spicy but it is the one that makes this food taste really good. Price is affordable. Recommended.
Fantastic noodle. Chilli is a MUST try
"Loved the springy noodles, esp. with the signature super spicy bright orange chilli. Standard of the food is 80% consistent. Have their gd & bad days. Free flow fried pork lard usually run out after evening."
The wonton mee here is fantastic
Not bad. Wish they had better sauce though.
"Very tasty noodles with great spring and bounce
Chilli sauce is genius."
Best Wanton Noodles !!! Watch the chilli sauce .. its 10* spicy !! 
"Slightly pricey, well known for their chilli sauce"
"Fantastic noodle house. Traditional wanton mee. Noodles are great, not too oily and the house made chili sauce is just wonderfully spicy!"
Nice wanton mee
Well I really enjoy  my meal
Live nearby so constantly craving for wanton Mee! Go during non peak hours so that you don't have to queue :)
"Super spicy sauce, super tasty noodles. Loving everything about this place. Would love for them to operate 24hrs but unfortunately they don't. Still, would recommend!"
"Very nice, the chili is quite spicy and overall a good wanton mee place"
"Nice noodle, portion is small and a bit pricey."
"Great food and atmosphere, if you want a taste of what marine parade is really like then you won't find it better anywhere else"
"You notice where the place is by the q at the entrance. Having said that the q moves pretty fast especially if you are in a pair or alone.

The noodles are the main reason why many are here. I prefer the dry version which is well seasoned, tasty and q (al dente). The noodles are quite like the (original in Johor not the franchise) Pontian's wanton noodles and doesn't have the dark sauce but likely pork lard, which gives it flavor.

The advantage of this shop is that since its the only option in the kopitiam, it's items shift very quickly which ensures that its freshly made. We enjoyed the fried wanton because it is really crisp.

The turn over is pretty quick and its not a place for lingering as it is not air conditioned and the seats are your traditional wooden ones. Getting there is fairly easy with a number of buses plying the route and a car park behind the row of shop houses.

Will definitely be back and the noodles itself is rewarding enough for you to make the trip if you stay a bit further away."
Good wonton mee. One of my favourites
A must visit wanton noodle for die hard lovers
Very good wanton noodles. Probably one of the best in Singapore. The noodles are flavorful and tangy. Slightly Thicker noodles are used than the norm. This complement the strong flavor of the seasonings. Wanton and soup are also very tasty and yummy. However the chilli can be too spicy for the norm so not advised to add in. Overall a good experience with the service and ambience.
Good noodles.
The fried wontons were overdone during our visit. Noodles were certainly different from other vendors. Chili is spicy but it had a pharmaceutical taste to it.
"The dry wanton mee was superb and cooked to Al dente. Not only was the food flavourful, the service was quick and fast. The place had a nice rustic old school feel with walls plastered with a quick history lesson of Eng's noodles."
Boiled wanton is amazing. But the star is the chili.
"This place can get crowded real fast, expect waiting times. Noodles are good, the chilli sauce is very spicy. So be careful of how much you add."
"Excellent springy noodles. But slightly salty. Be prepared to guzzle water after the meal. Also, chilli is awesome but as the warning says, it's VERY hot."
I love the wanton mee.. specially come here to dabao from woodlands!!:-) noodle is very qq and the service is very friendly!!;-)
Nice food but lousy service and expensive pricing.
"Closed every alternate Monday, was closed today 041217"
Noodles are springy. Sauce is great. The only let down is the char siew.
Hands down one of the best wanton noodles in Singapore!
"Wan Ton  noodles with extra kick of spiciness. Beware, it can be spicy. Parking easily available behind the shop."
Yummy noodle. Very good texture w yummy sauce. But it would had been the perfect wantan mee if the wanton is nicer.
Nearby public carpark and good food!!!
A pleasant outlet and the wanton Mee is above average. Easy place for parking as they have a public carpark behind.
Always packed
Not too crowded and food is consistently good. Fried wanton is a must order!
One of my favourite noodles in Singapore. Strongly recommended! But be prepared to wait for long queue on weekends. Closed on alternate Monday
"Good wanton noodles, a little oily but worth the occasional visit."
"Very nice unique Wanton Noodles that tastes good without any sauce. Chilli lovers will add tons of the hot and spicy chilli sauce to go together with the tasty noodles! The dumplings and char siew are good too! Only down point is the price, it is a little pricey to make it a daily meal."
Great noodles at affordable prices.
Amazing wonton mee in east coast and probably one of the best in Singapore. Be careful with the spicy chilli sauce and get the top quality noodles in couple of sizes depending on how hungry you are.
It's decent wanton noodles. Small selection of food items. Enjoyed the very spicy chili sauce. The wantons were on the mushy side.
We happened to be around the area and needed to try it since we love noodles. And for $4.5 a bowl it tasted really good!!!!!! From the noodles to the soup.. you feel like you can eat more!  Ps. Cash only
Great noodles
The noodles are to die for... in my opinion... Can't go a week without eating here at least twice!
The service is fast and the restaurant is very clean! I enjoyed my noodles very much :)
Serving their unique version of the wanton noodles with their special chilli.
"So far good wonton noddle at Singapore.
A little bit oily for some, fast service, free flow pork lard , nice chili very spicy . Good for kids and family"
"Food is acceptable , easy to find parking lot during weekdays"
Good Malaysian style wonton noodles.
Pricey for a bowl of wanton noodles but the serving is reasonable and the chilli is power packed. Highly recommended!
Super hot chilli and qq noodles!
"One of the best wanton mee I have tasted. I like their noodles, char siew and wanton. Its always with the queue, if you don't mind waiting."
world best wanton noddles
"Been here many times! I would say that their wanton mee is a bit different from the normal one that you find from the hawker stores.

The chili makes a punch and is super spicy but is taste so good! If you cannot take the spiciness, then opt for the tomato sauce which is a kids favorite!

The wanton is also pack with meat and gives a good stratification every time you bite into one.

Updated:

Went back again recently and somehow their wanton is more salty. I hope is just that batch that day."
Great noodles!
The noodles  and the wanton mee is  nice
"Hands down my favorite wanton mee in Singapore. The fat springy noodles lathered in lard plus the super spicy chili does it for me.

Queue during weekday lunchtime moves quite quickly. Coffee shop is not air conditioned but it's clean and very well ventilated."
Nice wanton noodles.
Great noodles n wantons
"Love the noodles here. Chilli is extra hot, so you gotta beware how much you put in. Price is moderate but if you love wanton noodles with chilli, you need to try this place. Add on fried wantons to complete your meal."
"Tasty, efficient and the chilli rocks."
"Good wonton noodles, and lots of parking behind.  Layout feels like old style Eatery across the Causeway, but food is good"
Authentic wanton mee!
Noodles cooked to perfection (cantonese al dente if there is such a thing). I'd marry the chilli sauce if my wife would let me.
Serving is small for the price compared to what you can get at hawker centres but taste more than makes up for it omg these guys put crack in this thing or something if I don't get my fix at least  twice a month I get withdrawal symptoms.
Good noodles with a strong taste of pork fat. Nothing like good comfort food. Order the side of fried wantons too to add to the heart clogging meal!
Great wan tan noodles! Char siew and chilli are superb! Portion a bit small for the prices charged.
Power Chili. Friend recommended me and really love their food. Pricing is average and serving is generous.
Not bad...
Unique Char Siew Wonton noodle with super spicy hot chili sauce.
"Great fried wonton, crispy and addictive."
One of the best wantan mee in singapore
Food is very good!
"Food is awesome. Tasty and fast service. The chili is to die for (literally). If you can't do chilli, don't try this at all."
Wonton noodle famous for its spicy chilli sauce
It's pretty good wanton mee but probably not as great as the hype suggests. Expect crowds and a queue.
My Favorite noodle place. Looking forward to eating here when I come back to Singapore next month!!!!!
Best Wonton noodle in Singapore
Lady boss is stingy on pork lard
One of the best wonton noodles in Singapore.
Old school wanton mee with super spicy chili sauce. Good comfort food.
chewy and thin noodle the kailan here is so good
"Boiled wanton is ok.
Wanton mee taste is really good old taste.
Chili in the bottle is truly shiok!

A little oily but well.....4 stars!!!"
"Very nice wan tan mee, with fried wantan to die for. Noodles are just the right level of springy for me, and chilli sauce compliments the noodles well."
"Excellent comfort food! The portions of char siew and wantons are generous, and accompany the taste of the noodles well. I find the chewy and firm texture of the noodles to go well with the savoury oil base that it is served with. A few of my friends dislike the texture of oil and noodles though."
Nice Wanton with good service.
Like the noodle texture and taste.
"Very spicy, a little goes a long way."
"Not cheap and portion small. The chili is good though, really solid chili."
Best wanton noodle with super hot chilli sauce
Awesome noodles with super hot chilli sauce
I expected a flavourful broth made from Ikan bilis or anchovies. But this was tasteless. The noodles are not chewy and tasteless. Although they have the standard char siew and wanton. Did not taste like the traditional wanton mee.
Yummy wanton noodles at affordable prices
A noodle stall with long history and still taste like how Wontan noodle should taste as far as I remember in my childhood days.
"It's a noodle just right for your money value, beside its good & very hot chili."
"$4.50 for a small bowl of wonton noodle is indeed overpriced, but I think the taste worths every cent. The saltiness and the amount of lard is just nice, and the hot spicy sauce gives an extra kick. It's one of the best wonton noodles I've ever eaten - another great one would be Xing Ji at Tampines Round Market."
Yummy wanton mee! Super spicy chilli!
Unique and delicious! A lucky find!
try the chili sauce!
Top tier Singapore style wanton noodle.
The highlight of this wanton mee place is their CHILI!
my friend told me about this noodle. he said it's one of the best here in Singapore. i agree.
"If you're looking for Insanely spicy chili for a great bowl of wonton noodles, this is the place."
Situated at the heart of Katong and offers the dry/semi-hard yellow noodles of wanton mee that is so difficult to find nowadays apart from the common soggy types. All noodles and dumplings are handmade!
I love their noodles. Definitely one of the best in SG.
One of the best wanton noodles in town.
"People come here for the savoury wantons, springy noodles and especially for the spicy chilli sauce. It's a good fix for your wanton mee cravings but there are still better ones out there (less crowded too)!"
Above average wanton mee but nothing worth travelling for
Best wantan noodle in town. Add chili sauce sparingly :p
Great wanton mee
Best part is the chilli. And the blanched vege is good.
Ramen noodle of Singapore!!!! The noodle itself is fantastically tasty.
Really good springy noodles with or without chilli (which is super spicy!) Good wanton as well!
Very delicious springy noodles with spicy hot chilli sauce.
Very good quality food. Noodles and soup are ace. Chilli is unbeatably spicy.
Pretty good mee and wontons. Large bowl costed 5.50 sing dollars and it is cheap for Singapore. Went there at 1 pm and had to wait for 20 minutes for a table. Seems like a popular place among locals. Nice meal
Amazing noodles but it is closed on Mondays
Good wanton noodles. Extra spicy chilli.
We had this place recommend to us by the locals. I ordered the wonton noodle soup which was amazing! Best one in Singapore! S9 glad we went and would recommend for anyone wanting some authentic Asian cuisine!
"A place to stop by if you are around. But I won't travel all the way just to have the noodles there.
Do give their chili a try, but a word of caution .... it is HOT."
Good Wanton Noodle and Excellent Chili
"The noodle's springy texture is distinctive and the extra spicy chili gives you the extra kick. Other than that, I'd say it's quite ordinary. The BBQ pork (char siew) and wanton are similar to those you get from any other noodle stall. Service is not fantastic. During peak hours, you would be arranged to share a tiny table with other customers which can be very cramped. The servers tend to collect the dish very promptly.  Try to avoid sitting near the entrance if you mind the cigarette smoke as the staff sometimes smoke near entrance which can be annoying."
Best wanton noodles with the Super spicy chilli...
Delicious chilli sauce which is unrivaled. Nice wanton noodles.
Very good wanton mee
Average price & food
Superb wanton mee - the noodles are not the typical wanton mee type but closer to Kalo mee type of noodles.
The chilli is really special. It makes the dish delicious. Otherwise the noodles though nice doesn't have the QQ texture. The wanton is slightly above average n tasty.
Chilli used just too spicy.  It basically number your taste buds.
"The wanton noodles here are very springy and delicious. The chili here is also amazing! However, the char siew should be better caramelized... The price of the food here ($4.50 for small and $5.50 for ""large"") is a bit high but a occasional visit should not be too bad on your wallet."
"My colleagues and I frequent this place when we hunger for wonton noodles. The noodles is springy and tasty like those from Sarawak, meat is delicious although the wonton is normal. Try the fried wonton instead, but it is a little small in size.

Their in-house chilli is really good."
"Extremely affordable, though the noodles are not super fantastic as what has so often been said."
Tasty wanton noodles but quite different from most I've tasted in Singapore. Wanton is very crispy.
Great authentic noodles with spicy sauce!
Great wonton mee although slightly pricey. But worth it
Simply horrible.
 One of the top 3 best WTM in SG. Very unique Chilli  sauce and springy noodles. Only good for you if you expect very local style WTM
Nothing fancy. Seems super organised.
food is not even edible...
"Since Eng left Dunman Road, and soon after passing on, the children does not know how to pass on his legacy. They create stupid rules in the new shop and are just very very rude. Now, the noodles are prepared by China workers hence nothing authentic. Prices are very high for such noodles. I have been eating Eng's for the past 47 years since everitt road kampong but I will pass when my cravings go high for Won Ton Noodles. How can u eat when the owners are rude.... Chiak bey lok"
"Very good 'old school' Singapore styled wantan mee. Don't come here expecting restaurant type service or restaurant style atmosphere. Often you have to share your table.

The Chili packs a punch so if you're not used to very spicy Chili, use in moderation. The noodles is springy and unlike the ones used commonly in normal wantan mee. The charsiew used is not the canto style but the old school type. The mix of the oil, noodles, touch of light soy sauce and Chili brings a sense of warmth to the stomach."
"Bad bad bad service, bad food. Not recommanded"
Spicy chilli. Not for the faint hearted
We eat a few bowls of Noodle & there is additional one bowl which my kids did not eat at all. So I asked to pack the noodle & ask for Chilli sauce.they refuse to give & said that is not a new order. I try to reason it out with the staff there but they refuse to give.we can add in the noodle but cannot pack it. I intend to have the Chilli in case my kids do not want to eat & I can finish it. What is the different if I make a new order? I still pay for the food. Why are they so not flexible?? I pay for the food & yet they not allow us to pack any Chilli?? So should I bring a small plastic to pack the Chilli ?
"To avoid disappointment, don't forget they're closed every second Monday! Schedule is on the wall on the left side of thing entrance."
"The noodle is like is ""al dente"" type for those who like. Please squeeze the chill sauce on the table sparingly, it's really really spicy. A must try for wanton noodle lovers."
Basic wanton noodles that serves really quickly to your table.
"It's not as nice as the past, when the late masterchef was still cooking the dish... yet it's still better than most wanton noodles that I've tried before. And it's just getting more and more costly by the day"
One of the best wanton noodles in Singapore.
"over-rated place. only good for their chilli, without their chilli, nothing is unique about their noodles or wanton. should be renamed Eng's Chilli House instead."
"Historic Wanton Mee

From what used to be a peddled stall to what it is now, many Singaporeans go here and reminisce along a good serving of wanton mee.. And look out for that chili too!

Okay:
Wanton Mee [lacked that oomph factor for me]

IG: eatsmorefun"
Best wanton mee in the area. (Watch out for the chili!)
"Very nice noodles and char siew but too dry for my taste. Chilli too hot for me too. Service is fast and managed to get seats for two during peak hour. Overall,  it's pretty good but not great. Just lacking that oomph."
Been there so many times till today will be my last. So many vacant seats but all reserve for dunno who. Ask me to share seat on a crampy table with two other person. Brainless there are at least 10 other empty tables around ! So unpleasant experience.  Never will I step in again.
"If you like local style noodles, this is your place to go. Very efficient seating even though this place is rather crowded; you can get a seat very fast."
"Had Wanton noodles, fried wanton,boiled wanton and boiled vegetables. Noodles as well as the wanton was good. Vegetable just normal but good for a balance meal :)"
"Nice Wanton Mee. Taste good. Old style. Oily.
Very hot chili. Warning on the chili sauce bottle about the spiciness!"
"Just the two of us eating out on a Sunday evening at 7pm. No queue no pushy or rude waiters, relatively easy to find seats, perhaps due to recent emergence of several eateries around the area. Focusing on the food, noodles is good springy type, portion is accordingly decent sized for the price you pay, i.e. go big if you are a big boy or girl. Wanton is alright, free pork lard if you are into that sort of thing and extra spicy chili sauce to give you extra kicks. Compared to nearby Fei Fei in joo chiat place this is more decent."
Service is good and fast. The taste is Better and bigger than Fei Fei wanton noodle. Overall I am quite satisfied with the food & quality.
"Am here at the shop now. Terrible customer servicr, wontan with no filling  or negligible amt of filling...feifei does better with the wontan.
But the chilli n noodle great tho....
Will not be coming back as often as i used to..
Not my money's worth."
The worst customer 'service' eatery in Singapore! ! ! It is as though customers owe them a living when patronizing them. The owners are totally obnoxious. Such attitude should not be condoned.
"They serve up a mean dish of wanton noodles, with a chilli sauce that's guaranteed to burst in one's mouth. Highly recommended for any noodle aficionados."
"One of the best wanton char siu noodle places. No air conditioning but the kind of place you are in and out of. Pickled green chili, side orders of vege, fried wanton etc"
"The staff made the worst mistake of all time.  DO NOT TELL CUSTOMERS TO LEAVE, especially when we still have unfinished drinks.  Customers will leave when done with their food, and my family has already showed signs of leaving, but the staff still come to chase us away.  We, customers have the right to have decent service regardless how high-class or low-class the place may be.  My family and I definitely will stop patronizing this noodle house and tell more friends not to patronize this shop."
"Eng's Noodle House is a ""brand name"" outlet, recently moved to Tanjong Katong. Many newspaper articles about this family business, but in recent times, standard has dropped somewhat. The noodles are springy and tasty, but beware the Chili sauce! Very very spicy and burns your mouth/tongue! Only for seasoned Chili lovers!"
Best noodles ever! Two thumbs up!
Come early to avoid long queues.
"It's all about the chili.
The chili is super hot.
The nozzle by itself is rather flavor bland and salty.
But the chili turns up all your senses, making basic flavors stand out.
Only for chili lovers."
Noodles are springy. Chilli sauce is SPICY. char siew and wanton are average
"Great noodles, great chilli. Must try!"
"Although they put a lot of fat and lard, but the chilli, the noodles and the wanton are all gr8."
"Noodles taste consistently good, but that's mostly because of the amount of oil (possibly lard?) that they put in it. A good weekend binge food!"
"I love the chillii, shiok ... "
The best wantan noodles in town. Simply divine!
The chilli is the power
One of the best wanton noodles in Singapore. Must try their chilli sauce!
Great food
One of the best Wantan mee in town. Must try!
My favorite wanton noodles in Singapore.
